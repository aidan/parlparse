	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">Given that the Assembly will have to carry out a new vote, I propose that the Council proceed in the same fashion and resume this meeting at 3.30 p.m. since the Council does not need to carry out a third round of voting until the General Assembly has a candidate who has obtained a majority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">The President of the General Assembly will inform me of the candidate who has obtained a majority in the Assembly. If it is the same candidate who obtained a majority in the Council's second round of voting, that candidate will have been elected.</p>

Members will also recall that, in the second ballot in the Security Council this morning, one candidate for the remaining one vacancy received an absolute majority.

	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">As members of the Council will recall, the General Assembly conducted a fourth ballot to fill the remaining one vacancy for the International Court of Justice. I have been informed that, in the General Assembly, the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo informed the Assembly that his national group had decided to withdraw its nomination of Mr. Sayeman Bula-Bula as a candidate for membership of the Court. Since Mr. Bula-Bula had been nominated only by the national group of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, his name was not included in the fourth ballot conducted by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">I have been informed that the votes have been counted in the General Assembly and that one candidate has obtained an absolute majority.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Members of the Council will recall that in the second ballot in the Security Council this morning, one candidate for the remaining one vacancy received an absolute majority. The result of the second ballot is as follows:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg003-bk02-pa04"><i>Number of ballot papers</i>: 15 <i>Number of invalid ballots</i>: 0 <i>Number of valid ballots</i>: 15 <i>Required majority</i>: 8</blockquote>

	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">Accordingly, Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf has received the required majority of votes in the Security Council and I have communicated the result of the vote to the President of the General Assembly in writing.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">I should like to inform the members of the Council that I have just received from the President of the General Assembly the following letter:</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">"I have the honour to inform you that at the 40th plenary meeting of the General Assembly, which was held today for the purpose of electing five members of the International Court of Justice, the following candidate received the required majority of votes in the General Assembly: Mr. Abdulgawi Ahmed Yusuf."</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">As both the Security Council and the General Assembly have agreed on the same candidate, the distinguished jurist Mr. Abdulgawi Ahmed Yusuf has been elected a member of the International Court of Justice for a term of office of nine years, beginning on 6 February 2009.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">On behalf of the Security Council, I should like to congratulate the five candidates elected today -- Mr. Ronny Abraham, Mr. Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, Mr. Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade, Mr. Christopher Greenwood and Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf -- and to wish them every success in the high office to which they have been elected.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">Also on behalf of the Council, I would like to thank the tellers for their assistance in the conduct of the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
