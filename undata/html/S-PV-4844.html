	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I now give the floor to the Secretary-General.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01"> May I commend the members of the Security Council for having reached this significant agreement on what, obviously, is a particularly important resolution to address the complex situation in Iraq. The process has been difficult. But the outcome is a clear demonstration of the will of all the members of the Security Council to place the interests of the Iraqi people above all other considerations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">Our common objective is to restore peace and stability to a sovereign, democratic and independent Iraq as quickly as possible. It is critical to the Iraqi people, the region and the entire international community that we succeed in reaching the goal of an Iraq that is at peace with itself and with its neighbours, and is contributing to stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">As Secretary-General, I shall do my utmost to implement the mandate established by the Security Council, bearing in mind the constraints on building up the required capacity and my obligation to care for the safety and security of United Nations staff. I am grateful to the Council for the flexibility that the new resolution gives me in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Although at this moment the United Nations has only a skeletal presence on the ground, we are determined to continue helping the Iraqi people as best we can, from both inside and outside the country, primarily in providing humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">As circumstances permit, I plan to proceed with the other tasks indicated in the resolution. I have no doubt that we all look forward to the earliest possible establishment of an elected Government that will return Iraq to full sovereignty.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk09">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">An overall appraisal of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a>, which we have just adopted, is contained in the joint French-German-Russian statement distributed to members. In addition, we should like to emphasize that, from the moment that work on the draft resolution began, the Russian Federation was guided by the objectives of promoting the earliest possible political settlement, under United Nations auspices, of the situation in Iraq; helping the Iraqi people to regain their sovereignty; and preventing a situation whereby the Iraq crisis would destabilize the situation in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">A continuation of the trends towards a crisis in Iraq serves no one's interests. Therefore, it is essential that international efforts be united in the search for a long-term and stable political settlement that will enable the Iraqi people to take their country's leadership into their own hands through a legitimately elected Government and that will allow Iraq's neighbours to feel secure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">We are pleased that, as a result of the efforts of Russia, France, Germany, China and other members of the Security Council -- together with those of the Secretary-General -- we were able, during the course of negotiations with the draft resolution's sponsors, to arrive at a resolution that provides a real chance for the Iraqi situation to make a transition from the occupation phase to a phase of practical measures to restore Iraqi sovereignty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">The resolution unambiguously stresses the Iraqi people's right to determine its own political future and to manage its own natural resources. There is provision for the elaboration of a specific timetable for the political process, including the adoption of an Iraqi constitution and the formation of a Government through democratic elections. There is recognition of the significance of support on the part of States in the region -- first and foremost Iraq's neighbours -- for that process, and emphasis is placed on the need to undertake concrete measures at this stage to transfer leadership and administrative functions to the Iraqis themselves. With the election of an internationally recognized Government of Iraq, the authority of the occupying Powers will completely end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">Although under the current circumstances -- in which Iraq has lacked security -- the United Nations has not been in a position to play a full-fledged role in bringing order to the country, the resolution gives the Secretary-General the right to take decisions, within the framework of the political process, regarding timetables and modalities for, inter alia, forming the membership of a constitutional conference and the holding of elections. We are convinced that, as the Iraqi situation is stabilized, the United Nations will carry out the powers reserved to it in the spheres where it truly can and must lead. It is an important matter of principle that the Secretary-General report to the Security Council on the course of the political process in all of its aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">Yet another very important point is the agreement on the mandate approved by the Security Council for the multinational force. In the final, agreed version, its functions -- as Russia believes -- are subordinate to the tasks of promoting the restoration of Iraq's sovereignty, and as soon as that happens the multinational force's mandate will expire. If the legitimately elected Government of Iraq requests some form of assistance to maintain security, then the Security Council will consider such a request. This provision of the resolution -- along with the regular reports that it requires of the Secretary-General, the leaders of the multinational force and the Coalition Provisional Authority -- guarantees permanent Security Council control over the political settlement and the overall restoration of Iraq. The Council can make the necessary amendments to that process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">In the economic sphere, the resolution recalls the need to ensure complete transparency in the activities of the Development Fund for Iraq, including through the swift establishment of an International Advisory and Monitoring Board, whose formation has clearly been delayed for too long without any convincing reason. The resolution also fails to address such pending issues as the problem of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the fate of those missing in action during the course of the first Gulf War and Kuwaiti property. However, it is clear that the Security Council will still have to address those problems, in conformity with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">On the whole, of course, the new resolution is not ideal. Not all of its provisions have managed to provide for the necessary conditions. The result we have achieved is a compromise that does not resolve all the problems. However, at this stage, in the light of all the factors, we see more pluses in the resolution than minuses. It is fundamentally important that, during the negotiations, we were able to achieve a consensus in the Security Council -- something to which Russia attached priority significance from the outset.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">Now, all of us, as members of the international community -- and first and foremost the occupying Powers -- must do our utmost to accomplish the fundamental task set out in the resolution, to see to it that the day will come as swiftly as possible when the Iraqis can manage their own future. Once again, we emphasize that the resolution provides the conditions necessary for that. Our overall obligation is to do everything we can so that the goals set out in the resolution do not remain dead letters but are actually implemented. Only then will the efforts expended to reach agreement on the resolution be justified.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I, too, would like to welcome the presence of the Secretary-General at this meeting. We would like to make a few comments relating to our vote.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The resolution just adopted takes up important concerns of the post-war order in Iraq. It further develops the preceding <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1483 (2003)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1500 (2003)</a>, on Iraq, and contains new emphases. In our view, the sponsors of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a> have undertaken commendable efforts to reach a text that accommodates important claims we have made. That we expressly recognize, and that was one of the factors for our approval.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Another factor was that we and the sponsors share the same goals in Iraq: to contribute to a swift stabilization of the conditions in Iraq, to support the political and economic reconstruction process in Iraq, and to promote the restoration of the Iraqi people's sovereignty through a Government democratically elected by them. That can succeed only when the Security Council appears as unified as possible. We therefore did not want to stand in the way of Council unity.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Although we consider the resolution to be an important step in the right direction, we remain of the view that integration of the amendments presented by Germany, France and the Russian Federation could have led to a better resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">We miss the clear signal that the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis will be accelerated. The role of the United Nations, and in particular of the Secretary-General, could have been strengthened even more. The Council, too, is incorporated rather sparingly into the development.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">Finally, we would have wished for clearer guidelines also with regard to timing. The latter seems important to us because only in this way can it be made clear that the current political status of Iraq is a temporary one. In this context, I refer to the joint statement of Russia, France and Germany explaining our common position. We therefore cannot envisage any military commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">We remain, however, firmly optimistic that an even broader involvement of the United Nations -- and in particular of the Secretary-General -- the Iraqi people and the neighbours in the region in the reconstruction process in Iraq will succeed.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De La Sablière</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I welcome the presence among us of the Secretary-General at this important meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">France, Germany and Russia decided to support the resolution we have just adopted and to agree on the text of a joint statement to be issued here in New York.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">With so much at stake, we feel that the text of the resolution should have gone farther. It would have been extremely desirable in particular for a clear text to set nearer and stricter deadlines for the transfer of responsibilities and the political transition. We also remain convinced that, in order to allow for the reconstruction and stabilization of Iraq, the sovereign assumption by the Iraqis of their own destiny is a necessary starting point to restore political prospects for the Iraqis; to marginalize those in Iraq who have chosen violence; and to mobilize the international community on behalf of Iraq. Furthermore, we believe that it is absolutely necessary for the United Nations to play a lead role in assistance to the Iraqi people in successfully managing the political process.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">We recognize, however, that the authors of the resolution, throughout the negotiations, took a number of our amendments into consideration -- with regard, for example, to the roles of the Security Council and the Secretary-General or to transparency in the use of the Development Fund for Iraq. The text can also create institutional momentum in the right direction.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">In the context of the spiral of violence and terrorism in Iraq and of extreme tension in the Middle East as a whole, we wish to make unity in the Council a priority. We wish to believe that today's resolution marks a first step that we feel will be followed by others, equally indispensable.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">The unanimous vote this morning in favour of the resolution, in the presence of the Secretary-General, is excellent news for the people of Iraq, for the Security Council and for the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">Throughout the constructive negotiations that characterized the preparation of this resolution, the United Kingdom saw three main objectives for the resolution: first, to confirm and accelerate the transfer of power to the people of Iraq; secondly, to send a clear signal that the international community is committed to the rapid political and economic reconstruction of a free Iraq which is secure and stable; and thirdly, to ensure, as conditions permit, a strengthened, vital role for the United Nations, in partnership with the Coalition Provisional Authority and, most importantly, with the Iraqi people.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">On the transfer of power, the resolution we have adopted is quite clearly about giving control of Iraq to its people as quickly as possible. Quite rightly, however, the resolution does not prescribe to the Iraqis artificial schedules for that transfer. Instead, it puts the people of Iraq in the driving seat through the Iraqi interim administration. It reaffirms Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity and the temporary nature of the Coalition's powers. It adds increased impetus, structure and clarity to the political process. It sets a deadline of two months from today by which the Governing Council should provide a timeline and the programme leading to an Iraqi constitution and democratic elections, and it engages the Security Council in this process. As I argued during the negotiations, it does not rule out moving to a provisional Government if that is likely to lead more rapidly and in more stable conditions to a democratic Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">On the commitment of the international community, the resolution encourages United Nations Member States and international bodies to support the reconstruction of Iraq, including in particular through substantial pledges at the Madrid International Donors Conference. It builds on the international efforts which already involve over 30 countries in Iraq today by establishing a multinational force that will help protect the United Nations mission and ensure the conditions of security and stability needed for political and economic reconstruction to succeed.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">On the part played by the United Nations, the resolution we have adopted gives the Secretary-General discretion to strengthen that role. Indeed, it asks him to do so across a wide range of areas he had previously identified, including in national dialogue, consensus-building and the electoral and constitutional processes. While the underlying assumption in this resolution is that the Council wants the United Nations to play an enhanced role, it also reflects realities on the ground. It will be for the Secretary-General rightly to determine the exact role as circumstances permit, but the United Kingdom welcomes the Secretary-General's statement this morning and looks forward to working with him and the Secretariat on the implementation of this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">This resolution focuses on the practicable, not the theoretical; on what will work for the Iraqi people as the processes under way move forward, not on some blueprint imposed from New York. The United Kingdom hopes and believes that this unanimously adopted resolution represents a further strengthening of our joint efforts, supported by the unique expertise of the United Nations, to build a better Iraq. As the resolution makes clear, progress in Iraq will be all the more swift if we put aside the divisions of the past, as we have done this morning, and put foremost in our minds the need to unite in order to meet the current needs of the Iraqi people.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">To that end, the success of this resolution will be secured if all of us in the Council and in the international community now mobilize to give effect to the signal we have sent. We are united in wanting to secure as rapidly as possible a democratic, secure and stable Iraq governed by Iraqis for Iraqis.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Guangya</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The Chinese delegation welcomes the Secretary-General and thanks him for his important statement.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The Chinese delegation voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a>, which the Security Council has just adopted. In view of the situation in Iraq and the common aspirations of the international community, China consistently maintained that it was necessary for the Security Council to adopt a new resolution so as to help Iraq to achieve peace and stability, restore sovereignty and bring about economic and social development as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The text of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a> is a marked improvement over that of the original draft presented by the delegation of the United States. It incorporates a number of reasonable ideas and suggestions from all the parties concerned, including China. The resolution will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the endeavour to promote the political process in Iraq, accelerate the transfer of power from the Coalition Provisional Authority to the Iraqi people, gradually strengthen the role of the United Nations and increase transparency in Iraq's economic reconstruction. Those are the reasons why we voted in favour.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">There is a broad consensus of all the parties that -- as is the fervent desire of the Iraqi people -- a leading role should be ensured for the United Nations in the political process in Iraq, and that there should be an early restoration of Iraq's sovereignty, in order to achieve the goal of an Iraq run by the Iraqi people. Like many other Member States, we have consistently held that the resolution should contain clear and explicit provisions on these major questions. To that end, we adopted a forward-looking and practical approach during consultations, with the earnest hope of achieving broad consensus among Council members.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">During consultations on the draft, France, Germany, Russia and many others put forward a series of sound suggestions, and the Secretary-General also made some important comments. We emphasized on many occasions the need for the sponsors of the draft resolution to accord those suggestions serious consideration, and it would have been better if it had incorporated more of them. The fact that we voted in favour of the resolution, therefore, does not mean that we are fully satisfied with its contents.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The Security Council has an obligation and responsibility to remain actively seized of the matter. It has adopted almost 70 resolutions on the question of Iraq. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1511 (2003)</a> will not be the last. As the situation develops there, the Security Council should further consider, in a timely fashion, such questions as how to reinforce the important role of the United Nations in the Iraqi political process and how to speed up the restoration of sovereignty to Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">It should be pointed out that history and experience have proved that a definitive and desirable solution to the Iraqi question calls for concerted efforts and extensive participation by the international community. In this regard, the views of the vast majority of the Arab and Islamic countries, especially Iraq's neighbours, should be fully respected.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">I conclude by reiterating that the Chinese Government and people are greatly concerned about the current situation in Iraq and attach importance to the country's political and economic reconstruction. We hope that, with the strong support of the international community and the active assistance of the United Nations, Iraq, which has suffered so greatly from the hardships of war, will see the early restoration of its sovereignty and embark on the path of peace, stability and development. China is ready to continue to work tirelessly to contribute to that end.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I join my colleagues in welcoming the Secretary-General at this important meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">Pakistan is happy that the Security Council was able to act unanimously on the resolution, and we commend the flexibility demonstrated by all Council members. Pakistan voted in favour of the resolution, and I would like to say a few words to explain our position.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Pakistan's position, both before and after the war in Iraq early this year, has been guided by our concern for the welfare of the fraternal people of Iraq and for their country. Pakistan did not support the war. In its aftermath, our concern has been to ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance to the suffering Iraqi people, to restore the security and stability of their country and to ensure the earliest restoration of its sovereignty and political independence.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The resolutions adopted by the Security Council since the war -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1472(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1472 (2003)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1476(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1476 (2003)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1483 (2003)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1500(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1500 (2003)</a> -- were, in our view, designed to take the first steps towards realizing those objectives. Several steps have been taken towards those objectives in Iraq, including the organization of humanitarian assistance, the revival of administrative structures and the establishment of a Governing Council which was considered by the Security Council to be broadly representative.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Unfortunately, the situation in Iraq has evolved in ways that have aroused regional and international concern. In particular, the security environment has not improved. Attacks have occurred on the foreign military and civilian presence in the country. Tragically, even the United Nations, present in Iraq to assist the Iraqi people, was targeted in the devastating attack of 19 August, costing the lives of 22 United Nations personnel, including the head of the United Nations Mission, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Since then, guerrilla and terrorist attacks have occurred with numbing regularity, as listed in the fifth preambular paragraph and operative paragraph 18 of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">We viewed the initiation of the resolution as an opportunity to address those concerns and to create a structure that could lead to the early restoration of Iraq's sovereignty and political independence. We supported the resolution because, despite the complexity and contradictions of parts of the text, we believe that its fundamental objectives are the restoration of sovereignty and the transfer of authority to the people of Iraq, the improvement of the security environment, the promotion of economic reconstruction and the expeditious provision of relief.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">The resolution would have gained considerably in clarity and credibility if it had clearly stipulated the principles which should guide the political transition and the maintenance of security and reconstruction in Iraq: respect for Iraq's political independence, unity and territorial integrity; the right of the Iraqi people to choose their own political destiny and form of Government; permanent sovereignty and control over their natural resources; and non-intervention and non-interference in their internal affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">We would also have liked a clearer process for the early restoration of Iraq's sovereignty and the quick transfer of power and authority to the Iraqi people to enable them to control their political future and their economic resources. That is an inalienable right of the people of Iraq, and, like other peoples, they are entitled to exercise that right without unnecessary delay.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">Nevertheless, we have noted that the text reaffirms the temporary nature of the exercise by the Coalition Provisional Authority of its specific responsibilities and obligations under international law. We hope that the timetable that has been indicated in the text will be accelerated with a view to ending occupation expeditiously and that the Iraqi interim authority will be quickly constituted through a broad and inclusive political process incorporating political elements which at present remain outside the Governing Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">The political process for the restoration of full Iraqi sovereignty would have gained in credibility and acceptability within Iraq and internationally if it had been conducted under the authority and auspices of the United Nations. We understand the concerns and constraints of the Secretary-General, which prevent the presence of United Nations international staff on the ground in Iraq. The security environment must improve in order to enable the United Nations and other international organizations to play a full and impartial role in Iraq's transition to political independence. Yet the supervision of that process by the United Nations can itself contribute to creating the confidence among the Iraqi people that is essential to promoting a climate of security. We therefore trust that the circumstances referred to in the resolution which would enable the Secretary-General to play an active role in Iraq's political process will arrive as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">Pakistan is confident that despite the tragedy of 19 August, the United Nations will not be prepared to abdicate its responsibilities to the Iraqi people. We welcome the Secretary-General's statement this morning in that context. A United Nations role in overseeing and assisting the political transition in Iraq can be discharged, in our view, without incurring unacceptable risks to United Nations personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">The deployment of credible military capabilities in Iraq is no doubt essential at present to create an environment of security within which the political process and Iraq's reconstruction can be implemented. However, the forces deployed must be acceptable to the Iraqi people and must evoke their full cooperation. Otherwise, they will be unable to impose security. On the contrary, their presence might intensify insecurity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa13">It is for that reason that, during our consultations on the draft resolution, Pakistan consistently advocated that the multinational force which was to be created should have a identity separate and distinct from the occupation forces and that its deployment should be the result of an invitation from the Iraqi people and should take place with the concurrence of the other States of the region. Unfortunately, those considerations could not be reflected in the resolution we have just adopted. Under these circumstances, Pakistan will not be able to contribute troops to the multinational force in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa14">There are widespread concerns that the security situation in Iraq may deteriorate. To prevent that, the coalition Powers and those assisting them must be able to win the confidence of the Iraqi people and to convince them that they are working to promote their interests. Unless that aspect of the situation is fully addressed, there will continue to be resistance from those in Iraq who feel excluded from the political process -- apart from the additional dimension of terrorism, which has emerged with greater frequency in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa15">We are all agreed that this resolution is not the last word on Iraq. Pakistan continues to believe that the international community would do well to open a process of broad consultations which would involve the Iraqi people and the Arab and Islamic countries in order to evolve a consensus on how best to restore Iraq's sovereignty and political independence, improve its security environment and promote its reconstruction. Pakistan stands ready to contribute to such a process. We are deeply committed to ensuring the welfare of the Iraqi people, restoring their sovereignty and political independence, ensuring Iraq's unity and territorial integrity and promoting peace and stability in the entire region.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa16">Pakistan shares strong bonds of faith, culture and history with the Iraqi people and with other States in the region. We fully support their aspirations. We will extend all possible cooperation in ways and means acceptable to them to realize those aspirations.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I, too, would like to welcome the presence at this meeting of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. The Syrian Arab Republic joined the Security Council consensus and voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a>. We did so after consultations with the representatives of France, Russia, Germany and China and with the representatives of the other States elected to the Council, and after contacts between my country and countries with which we have relations of friendship and cooperation, among them Japan.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Even though the resolution does not respond to all our expectations, which are closely linked to the aspirations of the Iraqi people to freedom and independence, we hope that the resolution will represent an incentive and a further step along that road and that the commitments set out in the resolution will be fulfilled in order to accelerate the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis, with a view to the adoption of a constitution and the formation of an internationally recognized elected and representative Government. We hope too that the resolution will promote the role of the United Nations and the Secretary-General, especially because the stability of the situation in Iraq and the safeguarding of its sovereignty and territorial integrity are very important to Syria and other neighbouring countries and will have a positive impact on the situation in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Syria will continue to make every possible effort to respond to the needs of the Iraqi people and will endeavour to alleviate their suffering and provide them with what they need for stability and security.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I wish to convey the Spanish delegation's unreserved satisfaction that this resolution, so important for the future of Iraq, was unanimously adopted. Spain was a resolute sponsor of the draft resolution, convinced that it constituted an important step towards improving the lives of the them and restoring to them control of their own destiny. We believe that the resolution is good news for the Iraqi people, for the region and for the United Nations. Iraq deserved -- and deserves -- the sincere consensus of the Security Council and its undivided support and unity. It is a people who have suffered three decades of dictatorship and who must see a better future before it. The resolution should help to achieve that.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The region will also benefit from a country that is moving towards normalcy and that certainly will have the cooperation of neighbouring countries and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Lastly, it is good news for this Council and the United Nations, because differences of the past are being reduced. From the unity, which we trust will be unrestricted, we will be able to make efforts that will be beneficial to those who most need them -- in other words, the people of Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">I would like to express best wishes for the donors conference in Madrid, to which this resolution gives the momentum that many of us wanted and called for. We believe that that conference can and must be a milestone in the development of the Iraqi people.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa01">I welcome the Secretary-General to the Council and thank him for his introductory remarks, as well as for his important contribution to the discussions that preceded the adoption of this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa02">Bulgaria has just voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a>. My delegation is extremely gratified at its unanimous adoption because it believes that, first, the resolution sends a strong political message to the Iraqi people to tell them that the time when they will regain full control over their own destiny is now within reach. The interim Governing Council is now officially recognized as an interlocutor with the international community in Iraq. Bulgaria welcomes this.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa03">Secondly, the resolution sends the message to the international community, which is encouraged to give the Iraqis its full support in the reconstruction of their country. For its part, Bulgaria will continue to help Iraq -- a country with which we have close, friendly ties -- particularly through the participation of a Bulgarian contingent in the newly created multinational force.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa04">Throughout the discussions on the text of the resolution, my delegation insisted that it take into account the wish of the Secretary-General to have maximum flexibility in carrying out the United Nations mandate in Iraq, depending on the situation on the ground -- especially the security situation -- so as not to subject United Nations staff to unnecessary risk. I wish to thank the sponsors of the resolution for accepting this proposal from the Bulgarian delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa05">The positive political message in the resolution we have just adopted was considerably broadened in the way it was adopted -- that is, unanimously. Ultimately, the positions of the majority of the Council members turned out to be not so different as we might have believed at first. We welcome the fact that a last effort was made to allow for that unanimity to emerge.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk03-pa06">There can be no doubt that this will not be the last Council resolution on Iraq. Others will follow on the path set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a> in order to foster the emergency of a sovereign, united, stable and democratic Iraq.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Maquieira</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I would like to welcome the Secretary-General to our meeting today and to thank him for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Chile voted in favour of the resolution for the following reasons. Its adoption opened a new stage in the political, economic and social reconstruction of Iraq. This resolution should be analysed, along with other Security Council resolutions that gradually transmit authority to the United Nations in the post-conflict phase.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The resolution contains a number of measures for political transition and the role of the Untied Nations. In the political sphere, before 15 December the Governing Council will have to send to the Security Council a timetable for drawing up a new constitution and for holding democratic elections. Similarly, in view of the complexity of the security situation, the resolution allows that it be the Secretary-General who decides, in the final analysis, on participation of United Nations staff in the process. This is an essential point for the Organization to be able to carry out its functions efficiently. In this context we ask the Secretary-General to inform the Security Council of progress made in the process of transferring power to the authorities and people of Iraq, and the responsibilities and powers of government.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Moreover, there will be a constitutional conference that, if it is broadly representative, will be a milestone for the full restoration of the Iraqi people's sovereignty. Also, we envisage an important role for the United Nations in various reconstruction efforts. These include the facilitating of a national dialogue, electoral and humanitarian assistance, the promotion of human rights, help in developing civil society, training the police and judicial and public administration reform.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">If we compare the resolution adopted with the initial text, we can see that there is a series of important changes and developments and a multilateral focus to tackle the situation in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Finally, the general consensus we have achieved today is an example of the Security Council's ability, in spite of the divisions that have arisen, to arrive at understandings, of which the Iraqi people should be the only beneficiary.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">First, let me again thank the Secretary-General for his presence here today, his important statement and his commitment to lend his full support to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1511(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1511 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">Today's vote is a vote for the future of Iraq. By its unanimous adoption of this resolution, the international community has demonstrated its wholehearted support for the people of Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">During the past six weeks, we have engaged in intense and constructive discussions about the role of the international community in Iraq. My Government has listened carefully to the concerns of each Council member, and we greatly appreciate the thorough exchange of views. The end result of our dialogue is a strengthened resolution, a resolution that will enlarge the international community's participation in Iraq's stabilization and reconstruction. Extending both hands to a key country in a strategic region wi11 serve our mutual interests in peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">We started these discussions in the wake of the devastating trio of terrorist bombings in Baghdad: at the Jordanian embassy, United Nations headquarters and the Imam Ali mosque. Those actions represented an assault on the new Iraq, as did the tragic assassination of Governing Council member Dr. Akila al-Hashimi. To meet this challenge, it was necessary to recommit the international community and, in so doing, expand the opportunities for participation by Member States, regional organizations and the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">In crafting this resolution, we never lost sight of conditions on the ground. Our consistent aim has been to support the Iraqis and those who have joined them in this unprecedented stabilization, reconstruction and recovery effort.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">The resolution has four key elements. First, it confirms Iraqi leadership in establishing a political horizon for the transfer of power and makes clear that the interim Iraqi leadership embodies Iraqi sovereignty during the transition. In this regard, the resolution also reaffirms a point that the United States has never left in doubt: the exercise of governmental authorities in Iraq by the Coalition Provisional Authority is temporary in nature. We will not waver from our stated objective of transferring governing responsibilities and authorities to the people of Iraq as soon as practicable.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">Secondly, in addressing the crucially important process of political transition, the resolution provides for an expanded United Nations role, commensurate with the United Nations unique experience and expertise, subject to United Nations capacity in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Thirdly, the resolution establishes a United Nations authorized multinational force under unified United States command and provides a platform for contributions to the training and equipping of Iraqi police and security forces.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Fourthly, the resolution encourages the international financial institutions and others to provide significant and sustained contributions to the reconstruction and development of Iraq's economy as tangible proof of their commitment to the economic health and political stability of Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">By addressing the triad of politics, economics and security, the resolution offers a solid base for expanded international engagement. My Government's careful consideration of text during these past weeks reflects our commitment to a multilateral approach to this compelling matter. We welcome those who have joined us, including of course the co-sponsors, and urge all States to review how they might best contribute to Iraqi efforts to forge a better future. If there ever was a time to help Iraq, it is now.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa12">I resume my function as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council will remain seized of this matter.</p>
