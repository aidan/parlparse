	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-1995-720.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/720</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 21 August 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Tajikistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the Protocol on the fundamental principles for establishing peace and national accord in Tajikistan signed by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the leader of the Tajik opposition on 17 August 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-720.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/720</a>, annex). It commends the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Envoy and all countries acting as observers at the inter-Tajik talks, which have significantly contributed to reaching the above agreement between the Tajik parties.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council calls upon the parties to implement fully the commitments contained in the Protocol. It supports the agreement of the parties to conduct the continual round of talks due to begin on 18 September 1995, with the aim of concluding a general agreement on the establishment of peace and national accord in Tajikistan and urges the parties to agree as soon as possible on the venue of the negotiations. It reiterates that the primary responsibility rests with the Tajik parties themselves in resolving their differences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the agreement reached by the parties to extend the Agreement on a Temporary Cease-Fire and the Cessation of Other Hostile Acts on the Tajik-Afghan Border and within the Country signed in Teheran on 17 September 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1102.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1102</a>, annex 1) for a period of six months until 26 February 1996, and calls upon the parties to comply strictly with the obligations assumed under this agreement, including cessation of all hostile acts on the Tajik-Afghan border and within Tajikistan. The Council calls upon all States and others concerned to discourage any activities that could complicate or hinder the peace process respecting fully the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Tajikistan and the inviolability of the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council urges the parties to implement as quickly as possible the confidence-building measures agreed upon during the fourth round of inter-Tajik talks held in Almaty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council stresses the need to continue the existing close contacts of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) with the parties to the conflict as well as its close liaison with the CIS Collective Peace-keeping forces, with the Russian border forces and with the OSCE Mission in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the contributions by some Member States to the voluntary fund for contributions established by the Secretary-General in accordance with its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-968(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 968 (1994)</a>, and reiterates its encouragement to other Member States to contribute thereto.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its readiness to consider in due course the recommendations of the Secretary-General regarding the possible role of the United Nations in the context of the present and future agreements between the Tajik parties."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-42.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/42</a>.</p>
