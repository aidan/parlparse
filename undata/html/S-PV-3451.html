<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council recalls the statements made by the President of the Council on 8 April 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-25562.pdf" class="nolink">S/25562</a>), 31 March 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-13.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/13</a>) and 30 May 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/28</a>) and its relevant resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms the critical importance of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the Treaty) and the contribution which progress in non-proliferation makes to the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction the Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)' (Agreed Framework) of 21 October 1994 as a positive step in the direction of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace and security in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council notes that the parties to the Agreed Framework decided to (1) cooperate in replacing the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities with light-water reactor power plants, (2) move towards full normalization of political and economic relations, (3) work together for peace and security on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and (4) work together to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council takes note of the decision of the DPRK in the Agreed Framework to remain a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It notes also the DPRK's decision to come into full compliance with the IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement (<a href="../pdf/INFCIRC-403.pdf" class="nolink">INFCIRC/403</a>) under the Treaty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council underlines that the Safeguards Agreement remains binding and in force and looks to the DPRK to act thereon. The Council requests the IAEA to take all steps it may deem necessary, following consultations between the IAEA and DPRK with regard to verifying the accuracy and completeness of the DPRK's initial report on all nuclear material in the DPRK, to verify full DPRK compliance with the IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council notes with approval the DPRK decision in the Agreed Framework to freeze its graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities, which is a voluntary measure beyond what is required by the Treaty and the IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council, having received an oral report from the Director General of the IAEA, notes further that IAEA monitoring activities with respect to such a voluntary measure are within the scope of verification activities under the IAEA-DPRK Safeguards Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council requests the IAEA to take all steps it may deem necessary as a consequence of the Agreed Framework to monitor the freeze.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council also requests the IAEA to continue to report to it on implementation of the Safeguards Agreement until the DPRK has come into full compliance with the Agreement and to report to the Council on its activities related to monitoring the freeze of the specified facilities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of the Joint Declaration by the DPRK and the Republic of Korea on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and welcomes the decision of the</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">DPRK to take steps consistently to implement that Declaration and to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Korea, as the Agreed Framework will help create an atmosphere that promotes such dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council will remain seized of the matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-64.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/64</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
