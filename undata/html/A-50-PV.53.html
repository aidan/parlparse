	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">This morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The five non-permanent outgoing members are the following: Argentina, the Czech Republic, Nigeria, Oman and Rwanda. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in 1996 the following States: Botswana, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia and Italy. The names of those States, therefore, should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members which will remain in office in 1996 two are from Africa and Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are from the Group of Western European and Other States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: three from Africa and Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">In accordance with the established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the three States to be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa09">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The statement that has just been made by the Chairman of the Asian Group is not accurate. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has expressed its strong objection to the Asian candidate for the Security Council. South Korea's membership of the Council would not contribute to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the region, as the Korean Peninsula is still in a state of war.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">My delegation requests Member States to pay serious attention to the deteriorating situation on the Korean Peninsula as a consequence of meaningless competition for a Security Council seat.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk11">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kulla</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa01">I have the honour to introduce the candidature of the Republic of Albania for the non-permanent seat on the Security Council allocated to the Eastern European Group for the term 1996-1997.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">The Charter of the United Nations stipulates that, in electing non-permanent members of the Security Council, the General Assembly will pay due regard to the contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and also to equitable geographical distribution. My country meets these criteria required by this supreme document of the United Nations. Albania has respected the Charter and has actively cooperated with the Organization. It has faithfully implemented the resolutions of the General Assembly and those of the Security Council. It has joined in all constructive initiatives in favour of international peace and security and has been a factor for stability in its region by promoting good-neighbourliness.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">Albania and the Albanians endeavour to ensure that dialogue and understanding are the first and the main means of resolving conflicts. My country is on the list of States that contribute personnel to United Nations peace-keeping operations, and we have taken measures to participate further therein.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">Meanwhile, the Republic of Albania has discharged its financial obligations to the Organization in respect of both the regular budget and the peace-keeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">The election of Albania would also serve to achieve a more equitable geographical distribution in the membership of the Security Council. It is some years since any country from our subregion has served on the Council. I should like to stress that during the 40 years of its membership of the United Nations -- since 1955 -- Albania has never served on the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">Expressing my country's readiness to continue on its path of contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security, I assure the Assembly that Albania is ready to play its role in the Council, fully aware of the responsibilities that rest on a non-permanent member of this main organ of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">Finally, I express the hope that Member States will vote for the candidature of Albania.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">I wish to confirm that Poland is a candidate for a Security Council seat for the term 1996-1997.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">I should like to emphasize that six years ago we expressed our willingness to serve on the Council during the period 1996-1997, and we started our campaign a couple of years ago. I have extensively presented our candidature in meetings with Permanent Representatives here, pointing out our involvement in United Nations activities in different fields, including peace-keeping operations, to which we are among the largest contributors.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">Let me just mention that this time, in a way, will be the first time for Poland in the Security Council. Although we already served on the Council, nevertheless it was under totally different political circumstances. This time, for the first time in the history of the United Nations and the history of Poland, we will have a chance to speak with our own voice, and we want to use it for the benefit of the community of States. This is why we count on the support of the membership of the United Nations.</p>
