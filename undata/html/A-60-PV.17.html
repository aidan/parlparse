	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">May I invite the General Assembly to direct its attention to section I of the report of the Committee. In that section, the General Committee took note of the information contained in paragraphs 2 and 3.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">May I request the General Assembly to now direct its attention to section II, entitled "Organization of the session", which contains a number of recommendations concerning the General Committee, rationalization of work, opening and closing dates for the session, schedule of meetings, the general debate, conduct of the meetings, and so on. All of those recommendations concern established practice, so rather than going through them one by one, I believe it would be better and more efficient that we address all of these organizational matters concerning the General Assembly as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">As there are no comments on that approach, we shall proceed accordingly.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">Having also just adopted the recommendation in paragraph 20 on waiving the requirements of rule 67 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly to declare a meeting open, I should like to endorse the practical suggestion that has been made at previous sessions: that each delegation designate someone to be present in the meeting rooms at the scheduled time.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">In paragraph 54, the General Assembly is informed that the General Committee decided to postpone to a later date its consideration of the inclusion of item 18 of the draft agenda, "Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte".</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">With respect to paragraph 60, the General Committee decided not to recommend the inclusion of item 158 of the draft agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">With regard to the proposal made by the Vice-Chairperson of the Third Committee concerning the consideration of the matters raised in the letter dated 26 November 2004 from the Chairman of the Third Committee to the President of the General Assembly of the fifty-ninth session, the General Committee decided to postpone to a later date consideration of the issues raised in that letter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">We turn now to the agenda which the General Committee recommends in paragraph 61 of its report for adoption by the General Assembly, taking into account the decisions just adopted on items 18, 39, 42, 74, 156 to 158 of the draft agenda, and concerning the letter of the Third Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">Bearing in mind that the agenda is now organized under nine headings, we shall consider the inclusion of items under each heading as a whole. I should like to remind members once again that, at present, we are not discussing the substance of any item.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">I give the floor to the representative of Solomon Islands.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Beck</span> <span class="nation">Solomon Islands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">My delegation wishes to refer to <a href="../pdf/A-60-250.pdf" class="pdf">document A/60/250</a> and to register its disappointment in the manner in which the General Committee discussed the issue of the agenda. Solomon Islands, among other countries, was actually denied the opportunity to debate the inclusion of certain items on the agenda, and feels that the United Nations must at least have a mechanism in place to provide for the full and equal participation of all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Rulings by the Chair to limit speakers on provisional agenda item 56 in the current working paper and item 60 denied the right of Member States to speak on the issue. In that regard, Solomon Islands feels that the principles of democracy and universality were not respected. Those principles should not be challenged, but rather protected and upheld. At times, my delegation feels, the Secretariat tends to dictate and impose on States, putting on paper rules that restrict countries from presenting their views, indirectly marginalizing them from the process that they should be part of.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">My delegation feels that, so long as we take such an approach, this Assembly will pick and choose which threats to discuss and which to sweep under the carpet. Solomon Islands hopes that the approach taken by the General Committee this year in discussing the two items must not and should not set a precedent for future General Committee working methods.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">I wish to close by assuring you, Sir, of Solomon Islands' continued support during your term in office.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The statement of the representative of Solomon Islands is duly noted.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">Referring to that very special situation, I want to make the point that, in view of the summit meeting, which was imminent at the time, the limitation of speakers was very much due to the enormous time pressures under which we were then working, with delegations on their way out to the airport and the very special conditions that existed before the summit. The limitation was the recommendation of the General Committee members, whom I am there to serve and chair.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">I thank the representative of Solomon Islands for the continued confidence that he expressed.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Items 1 to 3 and 8 have already been dealt with.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">We turn to items 4 to 7. May I take it that those items are included in the agenda?</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fal</span> <span class="nation">Gambia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">I want to make an intervention on the statement you just made, Sir, concerning the reason why item 42 of the provisional agenda was not included in the agenda of the sixtieth session. In that connection, I want to clarify the fact that the time constraint due to the High-level Plenary Meeting was the sole reason that debate on the two Taiwan-related issues was cut short. The limitations on the number of speakers, as well as on the time allocated to each statement as adopted by the General Committee on 13 September, should in no way set a precedent for future debates on those issues. The right of every State Member of the United Nations to raise issues of concern to the international community should therefore be recognized and reaffirmed.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">I want to call members' attention to the fact that the General Committee had actually decided to shorten the debate on the two proposals listed under items 42 and 158 in the provisional agenda regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk12">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. O'Brien</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk12-pa01">The United States will not participate in the adoption of this section of the report of the General Committee. We note that paragraph 66 (j) does not follow past practice in accurately reflecting what transpired in the Committee, and are pleased that a corrigendum has been issued.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk12-pa02">The United States will not support the adoption of this section because we do not agree with the allocation of the item on the International Criminal Court (ICC) directly to the plenary. If the General Assembly is to consider that technical legal item, it should do so in the Legal Committee, as it has for the past 15 years. To move the item to the plenary would be to ignore efforts to reform and rationalize the work of the General Assembly. That is the basis for our objection to the proposed allocation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk12-pa03">The International Court of Justice, established by the Charter as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, reports directly to the plenary, as do the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, established by the Security Council as subsidiary bodies of that principal organ. Unlike those judicial Tribunals, the International Criminal Court -- a treaty body to which many United Nations Members do not belong -- is neither a United Nations organ nor a subsidiary body. It is not appropriate for the ICC item to be sent directly to the plenary, and the United States will not support that recommendation by the General Committee.</p>
