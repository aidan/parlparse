All of those recommendations concern established practice, so rather than going through them one by one, I believe it would be better and more efficient that we address all of these organizational matters concerning the General Assembly as a whole.</div>

	Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa01">My delegation wishes to refer to document <a href="../pdf/A-60-250.pdf">A/60/250</a> and to register its disappointment in the manner in which the General Committee discussed the issue of the agenda. Solomon Islands, among other countries, was actually denied the opportunity to debate the inclusion of certain items on the agenda, and feels that the United Nations must at least have a mechanism in place to provide for the full and equal participation of all Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa02">Rulings by the Chair to limit speakers on provisional agenda item 56 in the current working paper and item 60 denied the right of Member States to speak on the issue. In that regard, Solomon Islands feels that the principles of democracy and universality were not respected. Those principles should not be challenged, but rather protected and upheld. At times, my delegation feels, the Secretariat tends to dictate and impose on States, putting on paper rules that restrict countries from presenting their views, indirectly marginalizing them from the process that they should be part of.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa03">My delegation feels that, so long as we take such an approach, this Assembly will pick and choose which threats to discuss and which to sweep under the carpet. Solomon Islands hopes that the approach taken by the General Committee this year in discussing the two items must not and should not set a precedent for future General Committee working methods.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk10-pa04">I wish to close by assuring you, Sir, of Solomon Islands' continued support during your term in office.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa02">Referring to that very special situation, I want to make the point that, in view of the summit meeting, which was imminent at the time, the limitation of speakers was very much due to the enormous time pressures under which we were then working, with delegations on their way out to the airport and the very special conditions that existed before the summit. The limitation was the recommendation of the General Committee members, whom I am there to serve and chair.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa03">I thank the representative of Solomon Islands for the continued confidence that he expressed.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa01">I want to make an intervention on the statement you just made, Sir, concerning the reason why item 42 of the provisional agenda was not included in the agenda of the sixtieth session. In that connection, I want to clarify the fact that the time constraint due to the High-level Plenary Meeting was the sole reason that debate on the two Taiwan-related issues was cut short. The limitations on the number of speakers, as well as on the time allocated to each statement as adopted by the General Committee on 13 September, should in no way set a precedent for future debates on those issues. The right of every State Member of the United Nations to raise issues of concern to the international community should therefore be recognized and reaffirmed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa02">I want to call members' attention to the fact that the General Committee had actually decided to shorten the debate on the two proposals listed under items 42 and 158 in the provisional agenda regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk12-pa01">The United States will not participate in the adoption of this section of the report of the General Committee.

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk12-pa02">The United States will not support the adoption of this section because we do not agree with the allocation of the item on the International Criminal Court (ICC) directly to the plenary. If the General Assembly is to consider that technical legal item, it should do so in the Legal Committee, as it has for the past 15 years. To move the item to the plenary would be to ignore efforts to reform and rationalize the work of the General Assembly. That is the basis for our objection to the proposed allocation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk12-pa03">The International Court of Justice, established by the Charter as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, reports directly to the plenary, as do the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, established by the Security Council as subsidiary bodies of that principal organ. Unlike those judicial Tribunals, the International Criminal Court -- a treaty body to which many United Nations Members do not belong -- is neither a United Nations organ nor a subsidiary body. It is not appropriate for the ICC item to be sent directly to the plenary, and the United States will not support that recommendation by the General Committee.</div>
