As stated in paragraph 17 of the Secretary-General's report, in recent years the closing date has been the Monday before the opening of the next session. Were the General Assembly to retain this practice, the closing date would consistently fall on an official holiday of the Organization, for which financial and other implications may need to be considered.

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk13-pa02">I had occasion to indicate to the General Committee the delicate nature of the matter now before this body for consideration. I raised the argument that the process of peacemaking in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is well under way and that the United Nations, the countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which your country, Sir, is a distinguished member, the Organization of African Unity and Member States signatory to the Lusaka ceasefire agreement have done a lot of work in order to enhance the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I argued that bringing this agenda item to the General Assembly would be shifting the crisis from the Great Lakes region to the General Assembly. I also argued that this matter is already before the International Court of Justice and that, as it is sub judice at The Hague, it should not be debated here. In addition to these arguments, I also raised procedural matters which I believe that the General Assembly should bear in mind before deciding on the inclusion of this item.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk13-pa03">I want to raise the issue of rules 14 and 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Rule 14 states that:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk13-pa04">"Any Member or principal organ of the United Nations or the Secretary-General may, at least thirty days before the date fixed for the opening of a regular session, request the inclusion of supplementary items in the agenda. Such items shall be placed on a supplementary list, which shall be</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg007-bk13-pa05">communicated to Members at least twenty days before the opening of the session."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk13-pa06">Rule 15 refers to additional items such as the one which the Democratic Republic of the Congo has requested to be included on the agenda. They made the request on 8 September -- this month. It was brought to the attention of the General Committee on 13 September, which is outside the time limit established by rule 14 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. I would like to raise the issue of rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly so that you, Sir, can make a ruling and give guidance. I can assure you, Sir, that I do not doubt your impartiality in this matter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk13-pa07">Rule 15 reads:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk13-pa08">"Additional items of an important and urgent character, proposed for inclusion in the agenda less than thirty days before the opening of a regular session or during a regular session, may be placed on the agenda if the General Assembly so decides by a majority of the members present and voting. No additional item may, unless the General Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, be considered until seven days have elapsed since it was placed on the agenda and until a committee has reported upon the question concerned."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk13-pa09">I want it to be on record for historical purposes that the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session would be violating its own rules of procedure if this agenda item were discussed at this session. I know that the General Assembly is sovereign in its own right, but it cannot be sovereign to the extent of overlooking its own rules.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa07">As regards some of the statements that were made by the representative of Rwanda, I would like to say the following. If peace were the objective of Rwanda, we would not have Rwandan soldiers reinforcing their positions and bringing in more troops and more guns to the central part of the Congo -- more specifically, to Kabinda and Mashala. The first of these is in Eastern Kasai and the second one is in Western Kasai.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk02-pa08">Rwanda signed the agreement in Lusaka on 10 July 1999. Rwanda made a commitment to respect the agreement it signed. Yet today we see that more guns, more troops are being brought to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So here I just want to --</div>
