	<div class="p">We now turn to section III of the report of the General Committee, which contains observations on the organization of future sessions of the General Assembly. In paragraph 43, the General Committee draws the attention of the General Assembly to paragraph 17 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241">resolution 51/241</a>, which states, <i>inter alia, </i>that the</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"plenary meetings of the General Assembly shall be formally opened every year on the first Tuesday following 1 September."</div>
	<div class="p">In this connection, the Committee also draws the attention of the Assembly to the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-241">resolution 51/241</a> (<a href="../pdf/A-52-855">A/52/855</a>), in particular to paragraphs 16 and 17, which highlight the subsequent action that needs to be taken and the difficulty that will be encountered in implementing that provision. As stated in paragraph 17 of the Secretary-General's report, in recent years the closing date has been the Monday before the opening of the next session. Were the General Assembly to retain this practice, the closing date would consistently fall on an official holiday of the Organization, for which financial and other implications may need to be considered. Paragraph 17 of the report further states that the General Assembly may wish to decide on a closing date for future sessions that will fall on a working day.</div>
	<div class="p">In paragraph 44, the General Committee, noting the ad hoc decisions that had to be taken by the General Assembly concerning the opening and/or closing dates of the fifty-second, fifty-third, fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth sessions, recommends to the Assembly that it address, during its fifty-fourth session, the question of the opening and closing dates of future regular sessions with a view to deciding on a formula to determine the opening and closing dates of future regular sessions.</div>
	<div class="p">In paragraph 45, the General Committee, taking into account the opening date of the regular sessions, also recommends to the Assembly a review of the question of the mandatory deadline for the submission to the Fifth Committee of all draft resolutions having programme budget implications.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly takes note of paragraph 43 and approves the recommendations contained in paragraphs 44 and 45?</div>

	Mr. Mutaboba (Rwanda)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the Assembly at this session.</div>
	<div class="p">I had occasion to indicate to the General Committee the delicate nature of the matter now before this body for consideration. I raised the argument that the process of peacemaking in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is well under way and that the United Nations, the countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), of which your country, Sir, is a distinguished member, the Organization of African Unity and Member States signatory to the Lusaka ceasefire agreement have done a lot of work in order to enhance the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I argued that bringing this agenda item to the General Assembly would be shifting the crisis from the Great Lakes region to the General Assembly. I also argued that this matter is already before the International Court of Justice and that, as it is sub judice at The Hague, it should not be debated here. In addition to these arguments, I also raised procedural matters which I believe that the General Assembly should bear in mind before deciding on the inclusion of this item.</div>
	<div class="p">I want to raise the issue of rules 14 and 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. Rule 14 states that:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Any Member or principal organ of the United Nations or the Secretary-General may, at least thirty days before the date fixed for the opening of a regular session, request the inclusion of supplementary items in the agenda. Such items shall be placed on a supplementary list, which shall be</div>
	<div class="blockquote">communicated to Members at least twenty days before the opening of the session."</div>
	<div class="p">Rule 15 refers to additional items such as the one which the Democratic Republic of the Congo has requested to be included on the agenda. They made the request on 8 September -- this month. It was brought to the attention of the General Committee on 13 September, which is outside the time limit established by rule 14 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. I would like to raise the issue of rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly so that you, Sir, can make a ruling and give guidance. I can assure you, Sir, that I do not doubt your impartiality in this matter.</div>
	<div class="blockquote">Rule 15 reads:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Additional items of an important and urgent character, proposed for inclusion in the agenda less than thirty days before the opening of a regular session or during a regular session, may be placed on the agenda if the General Assembly so decides by a majority of the members present and voting. No additional item may, unless the General Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, be considered until seven days have elapsed since it was placed on the agenda and until a committee has reported upon the question concerned."</div>
	<div class="p">I want it to be on record for historical purposes that the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session would be violating its own rules of procedure if this agenda item were discussed at this session. I know that the General Assembly is sovereign in its own right, but it cannot be sovereign to the extent of overlooking its own rules.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The President:</b> I would like to remind the representative of Rwanda that on the last day of the fifty-third session, on 13 September 1999, the General Assembly decided to include this item on the provisional agenda of the fifty-fourth session. Therefore rules 14 and 15 of the rules of procedure do not apply to the consideration of the question of the inclusion of this item. For members' information, rule 13 (c) governs the inclusion of this item in the provisional agenda. Rule 13 (c) is the rule that is applicable in this case.</div>

	<div class="p">I would first like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to lead the work of the General Assembly during its fifty-fourth session.</div>
	<div class="p">I am not going to be long. I am just going to raise some of the concerns that we have with regard to what has been said by the representative of Rwanda. The first thing I would say is that the item was debated last year by the General Assembly despite the fact that the Security Council was considering or was dealing with this issue. And this year the General Committee met and agreed to include the item on the agenda. Now the item has already been adopted by the General Committee, and I would like to remind the Assembly of a rule that is very important: rule 22, which I am going to read in French since this is the only copy I have of the rules of procedure.</div>
	<div class="p">(<i>spoke in French</i>)</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"Items on the agenda may be amended or deleted by the General Assembly by a majority of the members present and voting."</div>
	<div class="p">(<i>spoke in English</i>)</div>
	<div class="p">The item has already been adopted by the General Committee. For us to reject it would require engaging in another debate in which arguments and counter-arguments would have to be presented. This would certainly be time-consuming.</div>
	<div class="p">As regards some of the statements that were made by the representative of Rwanda, I would like to say the following. If peace were the objective of Rwanda, we would not have Rwandan soldiers reinforcing their positions and bringing in more troops and more guns to the central part of the Congo -- more specifically, to Kabinda and Mashala. The first of these is in Eastern Kasai and the second one is in Western Kasai.</div>
	<div class="p">Rwanda signed the agreement in Lusaka on 10 July 1999. Rwanda made a commitment to respect the agreement it signed. Yet today we see that more guns, more troops are being brought to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So here I just want to --</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The President: </b>I request the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo not to deal with the substance of the item. We are discussing its inclusion on the agenda, not the substance. Refrain from going back to the substance of the issue. We are talking about inclusion, and I have read out the relevant rule applicable in this case -- rule 13 (c).</div>

	<div class="p">I hope that the Main Committees will continue the effort they demonstrated in the fifty-third session in concluding their work on time.</div>
