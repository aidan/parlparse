	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-1995-1.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/1</a>, containing the position paper of the Secretary-General on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, entitled "Supplement to An Agenda for Peace". Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's position paper entitled Supplement to An Agenda for Peace' (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-1.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/1</a>) as an important contribution to the debate on the development of the United Nations activities related to international peace and security in all its aspects at the beginning of the year in which the Organization celebrates its Fiftieth Anniversary. The Council notes that the paper contains a wide range of conclusions and recommendations with regard to instruments for resolving conflict. The Council is of the view that in the light of recent developments and experience gained, efforts should be made to further enhance the Organization's ability to perform the tasks laid down for it under the Charter. The Council reiterates that, in performing the above-mentioned tasks, the purposes and principles of the Charter should always be strictly observed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes and shares the priority given by the Secretary-General to action to prevent conflict. It encourages all Member States to make the fullest possible use of instruments of preventive action, including the Secretary-General's good offices, the dispatch of special envoys of the Secretary-General and the deployment, with the consent as appropriate of the host country or countries, of small field missions for preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. The Council believes that adequate resources must be made available within the United Nations system for these actions. It notes the problem identified by the Secretary-General in finding senior persons to act as his special representative or special envoy and encourages Member States which have not yet done so to provide the Secretary-General with the names of persons who might be considered by him for such posts, together with other resources both human and material which might be useful to such missions. It encourages the Secretary-General to make full use of resources thus put at his disposal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council endorses the view expressed by the Secretary-General concerning the crucial importance of economic and social development as a secure basis for lasting peace. Social and economic development can be as valuable in preventing conflicts as in healing the wounds after conflicts have occurred. The Council urges States to support the efforts of the United Nations system with regard to preventive and post-conflict peace-building activities and, in this context, to provide necessary assistance for the economic and social development of countries, especially those which have suffered or are suffering from conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's analysis regarding peace-keeping operations. It recalls the statement made by its President on 3 May 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-22.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/22</a>) which, <i>inter alia</i>, listed factors to be taken into account in establishing peace-keeping operations. It notes that in resolving conflicts, primary emphasis should continue to be placed on the use of peaceful means rather than force. Without prejudice to its ability to respond to situations on a case-by-case basis, and rapidly and flexibly as the circumstances require, it reiterates the principles of consent of the parties, impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defence. It underlines the need to conduct peace-keeping operations with a clearly defined mandate, command structure, time-frame and secure financing, in support of efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to a conflict: it stresses the importance of the consistent application of these principles to the establishment and conduct of all peace-keeping operations. It stresses the importance it attaches to the provision of the fullest possible information to the Council to assist it in making decisions regarding the mandate, duration and termination of current operations. It also emphasizes the importance of providing troop contributors with the fullest possible information.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council shares the Secretary-General's concern regarding the availability of troops and equipment for peace-keeping operations. It recalls earlier statements by the President of the Council on the subject and reiterates the importance of improving the capacity of the United Nations for rapid deployment and reinforcement of operations. To that end, it encourages the Secretary-General to continue his study of options aimed at improving the capacity for such rapid deployment and reinforcement. The Council believes that the first priority in improving the capacity for rapid deployment should be the further enhancement of the existing stand-by arrangements, covering the full spectrum of resources, including arrangements for lift and headquarters capabilities, required to mount and execute peace-keeping operations. It strongly encourages the Secretary-General to take further steps in this regard, including the establishment of a comprehensive database to cover civilian as well as military resources. In this context, it considers that particular attention should be given to the greatest possible interoperability between elements identified in such arrangements. The Council reiterates its call to Member States not already doing so to participate in the stand-by arrangements. While affirming the principle that contributing Governments should ensure that their troops arrive with all the equipment needed to be fully operational, the Council also encourages the Secretary-General and Member States to continue to consider means, whether in the context of stand-by arrangements or more broadly, to address the requirements of contingents which may need additional equipment or training.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council strongly supports the Secretary-General's conclusion that peace-keeping operations need an effective information capacity, and his intention to address this requirement in future peace-keeping operations from the planning stage.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's ideas regarding post-conflict peace-building. It agrees that an appropriately strong overall United Nations contribution needs to be sustained after the successful conclusion of a peace-keeping operation, and encourages the Secretary-General to study ways and means of ensuring effective coordination between the United Nations and other agencies involved in post-conflict peace-building, and to take active steps to ensure that such coordination takes place in the immediate aftermath of a peace-keeping operation. The measures described by the Secretary-General may also be required, with the consent of the State or States concerned, after successful preventive action and in other cases where an actual peace-keeping deployment does not take place.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council shares the Secretary-General's assessment of the paramount importance of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Such proliferation is a threat to international peace and security. Appropriate measures will be taken in this respect in particular where international treaties provide for recourse to the Council when their provisions are violated. The Council underlines the need for all States to fulfil their obligations in respect of arms control and disarmament, in particular in regard to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council takes note of the assessment of the Secretary-General of the importance of micro-disarmament', as described in his paper, in the solution of conflicts with which the United Nations is currently dealing and of his view that small arms are probably responsible for most of the deaths in these conflicts. It shares the concern of the Secretary-General at the negative consequences for international peace and security which often arise from the illicit traffic in conventional weapons, including small arms, and takes note of his view that the search for effective solutions to this problem should begin now. In this context the Council stresses the vital importance of the strict implementation of existing arms embargo regimes. It welcomes and supports efforts with regard to international measures to curb the spread of anti-personnel land-mines and to deal with the land-mines already laid, and in this regard welcomes <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-75.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolutions 49/75</a> D of 15 December 1994 and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-215.pdf" class="pdf">49/215</a> of 23 December 1994. It reaffirms its deep concern over the tremendous humanitarian problems caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices to the populations of mine-infested countries and emphasizes the need for an increase in mine-clearing efforts by the countries concerned and with the assistance of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council stresses the importance it attaches to the effective implementation of all measures taken by it to maintain or restore international peace and security including economic sanctions. It agrees that the object of economic sanctions is not to punish but to modify the behaviour of the country or party which represents a threat to international peace and security. The steps demanded of that country or party should be clearly defined in Council resolutions, and the sanctions regime in question should be subject to periodic review and it should be lifted when the objectives of the appropriate provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions are achieved. The Council remains concerned that, within this framework, appropriate measures are taken to ensure that humanitarian supplies reach affected populations and appropriate consideration is given to submissions received from neighbouring or other States affected by special economic problems as a result of the imposition of sanctions. The Council urges the Secretary-General, when considering the allocation of resources available to him within the Secretariat, to take appropriate steps to reinforce those sections of the Secretariat dealing directly with sanctions and their various aspects so as to ensure that all these matters are addressed in as effective, consistent and timely a manner as possible. It welcomes the Secretary-General's efforts to study ways and means of addressing the various aspects related to sanctions in his report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance it attaches to the role that regional organizations and arrangements can play in helping to maintain international peace and security. It underlines the need for effective coordination between their efforts and those of the United Nations in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter. It recognizes that the responsibilities and capacities of different regional organizations and arrangements vary, as well as the readiness and competence of regional organizations and arrangements, as reflected in their charters and other relevant documents, to participate in efforts to maintain international peace and security. It welcomes the Secretary-General's willingness to assist regional organizations and arrangements as appropriate in developing a capacity for preventive action, peacemaking and, where appropriate, peace-keeping. It draws particular attention in this regard to the needs of Africa. It encourages the Secretary-General and Member States to continue to consider ways and means of improving practical cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and regional organizations and arrangements in these areas. The Council encourages the Secretary-General to continue the practice of meetings on cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"The Security Council recognizes the crucial importance of the availability of the necessary financial resources both for preventive action and operations undertaken to sustain international peace and security. It therefore urges Member States to honour their financial obligations to the United Nations. At the same time, the Council emphasizes the continuing necessity for careful control of peace-keeping costs and for the most efficient possible use of peace-keeping funds and other financial resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">"The Security Council will keep the Secretary-General's paper under consideration. The Council invites all interested Member States to present further reflections on United Nations peace-keeping operations, and in particular on ways and means to improve the capacity of the United Nations for rapid deployment. It invites the Secretary-General to keep it closely informed of the action he takes in follow-up to the paper and to the present statement. It hopes that the General Assembly, as well as other organizations and entities, will give consideration of the paper a high degree of priority and will take decisions on those matters which fall within their direct responsibility."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-9.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/9</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
