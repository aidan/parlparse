<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="non-nation">Chairman of the Security Council Committee</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">It is a pleasure for me to address the Council in my capacity as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">At today's meeting, I will address three important issues. First of all, I should like to inform the Council about the work done by the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) during the last three months of the past year. Secondly, I should like to point out the principal themes of the tenth programme of work for the current trimester. And, last but not least, I wish to share with the Council the main aspects of the CTC's report of 19 February on its own revitalization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Before I begin, however, I would like to say that, as members are aware, it is customary to hold this kind of meeting every three months, but that, at the request of several members of the CTC, the meeting was delayed because it was believed that it would be preferable for the report on revitalization to be ready when I addressed the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Let me begin with the CTC's work during October, November and December 2003. In the Committee's ninth working programme, we stated that we would complete the review of 70 reports from Member States and others on their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The CTC has approved 44 reports and its sub-committees have reviewed and considered 37 reports. Secondly, we will continue to circulate the matrix on a monthly basis, with a view to identifying assistance needs and offers, which we have done. Thirdly, we will continue to update the Counter-Terrorism Committee web site, which we have also done. Fourthly, we will send to the Security Council the list of States that submit their reports late, which I, as Chairman of the CTC, have done.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Last but not least, the ninth working programme also contains the commitment of the Chairman to submit a report by 15 November on the problems encountered by States and the CTC itself in implementing the important <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The report from the Chair was sent to the Security Council on 14 November and takes into account the opinions expressed by the members of the Committee, describing the main problems encountered and the challenges to be met for the proper and full compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by States, the effective operation of the CTC itself and the strengthening of the Security Council with respect to the implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Another important aspect of our work is that we have continued to expand our contacts and cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations, as outlined in the action plan agreed by the Committee. The Committee has continued to encourage and participate in meetings between international and regional organizations, such as that which took place in Washington, D.C., on 7 October, organized by the Organization of American States and its Inter-American Committee against Terrorism. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the work of the Organization of American States and its Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The Washington, D.C., meeting reaffirmed the commitment of all participants to pursuing further coordination among their programmes in order to avoid duplication and better to assist States in their efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The next follow-up meeting is scheduled for next week, 11 and 12 March, in Vienna and will be hosted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. At the same time, I have continued sending letters to various international organizations suggesting the specific areas in which such cooperation can be strengthened.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">In pursuit of this policy during the period I have referred to, I undertook a trip to strengthen the Committee's connections to various organizations headquartered in Europe. Over the course of four days, I visited four capitals and met with eight organizations. I met in Paris with the Counter-Terrorism Action Group of the G8 and, in Vienna, with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In Brussels, I pursued contacts with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union Working Party on Terrorism and the World Customs Organization. Finally, I met in Strasbourg with the Council of Europe. In every one of those meetings, we explored better ways to increase cooperation between the CTC and those organizations and to improve coordination with their programmes in the fight against terrorism, with the principal aim of avoiding overlapping.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">As to the second issue, the main lines of the CTC's current working programme are as follows. The Committee will continue to study Member States' reports on their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It has also been established that the CTC will approve a report on the measures to be taken to tackle the problems identified in its 14 November report. This touches on the third issue, which I will address later.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">It is also important that we review the conclusions of next week's meeting between international and regional organizations in Vienna. In this regard, I am pleased to announce that we are preparing a final joint declaration to be signed by all participants, which will include concrete ways to enhance our work in the fight against terrorism and which will announce the establishment of a joint assistance matrix that will be the responsibility of the CTC and would give States and international organizations alike an overall picture and a practical tool for making better use of the technical assistance programmes available.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">Thirdly, and no less important, I wish to comment on the main aspects of the 19 February report of the CTC on its own revitalization, which has been circulated today as a public document of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">First of all, it is relevant to stress that the idea behind the revitalization of the CTC has its origin in a dual conviction -- first, that terrorism is one of the majors threats to international peace and security, and secondly, that the United Nations must continue to play the lead role in the fight against that threat and that the role of the Security Council, through the CTC, must be maintained and reinforced. The goal of the revitalization is therefore to provide the CTC with the means to become more operational, more proactive and more visible. The revitalization of the Committee is urgent and absolutely necessary to strengthen the fight against terrorism by giving the CTC further means to fulfil its mandate of monitoring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The report from the Chair, approved on 14 November, shows that the current procedures and structures of the CTC must be reconsidered. That is particularly true given that the CTC has evolved to assume a more proactive role in the dialogue with Member States, in evaluating the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, in facilitating technical assistance to Member States and in promoting closer cooperation with regional and subregional organizations. All those challenges make it imperative to revitalize the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">The revitalization described in the 19 February report gives the CTC the appropriate means to fulfil its task within the existing United Nations structure. It is also useful to point out the main goals of the revitalization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">First, we must step up our efforts to promote and monitor the implementation of all aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> through dialogue on the basis of its guiding principles of cooperation, transparency and even-handedness.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">Secondly, we must strengthen the facilitation of technical assistance to States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">Thirdly, we must strengthen the contacts and coordination with other United Nations bodies and enhance cooperation and coordination among international and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Fourthly, we must improve the capacity to collect information on the efforts of Member States and to facilitate the provision of appropriate technical assistance, including visits on the ground, always with the approval of the State concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">Fifthly, we must improve the Committee's capacity to make practical and concrete recommendations to the Security Council in all areas related to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">Sixthly and finally, we must expedite our work and simplify procedures, adopt a proactive communication strategy and develop and maintain a high degree of capacity in all areas relevant to the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">On the basis of those criteria, we have agreed that the proposal for the new structure should be as follows. The revitalized Committee will maintain the current structure: the plenary, composed of Security Council member States, and the Bureau, composed of the chair and the vice-chairs. As an important addition, a Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate will be created, under which the current staff of experts and Secretariat personnel will be reorganized.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">The plenary will focus on policy and strategic decisions, while the Directorate will be the executive branch of the CTC and will be part of the Secretariat. The staff of the new Directorate will be assigned to a technical assistance and assessment office and an information and administration office. To ensure the necessary financial responsibility, the Committee's financial resources will be subject, obviously, to United Nations rules and regulations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">It is important to emphasize the main features of this revitalization. First, it is consistent with Security Council practice under the Charter and United Nations rules and regulations. Secondly, it will not be a permanent structure and will not set a precedent for other Security Council bodies. We have agreed to establish a sunset clause for 31 December 2007, under which the Directorate will continue to exist only if the Security Council so decides. For full implementation of the revitalization, we need a Security Council resolution one which, I stress, will not modify <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> or other existing relevant resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">In the work before us, I appeal to all representatives of Member States to continue and strengthen their support, which is needed to fight terrorism. The battle against this scourge, which, I repeat -- it is not a cliché -- is one of the greatest threats to peace and security in our time, cannot be won without the full commitment and conviction of the United Nations and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa25">To this day, the Counter-Terrorism Committee is the only comprehensive and general instrument within the United Nations to help Member States implement the measures contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>; that is why we must strengthen it. In the words of the Secretary-General, "The work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the cooperation it has received from Member States have been unprecedented and exemplary" (<i><a href="../html/S-PV-4453.html">S/PV.4453</a>, p. 2</i>). To maintain that state of affairs and to be effective, the Committee must be revitalized.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank Ambassador Arias for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the full texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aho-Glele</span> <span class="nation">Benin</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">This public meeting enables us to assess the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and to discuss the paths to follow and the means to employ to make the international community's fight against the scourge of terrorism more effective. The odious attacks of 11 September 2001 revealed, by their magnitude and their cruelty, the gravity of the threat and the challenge that terrorism poses to international peace and security. The threat of terrorism has increased considerably with the possibility that terrorist organizations have access to weapons of mass destruction, which cause us to fear the worst for humanity.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">There is real consensus among States on the need to fight terrorism through concerted action within the framework of multilateral cooperation. The United Nations has played the leading role as the best framework for coordinating the efforts of Member States. By shouldering its statutory responsibilities, the Security Council has rightly taken the lead in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">In the light of the resolve of States to pool their efforts to stem the threat of terrorism, the Security Council has given specific content to this fight by defining the main guidelines for a coherent strategy to destroy the underpinnings of the apparatus of terrorism and to break the links that feed its worldwide network. In that context, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a fundamental reference, in that it formulated clear measures to guide the conduct of States and to provide the international community with an appropriate instrument to guide the implementation of the strategy adopted. That instrument, the Counter-Terrorism Committee, has proved its worth. The CTC has built international solidarity in the face of the terrorist threat, both at the State level and at the level of international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The need to strengthen the CTC's means of action to enable it to deal more effectively with this threat has prompted Council member States to draft an important revitalization plan. The Chairman of the Committee has just outlined it very clearly, for which we thank him. The proposal includes innovations that must be proved in practice. We endorse the objectives assigned to the Executive Directorate, which must be part of the Secretariat, in conformity with the Charter. We urge Member States to support the Directorate when it is established, because all States have an interest in making the world in which we live a safer and better place.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">That said, the fight against terrorism should not make us lose sight of the factors from which terrorism derives its pretext and which it uses to justify itself. Among those factors -- which are numerous -- my delegation would highlight the clash among civilizations, which must be overcome by promoting cultural diversity and a dialogue among cultures. Other factors are extreme poverty and the injustice of the current international economic system, which dooms the majority of humanity to destitution and disease. In addition, there is the persistence of the Palestinian conflict, which has been going on for more than half a century. We also note the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which is a factor in the destabilization of entire regions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">As it mobilizes against terrorism, the international community would gain in credibility if it consistently implemented the Millennium Declaration and the outcomes of the major conferences held under United Nations auspices -- particularly the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries, to prevent an increase in the number of so-called failed States, which easily fall prey to mafia networks of all kinds. Such an approach would help to improve the climate of current international relations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank Ambassador Arias for his excellent briefing and for his efforts to enable the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to fully carry out its mission. I would also like to thank him, as well as the other members of the CTC, for the reports of 14 November 2003 and 19 February 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-70.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/70</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>) on the revitalization of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I would like to point out that in the report of 14 November 2003 the Chairman of the CTC clearly identified both the difficulties encountered by States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and those linked to the operation of that body. The difficulties have become so serious that if they are not quickly remedied, they could compromise the operation of the CTC in the long term. That is why my delegation cannot but provide its support to any effort to instil a new dynamic in the work of the CTC. After more than two years of existence and having made convincing progress, the Committee seems to have reached it limits and to be running out of steam. That can be overcome only if we renew our political will and our collective determination to combat the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">My delegation therefore reaffirms its firm commitment to combat terrorism and to support the proposals to revitalize the CTC, in particular through rationalizing its work and setting up new administrative and budgetary arrangements. In fact, we believe it is urgent to "debureaucratize" the Committee's structure in order to give it more flexibility in carrying out its work, by means of an executive body that would take care of the daily tasks, including procedural matters, in order to enable the plenary body to devote itself efficiently to strategic and policy matters. The establishment and operation of such a body must be done, as much as possible, with full respect for the rules and procedures of our Organization and in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">In supporting the efforts underway to revitalize the CTC, we would like to stress that since terrorism is now recognized as a threat to international peace and security, the struggle against it warrants special treatment. In that respect, besides not sparing any effort to fully implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, on the basis of possible subsequent developments, we must also begin a thorough discussion aimed at the extension of the CTC mandate beyond what was conferred upon it by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">I would like to take the opportunity offered by this debate on the revitalization of the CTC to recall three proposals submitted by my Government to the Security Council bodies charged with the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The first proposal addresses the right of asylum. In that respect, we believe that countries that have a strong tradition of granting asylum, where terrorist networks have developed that now threaten their own security, should urgently review their procedures for granting asylum and should inquire, in particular, of the countries of origin of the asylum seekers concerning their status.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">The second proposal addresses the monitoring of funds belonging to individuals, entities or organizations that are suspected of being sources of funding for terrorist groups, which monitoring should be done in a more rigorous manner. Here I stress the particular responsibility of financial institutions and banks, with a view to more strictly controlling movements of capital that are suspected of being linked to acts of terrorism. I would like to recall that, besides its legal and regulatory arsenal for fighting violations in the area of currency exchange and capital movements, Algeria has set up a unit on handling financial information, an independent structure under the Ministry of Finance, whose primary mission is to combat the financing of terrorism and money-laundering</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Lastly, with respect to international cooperation against terrorism, my delegation, would like to call for the fulfilment of a proposal that we consider extremely important, that of setting up an international fund to support the fight against terrorism. It would provide multifaceted aid to developing countries to help them adapt and harmonize their national legislation and help with technical assistance and with the acquisition of necessary equipment for an effective global response to terrorism. We are especially convinced of the relevance of that proposal since, of the 58 countries that were indicated by the CTC Chairman in October 2003 as being late in submitting their reports the great majority belong to the developing world.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">The threats that terrorism poses to international peace and security are not limited or isolated, but are increasingly interconnected and transnational in nature. Hence, we need to adopt an integrated and global approach that would take into account the political, diplomatic and operational dimensions, including international judicial cooperation and cooperation in the exchange of information and the acquisition of specific equipment for the fight against terrorism. We believe that the CTC must evolve in order to take control of that package of multifaceted relations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">Furthermore, the fight against terrorism must be part of a coordinated scheme for establishing a new system of collective security based on the principle of the indivisibility of security and on the now well-established link between development and security.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">Lastly, I would like to conclude by congratulating Ambassador Arias, as well as the other members of the CTC, for their satisfactory performance in carrying out the work programme of the last three months and to support them in implementing the work programme for the current three months. We hope the Security Council can very soon adopt a resolution that sanctions the main points of the CTC report on revitalization.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">First, I would like to thank Ambassador Arias for the information he has given us on the work of the last few months, and the proposals agreed to in the Committee on its reform.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) remains an important instrument in pooling and coordinating international efforts in the fight against the global threat of terrorism and in implementing the tasks set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The constructive nature and mutual understanding that characterizes the work of the CTC and its relation with all the Member States of the United Nations are an important positive factor for maintaining unity and for providing for the Committee's effectiveness. The CTC has consistently continued its policy to create security mechanisms to meet the new demands of the counter-terrorism fight. Despite the difficulties, the process whereby States adopt contemporary anti-terrorism legislation in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is becoming more effective.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">An important positive outcome of the CTC's work is the significant momentum generated by the universalizing of the 12 anti-terrorism conventions, which is definitely helping to improve the international legal basis for countering terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The mechanism being established for close, regular interaction between the CTC and international, regional and subregional organizations is acquiring particular importance. We hope that the upcoming third meeting to be held in Vienna on 11 and 12 March 2004 between those organizations and the CTC will lend additional impetus to the regional dimension of the Committee's work and will help to increase the concrete contributions of all cooperating organizations to carry out a global anti-terrorism strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">At the same time, we cannot ignore the real problems that have faced the CTC recently. Right now, the Committee is moving on to a new stage in its work, central to which are the practical activities of States in counter-terrorism, in keeping with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. This in and of itself presents the CTC with essentially new and important tasks. It is clear that the multifaceted nature of the international counter-terrorism agenda and the expansion of the geographical area of terrorist activities -- which encompass, inter alia, countries that do not yet have sufficient potential or resources to avert specific terrorist threats -- increase many times the demands on the future work of the CTC. We welcome the fact that the Committee has adopted a responsible approach and has promptly realized the need to adapt to these new conditions. It has conducted a thorough analysis of the main problems confronting countries in carrying out their counter-terrorism tasks and of the difficulties in the work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">All of this has been reflected in the report of the Chairman of the Committee (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex). In order to resolve the problems enumerated in the report, a structural reorganization of this subsidiary body of the Security Council and a strengthening of its expert and organizational capacities are of particular importance. We support the proposals of the CTC to revitalize and reactivate its work. We deem timely the creation of a CTC Executive Directorate, which could become an important instrument for providing effective operational support to the CTC in its future work and in carrying out its tasks as defined by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">We wish to actively work on a draft resolution on the basis of the proposals contained in the 19 February report of the Chairman of the CTC. We are sure that, given the new conditions, this will help the Committee successfully carry out the functions entrusted to it as the key coordinator in the fight against terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Negroponte</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I would like to join other members in thanking Ambassador Arias for his report to us this morning and to also congratulate him for the work that he has done as the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) over the months.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Perhaps the most significant contribution by the Security Council to the global campaign against terrorism has been the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which established the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Through its capacity-building and global coordination initiatives, the Committee has become a significant element of the worldwide campaign against terrorism. It has helped energize States and organizations around the world to pay more attention to combating terrorism, whether through the adoption of new -- or the improvement of existing -- counter-terrorism legislation or the development and implementation of counter-terrorism action plans. While the Committee has performed admirably, much work remains to be done.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">In the two and a half years since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, despite the global counter-terrorism effort, the terrorists and their supporters have continued to strike, whether in Bali, Moscow, Casablanca, Riyadh, Baghdad, Istanbul, Haifa, Jerusalem, Karbala, Quetta or elsewhere. Terrorism has continued to spread, raising the spectre of further deadly attacks on innocent victims and continuing threats to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">The Security Council must remain at the forefront of the international community's campaign to rid the world of the scourge of terrorism. To do so, it must act with a renewed sense of urgency and a commitment to a sustained and determined effort to defeat this global scourge. It must act as though 11 September took place yesterday, not more than two years ago. It must not wait for the next major terrorist act to occur to become energized. The Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee must never forget that, as long as a few States are not acting quickly enough to raise their capacity to fight terrorism, we all remain vulnerable.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The Committee has initially responded to the challenge. It has identified not only the difficulties States are having in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, but it has also highlighted its own internal structural problems that are preventing it from performing more effectively. It must continue to innovate and evolve.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">After months of deliberations, the Committee has agreed that restructuring its support staff is needed to enable the Committee to carry out all of the current and new tasks in its approved work programme, particularly in the facilitation of technical assistance and coordination among international, regional and subregional organizations. The proposal presented by Chairman Arias not only reflects the views of all 15 Committee members, but also takes into account detailed discussions with the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Once the proposed restructuring becomes a reality, the CTC can become more effective in fulfilling its mandate of monitoring States' efforts to implement all of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It will be able to work more closely with States in identifying gaps in their counter-terrorism capabilities and in finding the necessary technical assistance to fill those gaps. In addition, it will expand its efforts to galvanize organizations worldwide to adopt and implement best practices, codes and standards and to ensure that their members are implementing the requirements of the resolution. Of course, it will do this while respecting what have become its hallmarks: transparency, cooperation and even-handedness.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Finding innovative ways to address the ongoing threat to international peace and security posed by terrorism presents the Council with a unique challenge. The Council must not become complacent in this search. It must continue to explore ways to enhance its contribution in this area. The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the creation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee were central elements of the Council's extraordinary response to this unique situation. We view the CTC's restructuring proposal as a continuation of that response and as a managerial reform after the experience of 30 months of work. The CTC has fulfilled its responsibility by studying the problem and proposing the solution. The Council must now do its part and take the necessary action to make the proposal a reality.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I would like to congratulate Ambassador Arias and to thank him for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex) and for his stewardship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. I would like to associate myself with the remarks to be made subsequently by Ambassador Ryan on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">I take this occasion to offer condolences to the families of all those killed or injured in recent terrorist attacks, from Baghdad to Karbala, from Quetta to Moscow and in the Middle East, to name but a few. There is a long list. Those chilling attacks are a sobering reminder of why we are here this morning, having this discussion. Those attacks show that terrorists know no boundaries; they do not distinguish between race, religion or geography, and they are united in their disdain for life. That is a risk that affects us all, and we need to face it together.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The fight against terrorism needs to be sustained, effective and efficient. Combating and defeating terrorism requires concerted and wide-ranging action. Military action may be necessary. Better intelligence is required; defensive systems need to be improved; some organizations need to be proscribed; and we have to tackle the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Financial flows to terrorists have to be cut off. Perhaps, above all, we need to do better in tackling the resentments that encourage terrorism, but can never justify it. That is why we need a multilateral response, and why the United Nations and its agencies have a key role. Today we are addressing part of that role: the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">In our view, the Committee has been successful in four main ways: by maintaining unity; by establishing and delivering momentum; by establishing accountability; and by providing guidance to Member States. In terms of unity, the Committee has helped to ensure that Member States and the international community have remained united and worked together. Momentum has been established by keeping terrorism high on the international agenda. The accountability stems from the way in which the Committee has examined Member States' domestic legislation and practice, helping to identify weaknesses and gaps. Lastly, it has provided guidance through a system to facilitate the provision of technical assistance to Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">But there is no room for complacency. As the representative of Algeria said earlier, we now need a new dynamic. It is essential that the Committee be strengthened and given the support it needs to help Member States to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The United Kingdom therefore very much welcomes the proposal for the revitalization of the Committee. That proposal will, in our view, give greater focus to long-term goals. It will help the Committee to adopt a more proactive communications strategy, and the Committee's expertise will be enhanced and properly coordinated.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">The goal is simple. It is to help Member States implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and ratify the United Nations counter-terrorism conventions. That would retain accountability, while providing greater guidance on the complex range of issues which have emerged since the Committee was first established.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">But the proposals should not be misinterpreted. They are simply a means to enhance and reorganize the support structure of the Committee to help it better achieve its objectives -- objectives which we are all signed up to. It is not about change for the sake of it, and the proposals specifically do not seek to alter the structure of the United Nations or to undermine the Secretariat. In its deliberations, the CTC has taken care to ensure that the revitalization is consistent with United Nations rules and regulations and with previous Security Council practices. As the representative of the United States emphasized, the proposals have been discussed at length, and thoroughly, with the representatives of the Secretariat, whose views have been taken into account.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">I have a very simple vision of the proposed Directorate. It will work with and for the Committee. It will offer guidance and help to implement the Committee's wishes. Does that mean a degree of responsibility to the Committee? Yes. Does it mean that, in policy terms, the Committee will be directing the work of the Directorate? Yes. In the view of the United Kingdom, anything less would run counter to any sensible delineation of responsibilities and would undermine the efficiency of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Let me stress that the overall substance and working methods of the CTC would remain unchanged. The Committee would retain the hallmarks that have contributed so much to its success: cooperation, transparency and even-handedness. The Committee's mandate -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- would remain unchanged. The new structure is not intended to be permanent. There will be a comprehensive review by 31 December 2005, and a completion date of 31 December 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">If terrorists are indefatigable in their endeavours, then the United Nations and the Security Council must match them. The Committee must be given the means to continue and sustain the fight against terrorism, to maintain the unity, momentum and accountability which have been created and to provide guidance to Member States to enable them to comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">The United Kingdom urges all Member States to be supportive of the revitalization proposals, because they can contribute in no small measure to a more effective effort to actually make the world a safer and more stable place.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valle</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I would like to express my appreciation to you, Mr. President, for having convened this important meeting. The oral reports of the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and the presentation of the Committee's quarterly programmes of work are opportunities for the membership of the Organization as a whole to be informed of the relevant work being carried out by the CTC in the fight against terrorism. This meeting acquires particular relevance, as the Security Council will shortly be taking up the question of the reform of the CTC. The open debate convened today provides an excellent opportunity for learning what the broad membership of the Organization has to say about an issue of such magnitude.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">I would like to commend Ambassador Inocencio Arias, not only for his work as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, but also for his efforts in promoting the proposal for the reform of the Committee. Without his determined commitment, it is unlikely that we would be in a position to discuss a concrete proposal for reform. We further extend thanks for his comprehensive presentation on the work of the Committee in the last quarter of 2003 and on the programme of work for the current trimester. The main issue in this debate, however, will undoubtedly be the proposal for the reform of the Committee. In this regard, I fully associate my country with the statement to be delivered later by the Permanent Representative of Argentina on behalf of the Rio Group. I would like to add a few remarks in our national capacity regarding the main issues involved in the creation of a new structure for the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">To begin with, the Brazilian Constitution provides that our foreign policy should be guided by the repudiation of terrorism in all its forms. Therefore, Brazil has signed all the relevant conventions and international instruments in the field of combating international terrorism, and actively participates in negotiations and initiatives on the subject.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">The first issue to be addressed is the creation of the new structure itself. The purpose of the report presented to the Council (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex) is the restructuring of the Committee in order to correct possible imbalances in its current structure and to allow for a refocusing of the work of the CTC in coordinating the capacity-building efforts of Member States in the fight against terrorism. The main proposal to that end is the creation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. As pointed out in the report, the mandate of the Counter-Terrorism Committee remains as defined in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the subsequent ministerial declarations of the Council annexed to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1377(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1377 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1456 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">As the Council considers the issue of the reform, it is of particular importance that the alterations proposed to revamp the Counter-Terrorism Committee be strictly of a procedural and operational nature, and that the decisions adopted in this regard be consistent with such an approach. The Brazilian Government understands that the fight against terrorism must be carried out in strict accordance with international law, in particular the commitments assumed in the area of human rights and humanitarian law. The preservation of the rule of law, of individual liberties and of democratic principles and values is, itself, one of the main objectives in the struggle against terror. Any concession in this regard would clearly benefit those who, through their dastardly acts of terrorism, show nothing but contempt for human life.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">The second point I would like to highlight is the proposal for the appointment of an Executive Director. The creation of that post addresses main areas of concern. It allows for a better coordination of work within the executive structure of the Committee itself and better interaction between that structure and the Committee, more precisely, the Member States represented in it. During negotiations on the report, Brazil attached priority to clearly establishing the duties of the Executive Director in terms of reporting and informing the Committee on the work of the Directorate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">The appointment of an Executive Director will also allow for better coordination of work with other bodies -- in particular the 1267 Committee of the Security Council and the relevant branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, to name only two -- resulting in the multiplication of synergies and a greater capacity to offer assistance to States in the combat of international terrorism. We expect such a task will be carried out by the Executive Director in full coordination with the Chairman of the Committee. A third consideration related to the Executive Director is that the centralization of duties should make it easier for Member States to have access to the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">Finally, I would like to express my Government's satisfaction with the fact that the reform proposal contained in the report of the Committee clearly establishes that one of the functions entrusted to the new structure is to establish a liaison with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and other relevant human rights organizations in matters related to counter-terrorism. That is a most positive step in ensuring that measures adopted at the national level are in strict accordance with the extensive body of international legislation dedicated to the protection and promotion of the most basic human rights. In order for that function to be carried out adequately, we favour the appointment of a specialist in the field of human rights on the staff of experts assigned to the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">The issue now ahead for the Council is to adequately translate this proposal into a resolution capable of reflecting all the improvements we want to incorporate into the structure of the Committee, while fully respecting the Charter of the Organization. We reaffirm our continued and full commitment to the achievement of that lofty goal.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Motoc</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I would like to congratulate Ambassador Arias of Spain and his team for the report presented to the Council today (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>), for their capable stewardship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and for their undertakings for reform. Let me also express our appreciation for the work performed by all members of the Committee in the process of negotiating the report on the revitalization of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">As Romania aligns itself with the statement to be made shortly by Ambassador Ryan of Ireland on behalf of the European Union, I will confine myself to only a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The international community faces a new and most dangerous threat to peace and security: global terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Combating special threats always requires special measures, adopted at a global level and universally implemented. The active participation of all members of the international community is crucial. It is primarily the responsibility of the United Nations and the Security Council to act as a catalyst for all those efforts. Likewise, by assuming the leading role in fighting terrorism, the Security Council reconfirms its capacity to deliver on its responsibilities under the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">Romania joined the efforts to fight terrorism at the international, regional and subregional levels in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, applicable international law and the relevant human rights provisions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">As the CTC is the Security Council's specialized subsidiary body in this area, we attach the utmost importance to its revitalization and reinforcement. The CTC must be provided with adequate means to carry out the responsibilities arising from advancement to the next stage of its work. Consequently, we consider the finalization of the report and the timely adoption of the draft resolution to be vital steps towards a more effective CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Enhancing the CTC's ability to monitor implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is the cornerstone of the process for its revitalization, currently under way, since full compliance with the resolution's provisions by all States is an essential prerequisite for effectively combating terrorism. We note with deep concern that many States continue to face difficulties in fully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, including elaborating and presenting the required reports to the CTC. One indicator in that respect is the increasing number of States which are late in submitting their reports.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">This leads to my next comment, concerning the importance of granting Member States the necessary technical assistance. We trust that the establishment of the new executive structure will generate a more proactive role for the CTC in identifying needs and facilitating technical assistance to Member States. Romania acknowledges the important role played in that respect by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna through its Terrorism Prevention Branch.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">Romania considers the signature, ratification and full implementation of all relevant United Nations conventions relating to terrorism to be an essential component of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We encourage all Member States to become parties to all those conventions as soon as possible. I would like to inform the Council that Romania is in the final stage of ratification of the last of those conventions: the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">I would like to make one final point concerning another important pillar of the future activity of the CTC: increased cooperation and coordination with other United Nations bodies and the relevant international, regional and subregional organizations. The goal of successfully combating the global scourge of terrorism cannot be accomplished except through the joint efforts of the international community as a whole.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">The Security Council is meeting to consider the quarterly report covering October to December 2003, presented by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and to assess the 90 days work of the first quarter of 2004. I would like to take this opportunity to commend in particular Ambassador Arias for his outstanding and dedicated work. I also thank members of the Committee and the independent experts for the work well done.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">We have taken note of the Committee's work regarding implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, in the course of which it reviewed the reports submitted by States, ensured the flow of information from States in compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in the field of technical assistance, took a more proactive approach to the provision of technical assistance to States facing difficulties in complying with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and strengthened cooperation with and among international, regional and subregional organizations with anti-terrorist programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">The period under review marks an important turning point in the short but rich life of the Committee. The report presented on 14 November 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-1084.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/1084</a>) by the Chair of the CTC on the problems encountered in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> identified a number of important operational issues faced by the Committee. The CTC took a more proactive role in the dialogue with Member States, in evaluating implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, in facilitating technical assistance to Member States and in promoting closer cooperation and coordination with international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The report concluded that some problems are being encountered in the implementation of the resolution at both the State and CTC levels, and that those problems should be tackled in a comprehensive way due to the close interlinkage between them and the urgency of the task.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">Today we are seized of the report on the revitalization of the CTC, endorsed by the Committee. We take good note of the Chairman's strategic direction for the proposed reforms and of the commitment of Committee members to finding the best means of forging ahead with the launching of the bases for the revitalization of the Committee -- a need felt by all members of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">The Chairman of the Committee has outlined the main thrust of the reform that we are undertaking. Like all reforms, it will take some time before its effects are felt. As a precautionary measure, a wise decision was taken: a trial period was provided for, set to end 31 December 2005, to review the effectiveness of the reform, along with a sunset clause set for two years later.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">A large number of developing countries -- the most affected and the most vulnerable -- have joined with confidence the fight against terrorism. Many of them have enacted anti-terrorist legislation, but the scarcity of their resources -- financial, technical and human -- impedes the implementation of such a legislative framework. Moreover, such countries lack the executive machinery and the capacity to deal effectively with security, border controls, the movement of criminals, the illegal circulation of firearms, and terrorist networks.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">It is not a lack of political will that is affecting their action. Rather, it is a situation of a shortage of resources, a gap which we have the means to close. I hope that our Committee will continue to act in such a way as to enable that gap to be effectively closed through the provision of technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">We are pleased that the CTC, in its programme of revitalization, has as one of its priorities the strengthening and facilitation of technical assistance to States. In fact, without long-term assistance that is focused on national and regional capacity-building in areas related to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the developing countries will be unable to meet international standards in order to face the grave challenges ahead. It is only through a concerted effort and with international assistance that they will be able to strengthen their capacity to wage an effective combat against terrorism. We welcome the Committee's commitment to strengthen the provision of such assistance to countries in need and its decision to adopt this more proactive approach to its delivery.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">The African Union has set a pioneering example by adopting the Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism in Africa, generally known as the Algiers Convention of 1999. Through that Convention, the African countries are pursuing a shared objective through common action at the intergovernmental level involving the exchange of information on the activities and movements of terrorist groups in Africa and the undertaking of actions designed to step up the fight against terrorism. International cooperation is a vital prerequisite for building capacity in the African countries, allowing them to act more effectively at the national, subregional and continental levels against the financing of terrorism, in the tracking of terrorist networks, and in apprehending and bringing terrorists to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa11">The international community at large should reinforce its cooperation programmes with continental and subregional organizations and with the African countries in areas related to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, in order to strengthen their capacity to fight terrorism.

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, I would like to thank you and your delegation for having organized this important debate on the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). This meeting is taking place at a critical juncture for the Security Council and aims to take stock of the continuing threat of international terrorism and to find ways to improve the Council's response to this menace, primarily through the unique work of the CTC. I thank most sincerely Ambassador Arias, Chairman of the CTC, for his report today on the Committee's work and on the innovations needed to revitalize the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">There is broad agreement that terrorism is one of the defining threats to international peace and security in the twenty-first century. The catalytic moment in everyone's consciousness regarding the seriousness of that threat occurred on 11 September, even though the Security Council has been confronting that menace for many decades, starting from the assassination in 1948 of Count Bernadotte, the United Nations mediator in Palestine.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">The international community is beginning to understand the full extent of the distinct and formidable challenge posed by terrorism to international peace. We all realize that the threat of terrorism necessitates a creative and determined response that is outside of the usual box from which we draw ideas. Terrorism operates on a paradigm that is based on the use of modern technology, which otherwise provides creature comforts to many. Terrorist information is acquired and conveyed through e-mail and the Internet. Terrorist money is transferred through banking facilities or the use of the telephone and other convenient modes of communication. Terrorists themselves travel by aeroplane and have, tragically, used them as weapons to attack. Terrorism has a very different feel from twentieth-century causes of conflicts, because it proceeds from a radical and ideological framework that defies the standard political and military calculations applied to traditional threats to the peace.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">In the face of such an enemy, nothing short of a global war that relies on strong international partnership and cooperation is required. Terrorism has no rational leadership with which negotiations for peace are possible. It is, rather, a different form of warfare, in whose context the Security Council's methods should be as creative, inventive and imaginative as those employed by terrorists, who take advantage of post-modern amenities in their actions.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">While we recognize the need for innovation in the fight against terrorism, our efforts -- even if they are based on Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter -- must be established on and rooted in the bedrock of cooperation and synergy among all Member States. The Security Council must emphasize the fact that the international community's capacity to overcome the challenge of terrorism should be energized by States' finding common interests and purposes rather than by legalistic ideas of enforcement and mandatory obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has been the cornerstone of the Security Council's counter-terrorism measures. We are now in the tenth quarterly work programme of the CTC. The past two and a half years have shown the need to improve the working methods and structure of the CTC. This transformation will require innovative changes, which are outlined in the 19 February report of the CTC and have been ably presented by Ambassador Arias. We hope that the Council can adopt a resolution along the thrusts and structural changes outlined by Ambassador Arias.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">The fight against terrorism poses a huge challenge to the United Nations, particularly the Security Council. The institutional and legal instruments that our 1945 forebears have bequeathed us under the Charter to respond to threats to peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression might not have foreseen the serious threat which terrorism presents today to international peace and security. However, while the Charter would appear limited in that sense, it is, at the same time, sufficient to provide the Security Council with appropriate means to meet that challenge.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">As the Security Council deliberates on various proposals to improve the working methods and structure of the CTC, we hope that Member countries will embrace the changes that may seem outside the usual mould but are required to help States wage an effective battle against terrorism. In the same vein, while employing innovation and creativity in carrying out some degree of transformation of the CTC, the Council should continue to uphold the important and timeless principles enshrined in the Charter to ensure the full cooperation of everyone in the important task of combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">I would like to end by emphasizing one theme. The global effort against terrorism requires the Security Council and the rest of the membership of the United Nations to remain committed partners if success is to be achieved in eradicating the scourge of terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Arias</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">My country fully supports the report of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, presented by the Chairman. I will refer very briefly to the important need to revitalize the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The Counter-Terrorism Committee has carried out praiseworthy work that may nonetheless prove to be sorely inadequate in the short term. I say this in full knowledge of the situation. The United Nations cannot and should not spare any effort in combating that very serious threat to peace. The report approved by the Committee and summarized earlier by the Chairman seeks precisely to strengthen most seriously the flexibility, visibility and, above all, effectiveness of the Committee and the United Nations in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Terrorism and the campaign against it require a concerted and operative effort on the part of the international community. The report before us, avoiding rhetoric and cosmetic proposals, seeks the objective of achieving a united, operational and more effective Committee. I therefore reiterate our support for the report.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zhang Yishan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I should like to begin by thanking you, Sir, for convening today's open meeting. I also thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), the Permanent Representative of Spain, Ambassador Arias, for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">China commends the CTC for its efforts to facilitate the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by all countries and to help developing countries to improve their counter-terrorism capacity-building. We support the CTC in its coordination and cooperation with the relevant international, regional and subregional organizations to fight terrorism. At the same time, we hope that the CTC will step up its efforts to provide counter-terrorism assistance and do its utmost to meet the needs of the developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">The current effort to revitalize the CTC has drawn the attention of the overall membership. After repeated consultations, the CTC has issued a formal report, which it has circulated as a document of the Security Council. After more than two years of operation, the CTC's existing structure and working methods have revealed their shortcomings, such as the overburden of reporting on the part of the Member States and a surfeit of meetings and documents. Its efficiency must be improved and there is a lack of coordination among the experts. We therefore fully support the necessary reform of the CTC and endorse the package of measures contained in the report, including the establishment of an executive directorate.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">We hope that the existing problems will be duly addressed as soon as possible, in particular the issue of overreporting on the part of the Member States. It should be noted that revitalization and reform are an ongoing process. No matter how reform is undertaken, the CTC should maintain its policy guidance over the work of the executive directorate. All decisions should be taken through consensus in the CTC plenary.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa01">My delegation, too, thanks the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Arias, for his detailed and substantial report.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa02">The fight against terrorism within the broadest possible international coalition remains one of Germany's most important policy objectives. Our internationally recognized contributions to that fight are well known and need not be elaborated here. While we fully subscribe to the forthcoming statement by the presidency of the European Union, we would like to highlight the following points.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa03">The Counter-Terrorism Committee has done impressive work and deserves our recognition. We support the CTC's new work programme, as we have always supported its work, and will remain committed to close cooperation. Some weeks ago, we submitted our fourth report under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We have actively contributed to the current efforts to improve the CTC's effectiveness by strengthening its support structure. In our view, this reform must be undertaken in an open and consensual atmosphere, in close cooperation with the Secretariat and the General Assembly and in full respect for the United Nations Charter. In that context, we strongly suggest that the views expressed by the Secretariat in its letter to the Chairman of the CTC, dated 3 March 2004, be carefully analysed and duly taken into account.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa04">Besides strengthening the CTC's internal work structures and procedures, the reform must contribute to further enhancing the CTC's legitimacy in the perception of all United Nations Member States, which have up to now placed their trust and confidence in that major counter-terrorism instrument of the United Nations. This, in our view, also means including an appropriate human rights perspective by appointing a human rights expert as a staff member of the new support structure.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa05">Most important of all, the CTC should improve its capacity to deepen its continuous dialogue with all United Nations Member States on key counter-terrorism issues under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1456 (2003)</a>. The quality, impartiality and intensity of that dialogue are unprecedented in United Nations history and remain a valuable asset on which we can build.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa06">In that context, let me repeat a suggestion that we made during the last open debate. CTC experts could, with the help of the enhanced structure, form joint teams with members of specialized international organizations and actively assist countries in key areas of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1456 (2003)</a>, such as in professionalizing their financial control, border protection, weapons control or law enforcement sectors.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk03-pa07">In conclusion, I would like to express our appreciation of the fact that a great number of Member States are taking the floor today in order to present their views and suggestions on the CTC reform efforts. We can assure them all that we will do our outmost to give their points due consideration in the ongoing consultations on a draft resolution on this matter.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Inocencio Arias, for submitting the Committee's programme of work for the tenth 90-day period (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/32</a>, annex) and particularly for his effective leadership of that important body. My delegation aligns itself with the statement to be made by the representative of Argentina on behalf of the Rio Group; we shall now make a few observations in our national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">My country places priority on the global fight against terrorism and resolutely supports the activities being carried out by the CTC in its work to verify the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We welcome the fact that the Committee has continued to broaden its contacts and its cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations. We believe that that line of action is an important component of the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">The Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee -- which I have the honour to chair -- have appeared in various international forums, as powerful instruments of the Organization in the global fight against terrorism. A recent opportunity was the presence of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and of the sanctions Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> at the Bali Regional Ministerial Meeting on Counter-Terrorism, held on 4 and 5 February and organized jointly by the Governments of Indonesia and Australia.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Technical assistance for those States that need it must continue to be one of the Committee's priorities. We take note of the progress achieved in that area, particularly the preparation of a valuable guide to information and sources of assistance for the fight against terrorism, which is available on the Internet.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">The report on revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex), which we are considering today, contains concrete proposals to improve the Committee's structure and procedures in order to respond more effectively to the mandate conferred on it by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The proposals are intended to strengthen technical assistance and dialogue with States, to increase contacts with the relevant international organizations in the fight against terrorism and, in general, to provide better tools and capacity to the Committee in carrying out its mandate. That is why we support them.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">I should like to emphasize that the report adequately addresses a concern of my delegation that was raised in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>: the obligation of States to ensure that the anti-terrorism measures they adopt meet all their obligations under international law, particularly norms related to human rights, to refugees and to humanitarian law. We are pleased to see that the restructured Committee will maintain regular contacts with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and with other human rights organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">I should like to refer briefly to the Counter-Terrorism Committee's relationship with the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee from the perspective of its future work. Since I assumed the chairmanship of the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee, we have maintained close ties with the Counter-Terrorism Committee through periodic meetings with its Chairman and through contacts between our respective panels of experts. That approach should continue, as envisaged in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>, adopted recently by the Security Council, which reaffirms the need to establish close coordination and a concrete exchange of information between the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">I should like to conclude by reaffirming our country's support for the report on revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, adding that it would be naïve to think that we have won the fight against terrorism. I fear that we will see many more terrorist acts in various parts of the world. But, for countries to gain ground in the fight against terrorism, the CTC's contribution is of the utmost importance. We believe that, with the proposed changes to the Committee and with the will of Member States, the international community will be able to make decisive progress in the fight against the scourge of terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akram</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">The Pakistan delegation would like to join previous speakers in expressing its gratitude to Ambassador Arias for his briefing and for his leadership of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). We have welcomed the work that has been accomplished in the Committee and the submission of its tenth 90-day work programme (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/32</a>, annex). Important progress was made during the past quarter under Ambassador Arias's leadership. We are confident that the Committee will maintain its momentum and that it will implement its work programme.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Over the past 25 years, Pakistan has been a principal victim of terrorism. Since 11 September 2001, we have been at the forefront of the global campaign against terrorism. Confronted by terrorist attacks against innocent people in our cities -- including attacks against the President of Pakistan -- my Government is steadfastly committed to achieving success in the war against terrorism. We believe that, with determination and cooperation -- but also with wisdom -- that war can be fought and won.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Even as we speak, Pakistani forces are engaged in operations to wipe out what remains of the Taliban and Al Qaeda elements on the frontier between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is the first time in Pakistan's history that our armed forces have been deployed in such large numbers -- 70,000 -- in the tribal areas of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan to interdict and hunt down Al Qaeda and Taliban elements. Pakistan has developed an effective intelligence network and a quick-reaction force for that purpose. We have captured more than 500 Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives in this campaign. Needless to say, Pakistan has paid a high human and economic cost in pursuing this anti-terrorist campaign.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">The Counter-Terrorism Committee was set up after 11 September 2001, when the Security Council determined that international terrorism, as a phenomenon, constituted a threat to international peace and security. The CTC was designed as a unique body and was directed to address what was an amorphous, sometimes undefined phenomenon -- a threat whose specific manifestations were not always clear or anticipated.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">Since its establishment, the CTC has accomplished valuable goals: among other things, ensuring general adherence by Member States to international counter-terrorism conventions, energizing States to adopt important legislation, ensuring timely reporting of such national and international efforts to combat terrorism and enhancing coordination among States in the campaign against terrorism. The CTC's accomplishments have been due, in no small measure, to the energy and commitment of its two Chairpersons, first Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom, and currently Ambassador Inocencio Arias of Spain. There is no doubt that the Committee's wide-ranging responsibilities and, especially, the need to ensure timely implementation and reporting of the means adopted by Member States to combat terrorism have imposed a heavy burden on the successive Chairmen and their delegations, as well as on the small Secretariat support staff assisting the CTC. Therefore, Pakistan supports the efforts of the CTC Chairman to revitalize the work of the Committee, as reflected in the CTC's report on its revitalization (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">In our view, the revitalization of the CTC should focus on substance, rather than on form. It is important to assess and encourage concrete actions by States against terrorism, rather than to focus on the evaluation of reports and documents. The CTC should also be enabled to promote a comprehensive approach to combat terrorism, addressing the current and mutating nature of the terrorist threat, the greater and vigorous emphasis on intelligence and information sharing, intelligence analysis, early warning and appropriate law enforcement, administrative and political actions against terrorist threats, including strengthened policing of borders, prevention of terrorist financing and building capacity within States for combating terrorism and extremism. The CTC also needs to address the root causes of terrorism: economic and political injustice, foreign occupation, poverty and extremism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">The Chairman's report has been the subject of extensive discussions in the CTC at the level of experts. We believe there is need to carefully consider the approach outlined in the report and in the draft resolution circulated by the Chairman. We should create institutional or Secretariat structures which conform to the provisions of the Charter and respect the prerogatives and responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">It can be argued that the CTC needs the assistance of an operational body for discharging certain specific tasks within a limited period of time, such as monitoring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, by Member States. Therefore, we would be prepared to consider the creation of a supplementary and special group to assist the Committee with that task. Such a special body should be created for a limited period of time and should not set a precedent for other future structures. We are therefore heartened by the remarks made by the Chairman of the Committee that the proposed structure will be of a special nature and will not set a precedent for the future. Those assurances should be appropriately reflected in the draft resolution which is to be adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">In that context, we also welcome the views conveyed by the Secretariat in a letter to the Chairman of the CTC yesterday. We trust that further consultations on the proposed draft resolution will involve close interaction with the Secretariat, and that its views will be taken into account, and will bring the provisions of the draft resolution in line with the requirements of the Charter. Similarly we hope that the views expressed by non-members of the Security Council in this debate today, will also be taken into account in finalizing the draft resolution. Through such a transparent and interactive process, we look forward to the adoption by consensus of the draft resolution on the CTC's revitalization.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I will now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of France.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">My delegation fully associates itself with the statement to be made by the representative of Ireland on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">We thank Ambassador Inocencio Arias, for the particularly important report that he just presented to us as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), in particular concerning the question of the revitalization of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">My country attaches great importance to the work of the Committee, and we believe that since its establishment a little more than two years ago the Counter-Terrorism Committee has been playing a central role, one that has been rightly recognized by all, in monitoring the due implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In the light of that experience, however, we must acknowledge that this role needs to be strengthened, if we want to enable the Committee better to carry out the task entrusted to it. That is the thrust of the report of the CTC dated 19 February 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex), on its revitalization, to which my delegation lends its full support.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">It is essential to increase the means available to the Committee quantitatively and qualitatively, first and foremost in terms of expertise and logistics. That will determine the effectiveness of the international community's efforts in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">My delegation feels that the Committee now needs to be in a stronger position to assess, in practice, the nature and effectiveness of anti-terrorism measures taken by States pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It can no longer merely consider in New York, national reports submitted by States, however essential that may be. Moreover, the Committee needs to be better equipped to assess the real needs of States for technical assistance. Technical assistance is the essential complement to the normative work being done by the international community. That is the spirit in which the Group of Eight Counter-Terrorism Action Group -- which coordinates the provision of technical assistance depending on the needs expressed by States and in close cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee -- has been working.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">My delegation attaches great importance to the proposal for field visits -- with the agreement, of course, of the States concerned -- in order to intensify the dialogue with States.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">The Committee also needs more effectively to play its role of coordination and cooperation with respect to regional and international institutions and organizations, in order to maximize all of our efforts to root out the scourge of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">Accordingly, the field missions of Counter-Terrorism Committee experts could, for example, usefully include, depending on need, experts from other regional and international institutions or organizations concerned. In particular, I am thinking of the experts from the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the Vienna-based United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, who are already doing an outstanding job in helping States to become parties to the 12 international counter-terrorism instruments and to adopt national legislation to enable them to implement those instruments.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">The fight against terrorism requires more than ever before -- and recent events that have occurred in various parts of the world clearly prove this -- an increased effort on the part of the international community. It is therefore important to give the Counter-Terrorism Committee the means it needs to enable it to discharge the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council, in full compliance, of course, with the provisions of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">My delegation will be working actively to make the revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee a reality through the upcoming adoption of a draft Council resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">I now resume my capacity as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa13">I would like to recall that yesterday, when the Security Council convened its first meeting of the month of March, on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, speakers expressed gratitude to China for its leadership as President of the Council during the month of February, and congratulated France on its assumption of the presidency for the current month. I have always appreciated formulas of courtesy, which I believe reflect the good relations that exist among delegations at the United Nations, and we all know that through courtesy our work is made easier. But, given the long list of speakers, perhaps participants would agree to limit, or even to refrain from conveying, any congratulatory words so that the Council can continue its work with the desired diligence.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa14">As another measure to optimize our use of time, and in order to allow as many delegations as possible to take the floor, I will not invite speakers individually to take seats at the Council table and then to resume their seats at the side of the Chamber. When a speaker takes the floor, the conference officer will seat the next speaker on the list at the table. I thank participants for their understanding and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa15">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Ireland, to whom I give the floor.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The acceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, and the European Free Trade Association countries Iceland and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">The European Union wishes to express its appreciation for the briefing provided to us this morning by Ambassador Arias, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). The European Union attaches real importance to these periodic open debates of the Security Council in which we review the work and progress of the CTC. Today's debate is of particular significance, as members' views and suggestions will provide valuable, concrete input into the revitalization process, including in the Council's ongoing deliberations on the draft resolution on this matter. Such a transparent debate will contribute to a key goal of the reform: that is, to maintain and, hopefully, to strengthen the CTC's general acceptance by -- and perceived legitimacy with -- all members of the United Nations family.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">The European Union welcomes the report of the CTC on its revitalization (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex). No organ is immune from the passage of time and its effects. Responding to the changing nature of this global threat requires agility and flexibility in our thinking and in our structures. In formulating this report, the CTC has expressly recognized this reality and has responded in a considered and constructive way. It is our sincere hope that a revitalized CTC may play an even more prominent role in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">The European Union fully supports the CTC in discharging its mandate. The report recommends a set of measures -- in particular the establishment of a Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate -- that would enable the CTC to fulfil its mandate of monitoring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, facilitating technical assistance to Member States and promoting closer cooperation and coordination with international, regional and subregional organizations. We consider those functions to be crucial to the fight against terrorism and to the central role that the United Nations has in this regard. The European Union takes this opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to cooperate with the CTC, and urges those Member States that have not yet done so to submit their reports to the CTC at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">We are all familiar with the contents of this report. I do not propose, therefore, to engage in a review of all of its aspects, but instead will focus on certain components that the EU believes deserve particular mention.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">First, the revitalization report makes clear that this proposal does not modify <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> or other existing relevant resolutions. The Security Council is not embarked, here, on an overhaul of the substantive provisions of those resolutions. The current reform mainly concerns structural issues.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">Secondly, any proposal to establish new bodies or structures within the United Nations system is often met with a degree of hesitancy or resistance. While there are often many reasons for this, one of those reasons, as we are all aware, is that such committees or structures, once set up, are often difficult to dissolve or disband, even when their original raisons d'être or utility have ceased to exist. This report is perhaps mindful of that fact, in making clear that the new structures put in place will not be a permanent arrangement and in expressly incorporating sunset and review clauses, and is to be particularly commended.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">Also, as the envisioned new Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate involves both the Security Council and the Secretariat, it is imperative that both United Nations organs cooperate closely in its establishment and functioning. Such a new structure may be adequate in view of the special nature of global counter-terrorism efforts, but, as the report rightly underlines, it should not set a precedent for other Security Council bodies. The EU wishes to emphasize that the integrity of the Secretariat and role of the Secretary-General as the chief administrative officer of the Organization must be preserved at all times.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">Thirdly, the European Union is also gratified to see provision made in the report for direct liaison between the proposed Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other human rights organizations in matters related to counter-terrorism. For this purpose, we would recommend, as others have, the recruitment of a human rights expert. We look forward to receiving regular updates in relation to the liaison activities mentioned. The European Union, like others, has consistently stressed that counter-terrorism measures must at all times be accompanied by a respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and, more generally, by respect for the rule of law and legal certainty, especially for individuals. There can be no trade-off between protecting human rights and effective counter-terrorism measures.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">Fourthly, the European Union is reassured by the fact that the projected increase in staffing requirements will be quite modest. The impulsive hiring of additional staff, tempting as it may seem to some as a quick-fix solution, is not a sine qua non for rendering existing operations more effective and efficient. Rather, we should ensure the optimal utilization of available expertise and examine critically the current arrangements, reconfiguring accordingly and amplifying staff numbers only where absolutely necessary. The CTC has wisely adopted this latter approach.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">Fifthly, the Executive Director, as envisaged in the report, will be responsible for numerous important tasks. Facilitating the provision of assistance programmes to States in order to further the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> continues to be an essential challenge. A lot of work is still required of the CTC in this field. The EU therefore welcomes, among other things, the recognition contained in the report of the need to strengthen contacts with States, relevant international, regional and subregional organizations and other bodies of the United Nations system, including the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Development Programme. In reporting on the progress of States in their participation in the relevant international-terrorism-related conventions and protocols, the need for close cooperation by the Executive Director with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should also be noted here.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">The report on revitalization of the CTC is the culmination of many months of intensive deliberation among Committee members. We are grateful to them for the long hours spent in the quest for agreement on a final text. Given those concerted efforts and their successful outcome, it is our genuine hope that a draft resolution reflecting the contents of the report may be agreed upon as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of India.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nambiar</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">We thank you, Mr. President, for providing us with this opportunity to convey our views on recent developments in the international community's collective fight against terrorism. This debate assumes particular relevance in the context of ongoing measures to introduce significant and far-reaching changes in the structure and functioning of the Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). We congratulate Ambassador Arias of Spain on his exemplary chairmanship of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">India's exposure to the ravages of terrorism for over two decades, with the loss of thousands of lives, has only strengthened our resolve to fight this global menace. In the period following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the international community was galvanized to act individually and collectively against the threat of international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">The measures adopted have had considerable impact in restricting, curtailing and limiting the space within which terrorist groups can operate. The most important impact has been the growing perception that terrorism cannot be condoned or supported as a legitimate activity. Any justification -- on diplomatic, political, religious or any other grounds -- for support to terrorism remains untenable.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">The United Nations in general, and the Security Council in particular, have taken firm strides in the period following 11 September 2001 to create and carry forward international momentum on counter-terrorism activities through multilateral means. The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), under the capable leadership earlier of the United Kingdom and now of Spain, has been the focal point of such international efforts. As a result, a large number of States have undertaken measures to create the legislative and administrative frameworks required to counter terrorism. Many are moving towards improving their operational capabilities in tackling terrorists and their networks, both in their respective countries and through global cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">In our own region, the seven States members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), at its twelfth Summit, held at Islamabad in January 2004, signed the Additional Protocol to the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. The Additional Protocol would update the Convention in order to meet the obligations devolving in terms of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The SAARC Islamabad Declaration, noting that the people of South Asia continue to face a serious threat from terrorism, condemned terrorist violence in all its forms and manifestations. It recognized that terrorism violates the fundamental values of the United Nations and the SAARC Charter and constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">In our statement in the Security Council on 18 January 2002 (see <a href="../html/S-PV-4453.html">S/PV.4453</a>) -- soon after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- India recommended to the Counter-Terrorism Committee that its focus should extend to groups that are known to perpetrate terrorism; that it should be proactive in seeking views, in particular from States affected by terrorist acts; that it should not leave unchallenged or un-addressed claims of moral, political and diplomatic support for terrorism, which are clearly in contravention of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>; and that it should institute more effective measures to deny safe haven to terrorists and to seek their extradition.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">Undoubtedly, a lot has been achieved over the past two years. However, continuing acts of terror in different parts of the world by Al Qaeda, the Taliban and their sympathizers, or by groups with a propensity to achieve their questionable objectives in a similar way, illustrate the continued vulnerability of the international community in this regard. The international community must persevere in its efforts to interdict and neutralize terrorist organizations and their networks through dynamic measures designed for maximum global reach. The CTC could increase its effectiveness by going beyond building legislative capacity to improving the operational and administrative capabilities of States and cooperation among States in their counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">We have seen the report of the CTC Chairman on the proposal for the revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, recently adopted by the Committee (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex). India is fully committed, in principle, to any proposal that enables the CTC to improve its effectiveness and strengthen the fight against terrorism. The CTC's effective monitoring of Member States' compliance with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is an objective that India has supported since the adoption of that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">At the same time, new systems require a certain amount of introspection and clear articulation before they are instituted. Those that may have long-term implications on the functioning of the Council and the United Nations, and that might possibly have a bearing on Member States themselves, cannot be considered the sole preserve of the Council. Although some of the questions relating to the proposal on establishing a Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate may well have been addressed and possibly answered in the course of the debate today, the following questions come to mind. What kind of a precedent are we creating by the establishment of an enhanced mechanism such as the Executive Directorate within the Security Council? Is there sufficient rationale for a separate structure within the Secretariat? How effective would a body of 20 experts be in terms of cost and performance? How does the Council propose to ensure the accountability of the Executive Directorate and its institutionalized accessibility to and appropriate consultation with Member States on their concerns and priorities? Finally, have the financial implications of the establishment of the Executive Directorate over a period of three years and the need for its consistency with regular budgetary, administrative and financial practices been fully considered?</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">Other issues that need to be considered are the recruitment of experts on the basis of geographical representation, non-controversial credentials, objective selection, diversity of background, expertise and experience; and the avoidance of duplication and overlap in the functioning of different agencies or bodies elsewhere within the United Nations system engaged in capacity-building on counter-terrorism with that of the Executive Directorate.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">The overall message that India, like most other Member States, would like to convey is one of unstinting support for counter-terrorism efforts arising from the Security Council. Notwithstanding the questions that I posed, the efforts of the CTC to institute effective measures within a transparent and calibrated system will receive our firm support and cooperation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Switzerland, on whom I now call.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Helg</span> <span class="nation">Switzerland</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">I would like first of all to thank Ambassador Arias for his briefing on the work done and the efforts made in recent months by him and all others involved in producing the report on the revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex).</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">The fight against terrorism concerns the entire international community, and it is therefore essential that all States -- not only the members of the Security Council -- be given an opportunity to express their views. I therefore welcome this open debate.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Switzerland hopes that that same concern for transparency will guide the future work of the Committee, in particular the discussion of the Action Plan that the new Executive Director will submit on the strengthening of the role of the Committee. All Member States should be able to take part in the discussion of that plan from the outset, and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate should be established with full respect for the prerogatives of the Secretary-General and the institutional rules that govern the functioning of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">The report on the revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee is a first important step towards strengthening the role of the Committee. I would therefore like to highlight several aspects of this issue that Switzerland considers particularly important.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">First of all, there should be closer cooperation between the Committee and other international bodies concerned with terrorism. The Committee's activities should not duplicate or compete with what is being done elsewhere. There is a need for synergy both with regional organizations and with specialized bodies such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, located in Vienna.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">As for visits to Member States, Switzerland welcomes the fact that clear guidelines will be established. The Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee, as well as experts from the Monitoring Group, are also carrying out such visits. It is vital that we exploit more effectively any future synergy between that Committee, its experts and the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">On several occasions, Switzerland has expressed its determination to participate in the fight against terrorism and has demonstrated that determination through numerous specific measures. The necessary fight against terrorism can and must be carried out without sacrificing respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. In its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-58-187.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 58/187</a>, adopted on 22 December 2003, the General Assembly underlined the importance of respect for human rights in formulating measures to combat terrorism and called for greater consideration of existing instruments and mechanisms in the area of human rights. In that context, I would like to stress two points.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">First, with respect to the planned improvement of the Counter-Terrorism Committee's ability to collect information, I would like to emphasize that it is necessary to collect and process that data in compliance with international rules on the protection of individuals and data.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">Secondly, it is important to strengthen collaboration between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Switzerland welcomes the fact that this is among the proposals in the report on the revitalization of the Committee. We would be interested in learning more about the concrete setting up of that liaison mechanism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">The creation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee was an exceptional measure that was taken to respond quickly to an urgent situation. Today, we know that the fight against terrorism and its financing is a protracted challenge. Thus, it is necessary to think of the long term rather than of emergency measures. The planned re-examination of the Committee's new structures will provide an opportunity to reflect on the Committee's role in the long term.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">My country is of the view that the crucial question is whether the fight against terrorism within the framework of the United Nations should continue to be the primary responsibility of a subsidiary body of the Security Council. A possible alternative would be to establish a central office under the authority of the Secretary-General. In any event, a new formula should be found to enable all States to participate more fully in the current efforts to combat terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Belarus, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ivanou</span> <span class="nation">Belarus</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Republic of Belarus, I first thank you, Sir, for convening this meeting and for providing this opportunity to address the Security Council on the problem of terrorism, which is of concern to the entire international community and which has been the focus of the Council's constant attention since the events of 11 September 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">We commend the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in monitoring and providing assistance to States in their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. At the same time, that work requires some improvements in order to ensure full implementation of that resolution, which can be enhanced by the measures set out in the Committee's report of 19 February 2004 (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">Belarus hopes that the new structure proposed for the CTC and the inclusion in its work of a strategy for active links will speed up the process of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and will create the conditions necessary for more effectively providing States with technical assistance to strengthen their counter-terrorism capacities. Belarus supports the existing format and principles of the Committee's work, which encourage consensus in the international community regarding the threat to international peace and security posed by terrorism and on practical steps to counter that threat.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">The constructive interaction of the Republic of Belarus with the Committee on legislation to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has a positive impact on our national legal system and supplements cooperation to improve counter-terrorism legislation with other international organs, in particular the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">In this area, Belarus expects of the Committee not just an overall assessment of the degree of development of various norms of national counter-terrorism legislation but also concrete recommendations on how to bring our legislation into conformity with international standards, based on a thorough study of the experiences of other countries possessing legal systems of a similar nature.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">On 21 January of this year, a national seminar was held in Minsk on the implementation of the universal counter-terrorism conventions in the legislation of the Republic of Belarus. That seminar was organized by State entities of Belarus, together with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In that seminar, which included the participation of international experts, a detailed analysis was made of the anti-terrorist provisions of our national legislation. That analysis confirmed that those provisions were rather progressive in nature and, on the whole, in keeping with the provisions of the international conventions to combat terrorism to which Belarus is a party.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">The need to supplement national legislation arises basically with regard to the ratification of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. It is proposed that the ratification of that Convention will take place in the spring session of the Parliament of the Republic of Belarus, concluding the process of formalizing our Government's participation in the 12 main international conventions against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">At Security Council meetings on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, Belarus has repeatedly drawn attention to the real national situation in the area of combating terrorism, which is marked by a lack of information on terrorist activities, including their financing. Given our situation as a transit country, Belarus has made a top priority of adopting measures to strengthen customs, migration and border controls to prevent terrorist movement and to combat criminal activities linked to terrorism. The Government of the Republic of Belarus welcomes CTC assistance in resolving those tasks, in the light of our previous request for technical assistance. Such assistance would help to enhance cooperation with the Committee as it carries out its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, I thank the leadership of the CTC, in particular the Chairman, Mr. Inocencio Arias, for his tireless efforts to advance the work of the CTC, which is an exceptionally important body for combating terrorism under the aegis of the United Nations and for creating a broad international counter-terrorism network.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kazykhanov</span> <span class="nation">Kazakhstan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank you, Sir, for organizing this open debate on the agenda item under consideration, which provides an additional opportunity to review the progress made in the fight against terrorism and to determine priorities for the subsequent work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">My delegation commends Ambassador Arias for the effective and inspiring leadership he has displayed in steering the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). I would also like to thank the Chairman for his informative briefings and his excellent presentation of the report of the CTC, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/124</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">Kazakhstan, like other States, recognizes the leading role of the United Nations in erecting effective and secure anti-terrorism barriers. We strongly believe that the issue of combating terrorism should remain a top priority on the agenda of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">Kazakhstan expresses its appreciation to the Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee for their actions to ensure the full and comprehensive implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The Committee's efforts to improve the counter-terrorism legislative framework and the national arrangements of Member States are quite commendable and should be recognized.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">It is encouraging to note that an overwhelming majority of Member States have acceded, or are about to complete their accession, to 12 international conventions against terrorism. At the same time, we believe that it is time to elevate to a qualitatively new level our joint action to develop and enhance international norms and universal arrangements in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa06">Along with our efforts to establish effective international counter-terrorism mechanisms, we should continue to conduct an in-depth study of the root causes of this evil. Here, we cannot afford a mistake.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">We strongly support the efforts of the CTC to pursue an open dialogue with Member States in the spirit of transparency and its assistance to countries in order to enhance their capacity to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa08">Yet we would like to underscore that our overall effectiveness in the combat against international terrorism, coordinated by the United Nations and its Security Council, will depend to a great extent on the further revitalization of the CTC. In that context, our delegation supports changes in the operation of the Committee and its dialogue with Member States in evaluating the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as introduced in the CTC report. Indeed, this is a priority task.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa09">In our view, it is essential to step up the CTC's activities aimed at providing technical and expert assistance to Member States in order to strengthen their counter-terrorism capacity. Since modern-day terrorism is so closely associated with illegal trafficking in drugs, arms and persons, the strengthening of the border guard, customs and law enforcement agencies of those States located on drug-trafficking routes from Afghanistan has thus become a top priority for the Central Asian region.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa10">My delegation encourages the CTC in its efforts to intensify its cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations. Closer interaction between the Committee and regional organizations will go a long way towards building on its accomplishments and revitalizing its work. A number of regional organizations, including in Eurasia, already have in place effectively operating counter-terrorism structures.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa11">As indicated in the aforementioned report, the main provisions related to the revitalization of the CTC are to be reflected in a Security Council draft resolution on the issue. We believe that this proposal should enjoy the support of the members of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa12">Kazakhstan has been fully cooperating with the Counter-Terrorism Committee since its establishment and will continue to provide all necessary support to this important body by making every effort to oppose terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Japan, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I should like to state at the outset that Japan supports the report before us. On that basis, let me stress the following four points.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">First, Japan believes that, in restructuring the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), it is important to secure the coordination of existing structures within the United Nations, such as the Secretariat, and thereby to strengthen the United Nations as a whole. We are convinced that the role of the CTC will be further strengthened if, as recommended in the report, the Committee is able to enlist the services of experts who are well versed in the various trends reflected in recent terrorist acts, and if, with their assistance, the CTC is able to analyse the large body of information gathered from Member States and to propose common measures to be taken by all States, as well as specific measures to be taken by certain States, for the eradication of terrorism. However, since technical support such as assistance in developing legislative measures related to counter-terrorism is already provided by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), we would like to request the CTC fully to coordinate and cooperate with other United Nations organs, as mentioned in the recent report, so that there will be no duplication of work among them.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">Secondly, I would like to stress the importance of promoting and enhancing support for counter-terrorism measures. While we appreciate the role which has been played by the CTC in this regard, we believe that the CTC, under its new structure, should continue to facilitate appropriate technical assistance, for example by sending experts to the countries concerned. Japan, believing in the importance of promoting cooperation to combat international terrorism, has been actively extending assistance for capacity-building. My Government has been holding a variety of seminars with a view to assisting in capacity-building for counter-terrorism, primarily for Asian countries, in six main areas: immigration control, transportation security, customs cooperation, export control, police and law enforcement, and measures against terrorist financing.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">Thirdly, I would like to emphasize the need to continue to assign high priority to cutting off the sources of funding that make terrorist activities possible and to preventing the outflow of arms to terrorists. Such measures are indispensable for preventing terrorism. For that purpose, importance should also be attached to the CTC's coordination of activities with those of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)</a> -- the so-called Taliban and Al Qaeda sanctions Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">Japan has taken measures to freeze the funds and other financial assets of well over 400 individuals and entities implicated in terrorist activities. We intend to continue encouraging Member States to enact the domestic legislation needed in order to take measures against the financing of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Fourthly, as I said at the outset, Japan supports the recent report on revitalization of the CTC. However, that does not mean that expenditures for that purpose should be allowed to grow unrestrained. In that regard, we would like to commend the point made in paragraph 6 of the most recent report that all measures to be taken, including reinforcement of the CTC structure, "should not increase in a disproportionate way the budget and resources already allocated to the CTC."</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">It is also important to ensure transparency with regard to the sources of financing of the CTC's activities. We are often warned that when a new organization is established, people tend to attach more importance to its continuation and expansion than to its original objectives. In this connection, I would like also to welcome the inclusion in the proposal of a sunset clause terminating the new structure on 31 December 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">The CTC is now well into its third year of work. We believe that the time has come to verify once again whether the counter-terrorism measures which we have been taking are functioning effectively, both in their organizational and their operational aspects. In this regard as well, my Government believes that the recent proposal is on the right track. Expectations are high regarding what the CTC is capable of achieving. I would like to request that the work conducted by the CTC be reviewed continuously and seriously with a view to verifying whether the Committee is effectively fulfilling its goals. I would also like to add that the work of the CTC is a matter of interest to all States Members of the United Nations. I hope, therefore, that future reports concerning the evaluation of the activities of the CTC will be provided to all Member States without delay.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Terrorism remains a major threat to international peace and security. The latest outbreaks of terror in Baghdad, Karbala and the Pakistani city of Quetta killed scores of innocent people as tens of thousands of Shi'ite pilgrims from the Muslim world gathered for Ashura, the holiest day in the Shi'ite religious calendar. These and other terrorist acts have reminded us once again that the problem of terrorism requires sustained, long-term global action. We therefore share the view expressed by many delegations today that the Security Council, through its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), should continue to play a leading role in promoting cooperation in the fight against this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">The Council has created the necessary framework for a global response to international terrorism, and it has to be maintained and reinforced. We are pleased, therefore, that the Committee has continued to work actively to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We are grateful to Ambassador Arias and to the team of experts of the Secretariat for their outstanding work. The CTC has already done an enormous job. Furthermore, as was mentioned earlier, it has evolved to assume a more proactive role in the dialog with Member States, in facilitating technical assistance to Member States and in promoting closer cooperation and coordination with international, regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">We note with appreciation the efforts of the Chairman of the Committee and its members to elaborate practical measures to give the CTC proper means to fulfil its tasks. We share the view that the CTC's supporting staff of experts and secretariat should be reorganized within the existing United Nations structure in order to enhance the Council's ability to monitor and encourage implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The establishment of the Committee's Executive Directorate will, in our view, facilitate the work of the Committee and increase its expert potential in all relevant fields.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">We think that technical assistance should be facilitated for those countries that require it. Furthermore, the Committee should extend the technical assistance to cover various activities related to counter-terrorism. In that regard, I would like to refer specifically to the problem of the Chernobyl exclusion zone in Ukraine. The zone, surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power plant -- the site of the world's largest nuclear catastrophe -- comprises 76 abandoned settlements, including the towns of Prypyat and Chernobyl, as well as 800 sites where nuclear waste and contaminated materials have been dumped. There still exists a great risk of unauthorized penetration into the zone and removal of the contaminated substances, which, inter alia, could be used by potential terrorists for their own purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">To secure the exclusion zone and to ensure that such radioactive materials are kept out of reach of unauthorized persons, the Government of Ukraine has been working on numerous projects. In this regard, an appropriate request was transmitted to the CTC for its advice and support. We would be grateful if that request were granted and are waiting for specific proposals in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">In addition, I would like to draw the Council's attention to the possibility of using the Chernobyl exclusion zone and abandoned settlements within its territory for working out practical measures on the prevention of acts of nuclear terrorism, as well as for the training of appropriate personnel. Ukraine is ready to consider all proposals from interested parties.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">Secondly, Ukraine, as a member of the regional organization comprising Georgia, Ukraine, the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Moldova (GUUAM), attaches great importance to cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and regional and subregional organizations. We welcome the CTC's endeavours to facilitate the dialogue and the exchange of information between such organizations. I refer here specifically to the Committee's special meeting last March in New York with representatives of regional organizations and the follow-up meeting at the headquarters of the Organization of American States, in which GUUAM participated and played an active part. A regular exchange of opinions and information between representatives of regional bodies will definitely benefit the global anti-terrorist struggle.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">Thirdly, the issue of combating the legalization of proceeds from crime, which constitutes one of the major sources of terrorism financing, has become especially vital. In this regard, the more stringent requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund represent a strong contribution to the consolidation of global efforts to prevent and rebuff that extremely dangerous phenomenon. We hope that the cooperation of the Committee with those institutions will be further facilitated.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">Let me also reiterate that the Government of Ukraine fully supports the international measures in this sphere, demonstrating its openness and readiness for cooperation. Last Friday, FATF announced at its plenary meeting that, due to the efforts made by the Government of Ukraine, it has removed my country from its list of non-cooperative countries and territories. Ukraine will continue to pay paramount attention to the enhancement of its national system of combating money-laundering and terrorism financing.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">In conclusion, I would like to express the hope that the Council will take all appropriate measures referred to in the report of the Committee's Chairman for the benefit of our common cause.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">On behalf of the members of the Council, I extend a warm welcome to The Honourable Marian Hobbs, Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control of New Zealand, and invite her to take the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Hobbs</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">It is my honour to address the Council on behalf of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum group of countries that maintain permanent missions in New York: Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, New Zealand.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">The countries of the Pacific Islands Forum group reaffirm our unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and our continuing determination to fight against terrorism by all means possible, consistent with human rights and the rule of law. As history has too often demonstrated to us, no State is immune from acts of terrorism. The threat of terrorism, although always present, has increasingly assumed an international character, including the frightening prospect of terrorists' obtaining access to weapons of mass destruction -- an issue that will be considered tomorrow at a seminar on weapons of mass destruction and the United Nations, organized by the International Peace Academy with the support of the Government of New Zealand.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">Terrorism is a global problem and, if it is to be eliminated, requires action at the national, regional and international levels. The Pacific Islands Forum therefore supports the work of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> brought a significant new element to the existing multilateral counter-terrorism framework. If the objectives of the resolution are to be attained, it will require full and meaningful implementation of its requirements. This, in turn, requires the Counter-Terrorism Committee to take a proactive role, in consultation with Member States, in evaluating the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, focused and directed at increasing and improving the capacity of States -- particularly small island States -- in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">This meeting provides a useful opportunity to reflect on the work so far done by the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the road that lies ahead to ensure the full implementation of the now landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We welcome the Council's analysis of these issues and its determination to see the Committee take a clear and pragmatic direction in its future work, as reflected in its proposal for the revitalization of the Committee contained in the report under discussion today. The clarification of the roles of the Council, the CTC and the new Executive Directorate set out in the report should, in our view, significantly assist in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">As a group made up of primarily developing States, many of them small island States, the Pacific Islands Forum places particular emphasis on capacity-building. We accordingly welcome the report's renewed focus on strengthening direct dialogue with States and relevant organizations. The task of the new Assessment and Technical Assistance Office in following up on the technical assistance needs of Member States will be particularly important as the CTC moves ahead with its work.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">Continued efforts at the regional and subregional levels will remain critical to translating the terms of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> into effective action. The Pacific Islands Forum group has taken a number of steps to increase its political and technical cooperation in that field. With the assistance of the Forum secretariat and regional donor partners, work is ongoing to ensure that a robust and consistent framework of anti-terrorism measures is in place across the region. A Pacific roundtable on counter-terrorism will be held in Wellington, New Zealand, in early May to further that goal.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">As we face the evolving challenge of terrorism, and as we work to implement the letter and the spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee can be assured of the continuing full support of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum group.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chungong Ayafor</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">Thirty months ago, following the tragic attacks of 11 September 2001, the Security Council unanimously adopted its historic <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> under Chapter VII of the Charter. That resolution has become the road map for a worldwide mobilization against terrorism. It is only natural that from time to time we should stop to assess the progress we have together made in this common struggle, which we hope will never let up. Terrorism is unjustifiable. It is unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">Mr. President, I want to say how much we appreciate your initiative to convene this open debate on an item that has mobilized us all. Also, I congratulate Ambassador Arias on the detailed updated information he has just provided about the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), which he has chaired in an outstanding manner since April 2003. In his statement earlier this morning, he did not merely take stock of the situation; he spoke also about the necessary revitalization of the Committee's working methods to ensure greater effectiveness and more productive endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">In general, the Committee's record is a positive one. The Committee has already considered 461 reports in less than three years: that is a record in the history of the United Nations. To that we can add the following achievements: the establishment of a global anti-terrorism network involving States and international, regional and subregional organizations; ensuring awareness by the international community of the threat posed by terrorism and of the need for a united fight against it; the creation of a real counter-terrorism database; and strong encouragement over the past three years to ratify the 12 international counter-terrorism instruments.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">We must keep up this momentum by providing the Committee with means commensurate with its mission. For that reason, Cameroon supports Ambassador Arias's suggestions for addressing the problems encountered by States and by the Committee in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Here, I welcome the revitalization proposal the Committee approved on 19 February.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">Cameroon has always advocated strengthening the current legal framework, which remains sectoral in nature and which thus displays gaps. We will therefore continue to join other members of the great United Nations family in their efforts to bring to fruition the plans for a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention and for a convention to prevent and punish acts of nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">In addition to such legal concerns, there is also the question of building the capacity of some States, such as mine, to enable them to combat terrorism effectively. True, the Committee is considering that question as a matter of priority, but the logistical and technological gap between States remains, and it could be exploited at any time by terrorists and their sponsors. Here, we hope that idea once put forward by the French delegation -- of providing the Committee with a special counter-terrorism fund -- is still of interest to the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa07">The new, ambitious programme of work appeals to us, and, naturally, we fully support it. We also note with approval the profound concern for greater productivity and effectiveness that now seems to be the Committee's leitmotif. It is from that perspective that we view the Committee's determination to make its activities more operational. We share the view that it is not enough just to adopt national counter-terrorism legislation or to become parties to the various international conventions on the subject: we must first and foremost ensure that these measures are effectively implemented.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa08">That is also how we understand the Committee's determination to review its working methods. The delegation of Cameroon has always considered that the three phases -- A, B and C -- for analysing the reports submitted by States did not provide the best way of assessing the international community's efforts in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa09">Further, my country considers that the establishment of a Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate could provide the Committee with a real mechanism both to follow up and monitor its work and to assess its activities with a view to adapting them as necessary. Setting up an assessment and technical assistance office within the Directorate, inter alia, to provide liaison with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other human rights organizations would meet the legitimate concerns of many Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa10">My country would be happy to welcome those in charge of that structure, once they have been appointed, in order to strengthen our dialogue and our fruitful relationship of cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We also welcome the news that, in the sphere of technical assistance, the Committee has decided to go beyond the role of a mere intermediary between donors of assistance and applicants, and to play a more active role in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa11">With its proven links with transnational organized crime, terrorism today poses a real threat to international peace and security. Our common fight must therefore be a long-term endeavour; it must be based on a clear-minded strategy that will rally support and that encompasses the elimination or reduction of intolerance, injustice and poverty, and the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Requeijo Gual</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">My Government thanks the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) for the revitalization proposals set out in the annex to <a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/124</a>. In that connection, we believe all Member States would benefit if the CTC could be more effective in its work.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">Cuba believes that unilateral actions or pre-emptive wars on the part of one State or a group of States -- however powerful they may be -- using the fight against terrorism as a pretext are totally unacceptable and deserve categorical condemnation.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">There will be progress only through international cooperation, not through acts of war, aggression or revenge, which will only lead to more violence. Nor will any progress be made through the promulgation of laws authorizing the extrajudicial execution or arbitrary detention of a country's nationals or of foreign citizens, through covert actions violating laws and borders, through the manipulation of public opinion, through discrimination against or persecution of immigrants, through disregard of international humanitarian law, through the violation of human rights or the restriction of civil liberties inherent in the rule of law, through unilateral sanctions or through the listing or certification of countries for dark political purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">We need to wage an international fight against all forms and manifestations of terrorism, with the participation of Third World countries as equals, transcending political, religious or other any other kind of differences, in order to build a just world of free peoples and sovereign, independent States -- a world without international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">Cuba was one of the first three countries to ratify the 12 international instruments on terrorism as a contribution to the international confrontation against such acts. In December 2001, Cuba adopted its Law 93 against acts of terrorism and additional effective non-legislative measures. We have also cooperated, on our own initiative and in good faith, with the Security Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee, to which we have submitted three exhaustive reports in a timely manner; we are now preparing a fourth. In addition, we have actively supported the negotiation of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">Cuba has never permitted its territory to be used for terrorist actions against any State, without exception, and has stated that it will do everything in its power to prevent that from happening in the future. Cuba has never carried out, financed, tolerated or permitted a terrorist act -- not even in self-defence -- against the direct authors or masterminds of abominable crimes against our people that the Cuban American National Foundation and other groups belonging to Miami's terrorist mafia have of late financed, organized and carried out from United States territory with absolute impunity -- including bombings, attempts to assassinate Cuban leaders and attacks against targets vital to our economy.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">On 15 March in Panama, there will be a trial of four terrorists of Cuban origin, who, following the instructions of similar organizations based in the United States -- from where they operate with total impunity -- planned an attack against the Cuban President during the Ibero-American Summit held in November 2000 in that country. For more than three decades, those terrorists carried out horrible crimes against the Cuban people, who hope that they will be sentenced in the trial so that justice will prevail over impunity.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">Cuba categorically rejects the insidious statements of senior United States officials, who have referred repeatedly to alleged plans in my country to develop weapons of mass destruction. The most recent of those statements was made in Japan in mid-February. Through such false statements, the Government of the United States seeks to create conditions enabling it to expand its aggressive policy, which could even lead to military aggression. Similarly, we reject the arbitrary inclusion of Cuba on a United States list of countries that supposedly support terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">Cuba will comply with the laws it has adopted as a sovereign Power and expresses its readiness to cooperate with all countries, with full respect for the Charter and international law. In that spirit, Cuba has proposed on three occasions to the Government of the United States -- without conditions and in accordance with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- three draft bilateral agreements, concerning cooperation in the fight against terrorism, illicit drug trafficking and trafficking in persons. Although the United States has refused -- under mere pretexts -- even to consider them, Cuba still hopes that that policy will change.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa10">It is impossible to eliminate terrorism if we condemn some terrorist acts while we keep silent about others or tolerate or justify them. The terrorism against Cuba must stop. In Miami, with complete impunity and with the complicity of the United States authorities, funds are provided and collected to carry out terrorist acts; bank accounts that finance terrorism operate openly and normally; terrorists are recruited; supplies of weapons are provided; safe refuge is offered; and those who finance, plan and commit acts of terrorism are allowed to use the territory. While that has been taking place, five young Cubans have been incarcerated in the United States for more than five years, having been subjected to excessive confinement and isolation for long periods of time. In some cases, they have been unable to contact their wives and families since their imprisonment. A spurious court in Miami sentenced them to imprisonment for life or for many years, prohibiting them, upon their release, from visiting places where certain terrorist groups are based -- groups that they had been observing in order to prevent such acts from being committed in Cuba or on United States territory. Cuba has provided sufficient information to the Counter-Terrorism Committee on this case and has repeatedly denounced the double standard being applied in the alleged fight against terrorism by the Government of the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa11">The Cuban delegation hopes that all efforts aimed at revitalizing the Counter-Terrorism Committee will lead to its more efficient functioning and will enable it to respond more effectively to the concerns expressed by Member States. Cuba, which has presented substantial evidence of terrorist actions against our country -- in flagrant violation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and of other legally binding instruments -- would like to know what practical actions the Committee and the Security Council plan to carry out in that respect.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kim Sam-hoon</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa01">The delegation of the Republic of Korea welcomes the convening of this open debate as a valuable opportunity for non-members to contribute to the deliberations of the Security Council on the revitalization of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa02">Much progress has been made in the fight against international terrorism since the adoption of the landmark <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the subsequent establishment of the CTC. Undeniably, the CTC continues to play a pivotal role in drawing the attention of the international community to the threats posed by international terrorism and in building capacity at all levels to counter that scourge. Notwithstanding the accomplishments of the CTC thus far, the challenges ahead remain daunting, particularly given the increasing opportunities for terrorist groups to exploit the new technologies and networks of globalization for their nefarious activities. In our view, it is imperative to act now, to strengthen international cooperation in this field on the basis of a unified, multilateral and multifaceted strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa03">Against that backdrop, I would like to share briefly some of the Republic of Korea's observations on the report regarding the revitalization of the CTC (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa04">First, we fully concur with the need to revitalize the CTC with a view to strengthening the international legal framework and establishing uniform benchmarks for all States. In that context, the Republic of Korea recently ratified two terrorism-related international conventions, namely, the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. That makes the Republic of Korea a party to all 12 terrorism-related conventions and protocols.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa05">Secondly, recognizing the potential for regional efforts to supplement and reinforce international efforts in the fight against terrorism, we believe that the CTC should be revitalized in a way that will enhance cooperation and coordination at the international, regional and sub-regional levels. In the absence of regional conventions on terrorism in the Asian-Pacific region, the Republic of Korea has worked to strengthen mutual cooperation under the existing bilateral framework.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa06">Thirdly, we value the proposed new structure for the CTC, which includes a plenary and a bureau as well as a CTC Executive Directorate to be led by an Executive Director. We believe that through the implementation of this proposal, the CTC will be better positioned to achieve its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa07">Fourthly, we believe that the facilitation of technical assistance should remain one of the key objectives of a revitalized CTC. Acknowledging the need to strengthen cooperation at the working level, my Government has provided several capacity-building programmes to support those countries that need assistance in combating terrorism. Moreover, we will continue to work in partnership with regional organizations, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and ASEAN Regional Forum, to broaden capacity-building and promote closer regional cooperation in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa08">In closing, my delegation wishes to extend its unswerving support to the fight against international terrorism and looks forward to working in close cooperation with a revitalized Counter-Terrorism Committee to that end.</p>
