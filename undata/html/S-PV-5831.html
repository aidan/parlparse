	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Council welcomes the announcement of progress in the negotiations, overseen by Kofi Annan, between Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga on 1 February, including the adoption of an agenda and timetable for action to end the crisis in Kenya following the disputed 27 December elections. The Council welcomes the African Union communiqué, commends the efforts of the African Union, President Kufuor of Ghana and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and emphasizes its full support for the Panel of Eminent African Personalities, led by Kofi Annan, in assisting the parties in finding a political solution. The Council deplores the widespread violence following the elections, which has resulted in extensive loss of life and serious humanitarian consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Council expresses its deep concern that, despite the commitments made on 1 February, civilians continue to be killed, subjected to sexual and gender-based violence and displaced from their homes. The Council emphasizes that the only solution to the crisis lies through dialogue, negotiation and compromise and strongly urges Kenya's political leaders to foster reconciliation and to elaborate and implement the actions agreed to on 1 February without delay, including by meeting their responsibility to engage fully in finding a sustainable political solution and taking action to immediately end violence, including ethnically-motivated attacks, dismantle armed gangs, improve the humanitarian situation and restore human rights. Recalling the need to avoid impunity, the Council calls for those responsible for violence to be brought to justice. It expresses its concern at the political, security and economic impact of the crisis in Kenya on the wider region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Council expresses its strong concern at the continuing dire humanitarian situation in Kenya and calls for the protection of refugees and internally displaced persons. The Council further expresses its concern at the safety of humanitarian workers and United Nations personnel and calls on all parties to facilitate their work and ensure their safety. The Council welcomes the decisions, following consultations with the Government of Kenya, of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide to dispatch missions to Kenya. It calls on Kenya's political leaders to facilitate the work of these missions and looks forward to being informed by the Secretary-General of their findings.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Council further requests the Secretary-General to report on how the United Nations can further support the mediation efforts in Kenya and on, as necessary, the impact of the crisis on the wider subregion and United Nations operations in the subregion."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-4.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/4</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
