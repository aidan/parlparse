	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I would like to recall that at its 4345th meeting, on 5 July 2001, the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1361(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1361 (2001)</a>, by which it decided that the election to fill the vacancy in the International Court of Justice should take place on 12 October 2001 at a meeting of the Security Council and at a meeting of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">This morning the Security Council and the General Assembly will proceed independently with the election, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Statute of the Court, for the purpose of filling the vacancy which occurred on 30 September 2001 owing to the resignation of Judge and former President Mohammed Bedjaoui (Algeria).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">The Security Council has before it the following documents: <a href="../pdf/S-2001-882.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/882</a>, which contains the list of nominations of the candidates by national groups of States parties to the International Court of Justice Statute; <a href="../pdf/S-2001-882-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/882/Add.1</a>, in which the Secretary-General notified of the withdrawal nominated by national groups; and <a href="../pdf/S-2001-883-Corr.2.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/883/Corr.2</a>, which contain the curricula vitae of the candidates nominated by national groups of States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">I should also like to inform the Council that, after the expiration of the deadline for the submission of nominations, the Secretariat has been informed that the Italian national group nominated Mr. Nabil Elaraby as a candidate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">The Security Council also has before it a note by the Secretary-General, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-881.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/881</a>, describing the present composition of the Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in the conduct of the election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">I should like to remind the Council that, under article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">The required majority in the Security Council is eight votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">Article 15 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides that</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"A member of the Court elected to replace a member whose term of office has not expired shall hold office for the remainder of his predecessor's term."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">Accordingly, the member elected to fill the remainder of the term left vacant by the resignation of Judge Mohammed Bedjaoui will serve until 5 February 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The voting will be held by secret ballot. When we proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive a ballot paper containing the names of the candidates. No withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers have been distributed. However, it would be possible to withdraw between ballots. Members of the Council will be requested to place an "X" in the box next to the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. Votes may be cast only for a candidate whose name appears on the ballot paper.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">I should like to remind members of paragraph 15 of the Secretary-General's memorandum, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-881.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/881</a>, which specifies that</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"Each elector may vote for only one candidate."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">Any ballot paper containing votes for more than one name will be considered invalid. When a candidate has obtained the required majority of votes, I shall communicate the result to the President of the General Assembly, and I shall request the Council to remain in session pending the receipt from the President of the General Assembly of the result of the voting in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">The Council will now proceed to draw lots to select two delegations -- excluding Ireland, which is presiding over the Council during the month of October -- to serve as tellers.</p>
