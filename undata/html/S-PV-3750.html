	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council recalls its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-868(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 868 (1993)</a> and expresses its grave concern at the recent increase in attacks and the use of force against United Nations and other personnel associated with United Nations operations, as well as personnel of international humanitarian organizations, including murder, physical and psychological threats, hostage taking, shooting at vehicles and aircraft, mine-laying, looting of assets and other hostile acts. The Council is also gravely concerned at attacks on and violations of United Nations premises. The Council is concerned that these attacks and the use of force have in some instances been carried out by certain groups with the deliberate goal of disrupting negotiating processes, international peacekeeping activities and hampering humanitarian access.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council reiterates its condemnation of such acts. It emphasizes the unacceptability of any acts endangering the safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel, as well as personnel of international humanitarian organizations. The Council urges all Member States and others concerned to prevent and bring to an end all such acts. It stresses that the perpetrators of such acts bear responsibility for their actions and should be prosecuted.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of ensuring the safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel, as well as the inviolability of United Nations premises which are essential to the continuation and successful implementation of United Nations operations. In this context it emphasizes that the host country and others concerned must take all appropriate steps to ensure the safety and security of United Nations personnel and premises. It reiterates that the cooperation of all Member States and others concerned is indispensable for the mandates of United Nations operations to be carried out and demands that they respect fully the status of United Nations and associated personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council supports all efforts effectively to promote and protect the safety and security of United Nations and associated personnel. In this context the Council recalls the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, adopted by the General Assembly on 9 December 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council pays tribute to all military, police and civilian staff of United Nations and other personnel associated with United Nations operations, as well as personnel of international humanitarian organizations, for their courageous efforts to achieve peace and to alleviate the suffering of the people living in conflict areas."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-13.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/13</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
