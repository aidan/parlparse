	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-2000-373.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/373</a>, which contains a letter dated 2 May 2000 from Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">Members of the Council also have received photocopies of a letter dated 4 May 2000 from Sierra Leone, which will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-2000-380.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/380</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the outbreak of violence in Sierra Leone in recent days. It condemns in the strongest terms the armed attacks perpetrated by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) against the forces of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and their continued detention of a large number of United Nations and other international personnel. The Council expresses its outrage at the killing of a number of United Nations peacekeepers of the Kenyan battalion and its deep concern for the UNAMSIL troops who have been wounded or remain unaccounted for.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">"The Security Council demands that the RUF end its hostile actions, release immediately and unharmed all detained United Nations and other international personnel, cooperate in establishing the whereabouts of those unaccounted for, and comply fully with the terms of the Lomé Peace Agreement (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-777.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/777</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">"The Security Council considers Mr. Foday Sankoh, as leader of the RUF, to be responsible for these actions, which are unacceptable and in clear violation of their obligations under the Lomé Agreement. The Council condemns the fact that Mr. Sankoh has deliberately failed to fulfil his responsibility to cooperate with UNAMSIL in bringing these incidents to an end. The Council believes that he must be held accountable, together with the perpetrators, for their actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">"The Security Council commends UNAMSIL forces and the Force Commander for the courage, resolve and sacrifice they have shown in attempting to bring this situation under control. It expresses its full support for their continued efforts to this end, and for the overall fulfilment of their mandate. It calls upon all States in a position to do so to assist the Mission in this regard. The Council also expresses its support for the regional and other international efforts under way to resolve the crisis, including by the Economic Community of West African States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">"The Security Council will continue to monitor the situation closely and consider further actions, as necessary."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2000-14.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2000/14</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa13">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
