	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to His Excellency Mr. Alexander Konuzin, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2004-541.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2004/541</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 1 July 2004 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism, transmitting the Committee's work programme for its twelfth 90-day period, covering July to September 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">At this meeting, the Security Council will hear a briefing by Mr. Alexander Konuzin, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism. I now give him the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Konuzin</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I am very pleased to address the Security Council today in my capacity as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in order to brief the Council on the Committee's activities and to submit for the Council's consideration the Committee's twelfth work programme, for the next 90-day period, from 1 July to 30 September 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">As the Council knows, I assumed the position of Chairman of the CTC at the end of May, succeeding Ambassador Arias of Spain. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to express once again our gratitude and appreciation for the effective leadership and great creativity which Ambassador Arias demonstrated throughout his 13 months at the head of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I would also like to introduce Mr. Javier Rupérez of Spain, who has been appointed Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. He has already started practical planning work aimed at consolidating the new structure. I am confident that under his leadership the Executive Directorate will effectively support the activities of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Before presenting the twelfth work programme, I shall refer to the implementation of the CTC's previous work programme. The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a> on 26 March marked the start of the important process of revitalization. Since that time, the major challenge for the Committee has been the maintenance of an effective balance between reform efforts and the Committee's short-term activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">During this new stage of its work, the CTC has continued to monitor implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, relying on reports submitted by States in response to the letters addressed to them by the Committee. It should be noted that during this transitional period the CTC could not avoid a slowdown in the review of reports. Of 65 reports planned for review from 1 April to 30 June 2004, only 25 were actually completed. Nevertheless, the Committee has taken all possible measures to accelerate the process and to overcome the delay.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">At the same time, the CTC has detected that the approach to this work also needs to be changed. The analysis of country assessments of assistance needs should be integrated into the review process as one of its major elements. That task was highlighted in the Committee's previous, eleventh work programme, but practical work did not begin until last month. Assessments of that kind could be instrumental in developing practical cooperation with donor countries and organizations and in ensuring that the global technical assistance efforts are better adjusted to real needs. The Committee will continue to work in line with that approach.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">Encouraging States to become parties to the relevant conventions and protocols related to terrorism, and to implement their provisions in their national legislation, has remained one of the priorities in the Committee's work. Through the efforts of the CTC, the number of States joining the international conventions related to terrorism has increased, making an important contribution to the strengthening of the international legal basis for the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">During the Chairman of the Committee's early-July briefing to interested delegations, the report on the current status of ratification of the 12 conventions and on the role in that process of the CTC itself were presented. We will continue to engage in regular monitoring of the process of ratification and implementation of the conventions, and will encourage States to join the treaties as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">In the area of technical assistance, the Committee has continued to pursue its work with Member States, in order to develop an approach that is better adjusted to their needs. The Committee has also continued to develop the Directory of Counter-Terrorism Information and Sources of Assistance as an information tool on best practices, model laws and assistance programmes. However, the Directory alone cannot meet the new requirements. The Committee intends to assume a more active role in coordinating the provision of technical assistance, particularly through the new formats of direct dialogue with Member States, both in New York and in capitals, and of information exchange with the donor community. We will take all necessary measures to promote that process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">With regard to transparency, the Committee resumed the practice of regular briefings by the Chairman for interested delegations. A briefing on the CTC's current activities was held on 2 July 2004. It was attended by more than 50 delegations. At the same time, we should recognize that the Committee web site has not been regularly updated. Furthermore, experience has proven that the Committee's outreach efforts have been inadequate to its tasks at this stage of revitalization. That lack of public awareness about the CTC's activities may have led to some misperceptions about the Committee's work, adding to the problems of communication and practical cooperation with Member States. The Committee will therefore continue its efforts to improve its communication methods.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The Committee has continued to develop cooperation and coordination with international, regional and subregional organizations. During the eleventh 90-day period, the Committee's experts participated in many international conferences and seminars concerning various aspects of counter-terrorism. Briefings to the Committee by a number of international organizations and bodies -- including the European Union and the Anti-Terrorism Centre of the Commonwealth of Independent States -- provided the CTC with very important information on their experiences with and approaches to international cooperation against terrorism. They also offered an opportunity to evaluate the capacity of those organizations to be involved in the process of technical assistance and information exchange.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">Let me now draw the Council's attention to the general features of the twelfth report, which covers the period from July to September 2004. By 30 June 2004, the Committee had received 515 reports from Member States and others. That included 160 second reports from Member States and two from others, as well as 116 third, and 40 fourth, reports from Member States. Nevertheless, by 30 June 2004, 71 States had not met the deadline for submission of their respective reports. I should like to take this opportunity to remind the representatives of those States that they should submit their outstanding reports as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">We are open to every possible means of cooperation and dialogue with Member States in order to assist them to solve the problems that caused the delay in the submission of their reports. The review of reports from Member States will remain a key element of the CTC's activities. The Committee will also continue to call upon States to meet the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as well as to support them in doing so.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">The Committee's main task during the twelfth 90-day period is the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>. On 29 June, Ambassador Javier Rupérez took office as Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED). In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, within the next 30 days, the Executive Director is to submit to the Committee an organizational plan for the CTED. Ambassador Rupérez has started consultations about the draft plan with members of the CTC. We expect to consider the draft plan in late July, and to present it to the Security Council for its endorsement. Pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, the Secretary-General will then take the appropriate steps to implement the plan on an expedited basis, including, at the appropriate time, by seeking General Assembly approval.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">The Committee will pursue the course of closer coordination with United Nations bodies dealing with various aspects of the fight against terrorism. First of all, we plan to strengthen cooperation between the CTC and the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Those issues have already been discussed at an informal meeting between the Chairs of the two Committees, and we have agreed on some forms of cooperation. As the contacts between our Committees develop, we will be ready to consider further coordination measures. The CTC will also seek appropriate working contacts with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> concerning non-proliferation problems in the context of the terrorist threat.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">With regard to technical assistance, we shall continue the work on country assessments of assistance needs, bearing in mind the need to create an effective mechanism to share non-classified information with potential donors. The CTC intends to cooperate with the Counter-Terrorism Action Group of the Group of Eight, and plans to discuss information exchanges with the Action Group that will open the way for the most effective use of the donor community. In order to build an effective and flexible system of technical assistance, the Committee is exploring new types of activities. The Committee will analyse the possibilities of establishing more effective contacts between the CTC and donor countries and organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">As provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, the Committee intends to begin preparations for its first visit to a Member State, subject to its consent, in order to engage in direct dialogue with its authorities in the context of ensuring effective monitoring of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Such a mission is essential to the purpose of creating a climate of cooperation and of providing technical assistance based on more accurate assessments of countries' needs. We plan to invite representatives of participating international organizations to join the mission. Such monitoring missions could be instrumental in providing direct assistance, adjusted to identified needs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">Pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Committee will develop all necessary forms of direct dialogue with Member States seeking assistance in strengthening their capacities to combat terrorism. Along with traditional contacts between interested countries and the CTC's subcommittees, whereby countries may raise questions related to the letters sent by the CTC in response to their reports, we intend to explore new approaches to communicating with States. As Chairman of the Committee, I should like to take this opportunity to say that we would welcome messages sent to the CTC and its experts, Bureau, subcommittees, Vice-Chairmen and Chairman with proposals on how to improve its work, questions on participation and requests for donor assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">The CTC should not be viewed as some kind of inquisition. On the contrary, we deem it necessary to develop the friendliest relationships with States. The Russian Chair will attempt to ensure that cooperation between the CTC and States Members of the United Nations develops in the most effective manner and is open in nature. In keeping with the principle of transparency, the Chairman of the Committee will continue to hold briefings for interested delegations on the CTC's activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">The development of cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations will remain a priority of the CTC's work. The League of Arab States has offered to host the Committee's next meeting with international organizations in Cairo later this year, and the Committee has accepted the offer. Following the approach agreed by the Committee and the procedures followed at previous such meetings, the CTC plans to start preparations for the meeting, to be held in November and December 2004. The meeting will be open to all States Members of the United Nations for participation as observers. We expect it to contribute to a focused and action-oriented dialogue with international, regional and subregional organizations, as well as regional States, on the main problems encountered in the practical implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and in international cooperation in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">We are open to criticism, suggestions and remarks from States members of the Security Council and other Members of the United Nations, which I am sure will contribute to the CTC's progress at the current stage of its revitalization. I invite participants to pose any questions they may have.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Danforth</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I am sure I join with all members in thanking Ambassador Konuzin for his report to us this morning and also in congratulating him and his staff on their work since assuming the chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in May.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I would also like to welcome Javier Rupérez, the Executive Director of the newly established Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED), to his first Council meeting. The establishment of that body marks a watershed moment in the Council's effort to deal with the menacing threat to international peace and security that is terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The global campaign against terrorism remains the highest of priorities for my Government. The United States is committed to seeing that the United Nations continues to play an important role in this area, and my Government is working to find ways to enhance the United Nations effectiveness. It will require a team effort to defeat the scourge of terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Committee has been a valuable member of that team. Through its capacity-building work and its global coordination initiatives, the Committee has helped to energize member States and organizations around the world to make the fight against terrorism more of a priority, be it through the adoption of new or the improvement of existing counter-terrorism laws or enforcement mechanisms.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">As a result of its work, more organizations and countries have joined the counter-terrorism team. Nevertheless, much work remains to be done. For example, while we have seen a significant increase in the number of States that have become parties to the 12 international counter-terrorism conventions and protocols, there are still too many that have failed to take action in this area. Some 40 States are parties to fewer than half of those instruments. This suggests a lack of urgency in fighting terrorism and weakens international solidarity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Although the CTC has received more than 500 reports from member States, compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> requires much more than the submission of reports. Compliance requires action on various fronts -- the legislative, the regulatory and the operational. The CTC needs to do a better job of reinforcing that point, both in New York and in capitals. Perhaps the clearest indication of just how much more needs to be done is the number of major terrorist attacks since the CTC opened its doors for business in October 2001. Simply put, the terrorists and their supporters have continued to strike, be it in Bali, Moscow, Casablanca, Riyadh, Baghdad, Mombassa, Istanbul, Haifa, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem or Madrid. Terrorism has not been defeated, raising the spectre of further deadly attacks on innocent victims and continuing threats to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The Council established the CTED to strengthen the CTC and provide it with additional tools and resources. Now we must work to ensure that the CTED becomes operational as quickly as possible. The CTED will enable the CTC to be more proactive, to reach out in different ways to States and organizations and to encourage more of them to become full partners on the counter-terrorism team. Through field visits to different States, it will be able to help the CTC assess on-the-ground efforts to implement the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, thus moving beyond the current focus on written reports. This is essential if the CTC eventually hopes to gather enough information to determine which States are in compliance with the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">In addition, we encourage those States that have asked for technical assistance to consider requesting a visit from the CTC and the CTED. Even with the work of those bodies and that of the Council's other counter-terrorism body, the Al Qaeda-Taliban sanctions Committee, the Council itself must remain at the forefront of the global campaign to rid the world of the scourge of terrorism. It must act with a sense of urgency, as though the events of 11 March 2004 and 11 September 2001 had taken place yesterday, not months or years ago. It must never forget that, so long as a few States are not acting quickly enough to raise their capacity to fight terrorism or are not meeting their international counter-terrorism obligations, all of us remain vulnerable.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">The Council must be prepared to live up to its responsibility under the United Nations Charter to maintain international peace and security.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">First of all, I should like to express my gratitude for the comprehensive briefing given us by Ambassador Alexander Konuzin, in his capacity as Chairman of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), concerning the activities of the Committee, and also for his presentation of the twelfth work programme from the period from July to September, which we fully support.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The CTC has this year, through its revitalization, entered into a new and special phase, aimed at enhancing its working capacity and at tackling the challenges relating to the full implementation by Member States of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Last March we supported the proposals to revitalize the Committee and voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>. In the light of the information we have received today, we are pleased to see that the consensus will of the members of the Council has gradually been translated into reality. Proof of this is our welcoming today of Ambassador Javier Rupérez, who has been appointed Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. We wish him every success in his work, and we assure him of the fullest support of the Chilean delegation as he carries out his important functions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">As regards the achievement of the objectives set out in the most recent three-month work programme, we welcome the Committee's capacity for self-criticism, as reflected in the report, and also the plainly stated intention and resolve to modify certain procedures that will in future make possible the full achievement of the goals that have been set in the area of the verification and monitoring of the implementation by States of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In that vein, we deem very important the work done so far with respect to the scheduling and organization of the work of the CTED.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Along those lines, and in keeping with the mandate of the sanctions Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban, which I am chairing, and determined to enhance the cooperation between that Committee and the CTC, we have, in recent days, held an informal meeting between the Chairmen of both Committees to discuss and examine ways and means of exploring and establishing new areas of cooperation and coordination between them.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">As Ambassador Konuzin has said, these include in particular the intention of holding regular meetings, as part of our usual programme of work, among the two Chairmen and among the experts charged with dealing with those issues. We have also considered the possibility of the Chairmen of the Committees' participating in one another's meetings. We have also looked at ways of promoting and fostering contacts between the Monitoring Group of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and the Panel of Experts of the CTC, so as to exchange information and share experiences, in accordance with the rules of procedures of both Committees and the agreements adopted therein.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">We have also looked at ways of passing on the information that the Al Qaeda Committee regularly receives with respect to the need for technical assistance, which is gathered during contact visits by the States holding the chairmanship and the members of the 1267 Committee. In short, we have looked at ways of enhancing cooperation between the two bodies, and we will continue to do so in future.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">I should also like to say that combating terrorism involves constancy, dedication and perseverance in our cooperation efforts in order to achieve our objectives, as well as integration of efforts and actions -- all of this in the context of the work of the Security Council committees on this issue, in particular in the CTC. All of this has led to some important achievements.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">However, as was recently stated in the Council, terrorism still poses a major threat to international peace and security. This is clear, as we learn daily of new terrorist acts being perpetrated in various parts of the world, in both developed and developing countries. Therefore we need to uphold the Council's goal of continuing to combat this grave threat. This can be achieved only through the necessary and fundamental cooperation of States and of the competent organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">For that reason, it is necessary and timely to reiterate our appeal to those States that are not yet parties to international conventions relating to counter-terrorism to do so, and to enact the necessary legislation to implement them, and also, as regards the Committee that I have the honour to chair, they must comply with the sanctions imposed by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">Lastly, bearing in mind the renewed efforts made by the Security Council this year to combat terrorism -- as evidenced by the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a> aimed at strengthening the work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban; <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, which set up the Executive Directorate of the CTC; and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> on non-State actors and weapons of mass destruction -- we, as the international community, must remain committed to this effort and take this opportunity to move forward in the combat against terrorism. In that way we will help ensure that the people of all States can live in peace, in adequate security, with respect for human, individual and collective rights, and in full adherence to the rule of law.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I should first like to extend our congratulations to Ambassador Konuzin for chairing the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and to Ambassador Rupérez on his appointment as Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED). I wish also to thank Ambassador Konuzin for his comprehensive report on the activities of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We welcome this opportunity for the Council to take stock of its counter-terrorism efforts through the CTC. The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a> proves that the Council is sensitive to the need, and is willing to accept change, to improve its efforts in the area of counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">We express appreciation for the draft plan that Ambassador Rupérez has prepared for the organization of the CTED, and for his openness to views and suggestions regarding the plan.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">I would like to make two comments. First, the report states that 71 countries have not met the deadline for the submission of their respective reports. That is a matter for concern. That phenomenon must be examined as a serious symptom of a possible bigger problem. When 71 of 191 members are lagging behind in complying with Council-imposed deadlines, we should ask why. We should determine the cause of this acute problem and find a remedy for it.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Do those States required more technical assistance than the CTC is able to facilitate? Has the CTC system of monitoring compliance with reports and letters reached the point of diminishing returns? Do we need to consider putting greater emphasis on other types of engagement with other States, such as direct dialogue, as the Chairman has suggested? Or, more ominously, do States have issues with the legitimacy of the methods of the CTC such that they are now deciding to ignore them?</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The second point concerns the relationship between counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights. We reiterate our view that there is a need to incorporate human rights concerns into the global counter-terrorism struggle. Counter-terrorism measures could pose dangers to established human rights protections. Rights violations could undermine the success of counter-terrorism efforts in countries. We hope that the CTED and the CTC will add a human rights component to their structure and their methods.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The global effort against terrorism requires the Security Council and the rest of the Members of the United Nations to remain committed partners to both concerns if success is to be achieved in eradicating the scourge of terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">We thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Konuzin, for his detailed and substantial report. My delegation would like to join others in congratulating him -- as well as his team -- on having taken up his important office.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">We also welcome the presence of the new Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, Ambassador Javier Rupérez. He will, in our view, play a crucial role in setting up the CTC's new support structure in the months to come. We would like to assure him of our full support in that important and difficult task. We are confident that he will always be guided by the CTC's key objective, that is, to enhance the ongoing dialogue with all United Nations Member States in the spirit of cooperation, transparency and even-handedness.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">In addition to improving the CTC's operative structures, the ongoing revitalization must preserve and further strengthen the CTC's legitimacy in the perception of all United Nations Member States. We are therefore looking forward to seeing an expert on human rights and the rule of law included in the senior staff of the Executive Directorate. In this respect we fully share the views just expressed by Ambassador Baja.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The Executive Directorate will also offer increased possibilities for further intensifying the CTC's cooperation and coordination with other United Nations bodies, in particular with the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Important steps have already been taken in that respect by the two Committees: by the two Chairmen and by the current expert teams. We feel that they all deserve our full recognition, and we will continue to support the improvement of their important work.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">Let me conclude by affirming that Germany fully subscribes to the statement to be made later by Ambassador van den Berg on behalf of the Dutch presidency of the European Union.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chaudhry</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">We congratulate the Russian Federation on having assumed the chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), thank the outgoing Chairman, Ambassador Arias, for his outstanding contribution, and welcome Ambassador Rupérez, the new Executive Director of the CTC Executive Directorate (CTED).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">We would also like to thank Ambassador Konuzin for having presented to the Council the twelfth work programme (see <a href="../pdf/S-2004-541.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/541</a>), and to express appreciation for his leadership role in guiding the work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The CTC is going through a transitional phase aimed at its revitalization. We look forward to the finalization of the organizational plan of the CTED. In that regard, we share the view that the Committee will need to maintain a balance between reform efforts and its short-term activities. We agree with the need, as expressed by the Chairman, for the Committee to play a more active role in coordinating the provision of technical assistance. In that context, the integration of the analysis of country assessments of assistance needs into the review process should be done in an objective manner.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">On the question of reporting, while emphasizing the need for the timely submission of reports, the Committee should also try to address issues such as reporting fatigue, technical capacity for rendering such reports and other areas on which Ambassador Baja also touched.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We have noted the efforts of the Chairman to pursue closer coordination with other United Nations structures dealing with various aspects of counter-terrorism. However, we understand that such coordination will be pursued within the respective mandates of the Committee and other United Nations structures.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We have noted the Committee's intention to begin preparations for the first visit by the CTC to a Member State, subject to its consent. Such visits should lead to the creation of a climate of cooperation and to the provision of technical assistance, as pointed out by the Chairman in his statement today.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">We support activities aimed at improving communication between the Committee and Member States so as to enhance the capacity of States to fight terrorism more effectively. We also share the view that the Committee needs to improve its communication methods to promote transparency and avoid misperceptions about its work. We look forward to the meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations to be hosted by the League of Arab States later this year.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. King</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">We are grateful to you, Mr. President, for having convened this meeting, and to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Like others, we would like to take this opportunity to offer our best wishes to the new Chairman of the CTC, Ambassador Konuzin of Russia, and to the new Executive Director of the CTC Executive Directorate, Ambassador Rupérez. The United Kingdom subscribes to the statement to be made shortly by the Netherlands on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The threat of terrorism remains as acute today as it has ever been. Terrorists are tireless in their pursuit of impossible goals. They know no distinctions of race, religion or geography. They are united in the disdain they show for innocent life. So, we must be united in combating terrorism -- from tackling terrorist funding to tackling the resentments that encourage terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Since its creation, the CTC has achieved a good deal. It has helped build unity among States in the fight against terrorism. It has helped sustain the momentum of the international community's efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It has made States accountable for their counter-terrorism efforts and, crucially, it has assisted States in those efforts. But more needs to be done, and, frankly speaking, there has been a sense that activity has been levelling off a little as time has gone on.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">So now we need to exploit the appointment of the new Executive Director and the reinforcement of the CTC Executive Directorate to take activity to a new level. We should take this opportunity to review how the CTC works. It should maintain the best traditions of efficiency and effectiveness; it should continue to promote transparency, equal treatment and cooperation with regional organizations. And the new structure should also enable it to develop stronger links with other parts of the United Nations system -- notably the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights -- allowing the CTC to draw them more closely into its work and to draw on their expertise, authority and contacts. The CTC should continue and develop its close cooperation with the Al Qaeda and Taliban sanctions Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">It is also right that we take this opportunity to review what the CTC should do. We should look at what more the CTC could do to provide technical expertise to Member States. We welcome plans for an additional effort to build links with potential donors of assistance and better to match Member States' needs and requirements with available assistance. The CTC should continue to produce focused, proportional judgements, building on appropriate reporting requirements of Member States. And we should look at the possibility of regional reporting returns so that some smaller States could focus scarce resources on implementation rather than on reporting requirements. As a number of speakers have already noted this morning, we should also look again at how best to work with, and deal with, those who have not reported or responded to the CTC. That will be a key issue for the next period.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">The bottom line is that terrorism remains an ongoing threat which no one can ignore. We must all play our part within and beyond the United Nations to reduce that risk.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to express my appreciation for the detailed briefing presented by Ambassador Alexander Konuzin of the Russian Federation on behalf of the Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). I am pleased also to congratulate him on his election as Chairman of the Committee, a position he is assuming from my predecessor as Permanent Representative of Spain, Ambassador Inocencio Arias. I am very grateful for Ambassador Konuzin's comments on that subject. I am sure that, under such efficient leadership, the Committee will be able to effectively meet the challenges facing it.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">I also wish to warmly welcome the first Executive Director of the CTC Executive Directorate, Ambassador Javier Rupérez. Not only is he a compatriot of mine and a colleague of many years' standing in the Spanish foreign service, but we also have shared ideals and aspirations in the fight for freedom, democracy and human rights and have worked together for peace and security in Europe and around the world. That is why we have every confidence in his effectiveness in his work, which will have the full support of my delegation and myself.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">Spain attaches particular importance to these open Security Council debates as a mechanism for strengthening transparency, with which the Counter-Terrorism Committee has always carried out its work. That is why we welcome the continued holding of these debates, which provide the Committee and its member States with a platform from which to inform all United Nations Member States and the general public about its work, while providing non-Council-member States a forum in which to express to us their viewpoints on these matters. Therefore, I shall be very brief, precisely to expedite the exchange of views among all of us. I take this opportunity to say that we subscribe fully to the statement to be made shortly by the representative of the Netherlands on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">My delegation joins Ambassador Konuzin in identifying three objectives, or immediate challenges, facing the Counter-Terrorism Committee. The first is strengthening the role played by the Committee with regard to technical assistance to States for implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> so that it can become a true global promoter and coordinator of such assistance. Among other things, that should be a concrete way to overcome the current situation, in which -- as was been explained to us -- as many as 71 countries have failed to submit their respective reports on time.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">The second objective is preparing for the Committee's first visits to States that they deem it necessary to visit, with the consent of their respective Governments, to engage in direct dialogue with the competent authorities. That will enable us to verify effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on the ground, to evaluate the nature of the causes that hamper such effective implementation and to identify possible needs or offers of technical assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">The last objective is strengthening the Committee's cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations whose experience with and diverse approaches to counter-terrorism are an essential contribution to ensuring that the Committee can properly monitor the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We believe that such inter-institutional cooperation should begin with better interaction and coordination with other United Nations structures involved in the fight against terrorism, first and foremost the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">Precisely to assist the Committee as it faces those immediate challenges, Spain promoted a revitalization process that was ultimately reflected in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, whose main result has been the creation of the Executive Directorate, headed by Ambassador Rupérez. My delegation wishes to congratulate him on the draft programme of work he has prepared for the Executive Directorate -- a programme of work that we fully support. We hope that its provisions can be adopted and implemented as swiftly as possible so that the Executive Directorate can become operational very soon and so that the Committee's revitalization can begin to materialize. That will be the most effective way to attain the objectives set by the Security Council in the global fight against all forms of terrorism, which jeopardize international peace and security.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zhang Yishan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">First of all, I should like to thank Ambassador Konuzin, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for his briefing. With Ambassador Konuzin as Chairman, I believe we can have every confidence in the work done by the CTC. I support the points he made in his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">I would like to make three very brief comments. First, we support reform of the CTC, and we welcome Ambassador Rupérez as the new Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED). We hope that, through the efforts of the CTED and the Secretariat, the Directorate will soon get down to work.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Secondly, China supports the visit by the CTC to a Member State to gather information on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in order to assess the need for assistance in combating terrorism. China hopes that the visit will help ease the burden on Member States in submitting their reports to the CTC by giving them more time to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">Thirdly, we greatly appreciate the offer by the League of Arab States to host what will be the fourth special meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations. The League of Arab States' holding of the upcoming special meeting will be an opportunity to show the resolve of the Arab world to combine its efforts to combat terrorism and to demonstrate that all Member States share the common cause of combating terrorism. That can only be beneficial to the common cause of the international fight against terrorism. We are certain that the League of Arab States will duly complete the preparatory work that will make the event a success.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baali</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I thank Ambassador Alexander Konuzin for his excellent presentation of the 90-day work programme of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and for his efforts to enable the Committee to fulfil its mandate at a time of transition, when the Executive Directorate is being put into place. I take this opportunity once again to extend our congratulations to Mr. Javier Rupérez on his appointment as Executive Director and to assure him of our full cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">I would like briefly to underline a few elements of the programme of work under consideration that I consider to be important. First, we hope that the CTC will be able to meet the deadline for adopting the organizational plan of the Executive Directorate in order to submit it to the Security Council for approval. This will enable the new executive body to become operational and to carry out the tasks entrusted to it.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">We also believe that it is highly desirable to maintain the cooperation between the CTC and the Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee and to develop new forms of such cooperation, while fully respecting the mandates of the two Committees.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">We encourage the CTC to continue its work of assessing the assistance needs of countries. The visits of CTC experts to certain countries, with their consent and in accordance with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, will help to strengthen monitoring of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to establish direct dialogue with the Governments of the States concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">For that reason, we support and encourage the CTC as it begins preparations for the first of its intended visits. Those visits require good preparation and a clear and precise road map with respect to the objectives to be achieved. They respond to the CTC's wish to verify on the ground the implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and should be carried out without discrimination of any kind, in every region, regardless of civilization, cultural or religious background.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">We note that 71 countries have failed to report in a timely fashion. We urge those countries to fulfil their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and we encourage the Committee to explore all ways and means of assisting those States so that they can submit their reports. In particular, the Committee should reflect on ways to communicate, engage in dialogue and interact with Member States in order to ensure their cooperation, rather then limiting interaction to the mere exchange of correspondence, which is starting to show its limitations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">We support the CTC in its preparatory efforts with the League of Arab States for the meeting, planned to be held in Cairo in December. The successful holding of that meeting would certainly send a strong signal from the international community with respect to the fight against terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I would like to start by congratulating Ambassador Alexander Konuzin on assuming the chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee at a particularly delicate moment, when the revitalization process is under way. We also welcome and congratulate Ambassador Javier Rupérez on his appointment as Executive Director of the newly formed Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, which will be a central piece in the revitalization process that the Committee is going through. We assure Mr. Rupérez of our full cooperation and wish him every success in the discharge of his responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">My delegation took due note of the briefing to the Council by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. In that connection, we would like briefly to underline three issues.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">First, the process of revitalizing the CTC, to which the Security Council and the United Nations membership at large are committed, is intended to strengthen the prominent and central role of the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. It shows how Member States are determined to overcome any difficulty that might hinder universal implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">The report of the Chairman on difficulties encountered by the CTC and by States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-70.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/70</a>, annex); the report of the CTC on its revitalization (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-124.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/124</a>, annex); and the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>: all these reflect the international community's resolve to adapt the fight against terrorism to changing circumstances and its flexibility to adapt structures to make them best suited for effectively responding to such an enormous challenge.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">Secondly, the twelfth work programme (<a href="../pdf/S-2004-541.pdf" class="pdf">S/2004/541</a>, annex), presented by the CTC Chairman, shows how the CTC is beginning a new and important phase of its existence. It states that the main task for the current period of work is to render fully operational as soon as possible the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, with a view -- as stated in the CTC's report on its revitalization -- to enabling the CTC to fulfil its mandate of monitoring implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, facilitating technical assistance to Member States and promoting closer cooperation and coordination with international, regional and subregional organizations: functions which are crucial to the fight against terrorism and to the central role that the United Nations plays in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, the briefing by the CTC refers to the need to change the approach to monitoring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which now relies on reports submitted by States, by integrating country assessments of assistance needs into the process of reviewing the reports as a means to develop practical cooperation with donor countries and to better adapt technical assistance efforts to the real needs of the countries. The fact that by 30 June 70 States had not met the deadline for the submission of their respective reports, and the fact that all of them are developing countries, is a clear demonstration of the urgent need to step up efforts to provide technical assistance to those countries, which are also the most vulnerable to the presence of terrorists and their acts.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">We are pleased that the CTC, in its approach to revitalization, is looking for innovative ways so as to make technical assistance, capacity-building and the upgrading of States' anti-terrorist capabilities the main thrust of international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. That is indeed a commendable development.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">An important provision of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a> recognized the need for the Committee to visit States and to engage in a dialogue as part of the monitoring of the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We consider of very crucial importance the fact that the Committee has undertaken to develop all necessary forms of direct dialogue with the Member States seeking assistance in order to strengthen their capacity to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, we fully support the statement that the President will deliver as the outcome of this meeting. It clearly sets out the tasks ahead for the Committee, as well as those carried out in the quarterly period under consideration.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Konuzin, for his comprehensive presentation of the work of the Committee, as foreseen in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>. As a member of the Bureau of that Committee, I wish to associate myself with his words, which will help to shorten considerably my comments this morning. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Executive Director of the newly established Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), Ambassador Javier Rupérez of Spain. I wish him well in his new job.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The most relevant challenge facing the CTC and the CTED is to persuade countries that it is in their own interest to take advantage of the various sources of cooperation made available to them. It is our view that, up to now, the potential for cooperation with the CTC is underused. It is not our objective this morning to exhaust the reasons why the results have been so, but one issue to which we would like to draw attention is the lack of stronger feedback mechanisms to ensure that the cooperation provided by third parties to countries and to the CTC is fully satisfactory.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">We also wish to stress that the CTC and the CTED are structures designed mainly to shelter States that are willing to cooperate but, for various reasons, are unable to do so. We would therefore like to reiterate that the CTC and, by extension, the CTED, is neither a sanctions committee nor a court of justice -- not even a police precinct. The work of the Committee is to be carried out within the limits foreseen in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1535 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The sense of ownership of what is being done by the Committee should be strengthened among other United Nations members. In that regard, the establishment of direct contact with Member States in fulfilment of the work of the Committee is a most useful working method. We especially welcome all efforts to bring transparency to the work of the CTC. When it comes to cooperation, creative solutions are always in order.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">In conclusion, I wish to note that the repudiation of terrorist acts is one of the guiding principles of Brazilian foreign policy. We are of the view that the fight against terrorism is to be conducted within the requirements of due process, human rights and civil liberties.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">At this stage, I wish to make a brief statement in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">I would like to join others in thanking Ambassador Konuzin for his highly informative and comprehensive presentation, in congratulating him for his assumption of the chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and in wishing him every success in his undertaking. I would also like to welcome the presence here of the newly appointed Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), Ambassador Javier Rupérez, to whom I wish every success in his work.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">As Romania aligns itself with the statement to be delivered shortly by Ambassador van den Berg of the Netherlands on behalf of the European Union, I will confine myself only to a few brief comments.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">Following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>, through which the CTED was established, the CTC has now entered into a transitional phase that will end at the moment the CTED becomes fully operational. It is of the utmost importance that the CTC continue to work at the same pace throughout that period, while also continuing to adapt itself to the new dynamics of the global fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">As the CTC's ability to monitor the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> remains an essential prerequisite to effectively combating terrorism, we note with concern that many States are still facing significant difficulties in fully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. One relevant indicator in that respect is the continuously increasing number of States that are late in submitting their reports. It is for that reason that we believe that effectively addressing countries' assistance needs -- including through a more practically oriented dialogue with both the donor community and interested States -- should be one of the Committee's top priorities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">We recognize the importance of strengthening cooperation and coordination between the CTC and international, regional and subregional organizations, as well as with other United Nations bodies. We welcome the active approach adopted by the new Chairman of the CTC in that regard. For Romania's part, I would like to assure Ambassador Konuzin of our full readiness to discuss, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, possible synergies between our two Committees. Given the fact that the 1540 Committee is still in the process of launching its activities, such a step could be considered at a later stage.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Last, but definitely not least, I would like to express my delegation's full support for the work Ambassador Rupérez has already undertaken in putting in place the new structure. We stand ready to bring our active contribution to the finalization of the organizational plan of the Executive Directorate of the CTC and to its timely endorsement by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">I now resume my function as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the Netherlands. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. van den Berg</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union. The candidate countries of Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Croatia; the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro; and the European Free Trade Association countries of Norway and Iceland, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">The European Union (EU) wishes to express its appreciation for the briefing provided to us this morning by Ambassador Konuzin, the new Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), whom we greet and congratulate on his election. We are confident that, with Russia as Chair, effective coordination of the CTC will continue. Furthermore, we are pleased to greet the new Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Ambassador Javier Rupérez. The European Union also thanks Ambassador Arias for his able chairmanship of the CTC during the 13 months of its work.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">The European Union attaches great importance to these periodic open debates and we are happy that this tradition is being continued under the new leadership and management. The regular open debates help to maintain and strengthen the general acceptance and legitimacy of the CTC within the United Nations family. We are also pleased to note that Ambassador Konuzin has continued the informal briefings for member States, the first of which took place on 2 July. This possibility for direct questions and answers is much appreciated. The Chairman was perfectly right in affirming that transparency should continue to be a hallmark of the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Today's meeting deals with the Committee's work programme for the twelfth 90-day period, which covers the months from July to September 2004. The European Union welcomes this document as part of the process of revitalization of the CTC pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1535 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The Executive Director will soon submit the organizational plan for the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. It is good to learn from the work programme that this will happen through the Secretary-General. That is important to show that the revitalization process should honour the Secretary-General in his role as the chief administrative officer of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">As the European Union considers respect for human rights and the rule of law to be a fundamental condition for overcoming the scourge of terrorism, we hope to see a human rights expert included in the Executive Directorate. Furthermore, the European Union welcomes the further strengthening of cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban. We also hope that such a strengthening of cooperation will extend to other parts of the United Nations system involved in counter-terrorism, in particular the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">The European Union supports your call, Sir, to all States that have not submitted their reports on time to do so as soon as possible. The number of 71 States missing deadlines means that more than one third of the membership is lagging behind. We must maintain the universality and the speed of the response which <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> requires.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">We encourage the Committee and its Executive Directorate to enhance their dialogue with member States with a view to approaching our common goal to fully and universally implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The European Council is squarely behind those efforts and has appointed an EU counter-terrorism coordinator. Combating terrorism is now fully integrated into the external relations policy of the EU and a key element in the EU political dialogue with other States. Particular emphasis is put on ratification without reservation and effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and protocols related to terrorism and preventing the financing of terrorism. Emphasis is also put on addressing other factors that may contribute to the fight against terrorism, such as non-proliferation and arms control. We applaud the new energy the CTC is willing to put into that effort to make the relevant conventions and protocols universal and we look forward to enhancing its results by our own contribution. The CTC objectives in this field are our own.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">The European Union understands that the CTC is in transition and that this has led to a slow-down in the review of reports. We hope and trust that, with an extended staff of experts, the CTC will be able to accelerate its work. More staff should also allow for better assessing the assistance needs of those countries that have the sincere political will to fully implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> but lack the proper tools to do so. We share the Chairman's view that review and remedy should be more effectively linked.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">In this context, the European Union would welcome a more proactive role of the CTC in the field of technical assistance. We would welcome more direct dialogue and information exchange with both the States in need of assistance and the donor community, including close dialogue and cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Action Group of the G-8.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">Direct dialogue and information exchange on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> as such are also essential and we are convinced that such dialogue and exchange could be enhanced by in-country visits made by the CTC to States with the concerned State's consent. The first such visit by the CTC to a State with its consent, as envisaged in the new work programme, is important to mention in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">We commend the fact that the League of Arab States has offered to co-host, jointly with the CTC, the fourth special meeting with international, regional and subregional organizations on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in Cairo later this year. A focused and action-oriented dialogue at that event should provide a useful follow-up to the three previous similar meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">Finally, allow me to make a pitch for the seminar that the EU presidency is planning to organize on 22 September in Brussels on ways to combat the financing of terrorism. We will concentrate on various issues, such as alternative remittance systems, money laundering and national and regional implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We stand ready to inform those interested.</p>

	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">At the outset, my delegation would like to congratulate you, Sir, on presiding over the Security Council this month. We also wish to thank the Permanent Representative of the Philippines and his mission staff for their successful leadership of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">My delegation also takes this opportunity to congratulate the representative of the Russian Federation, Mr. Alexander Konuzin, on his chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We thank him for his detailed and comprehensive briefing this morning, in which he provided the Committee's programme of work for the next 90-day period.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">We also congratulate Ambassador Javier Rupérez of Spain on his appointment as Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">My delegation commends the work and efforts of the CTC during the period under consideration. The Committee strove tirelessly to enhance the capacities of member States to align their national legislations with the requirements and provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. My delegation also welcomes the Committee's work in creating an open and ongoing dialogue on cooperation and transparency in order to increase the counter-terrorism capacities of member States. In that respect, we commend the interactive and genuine relationship between the Committee and international, regional and subregional organizations, as well as the enhanced contacts with such organizations. We welcome specifically the Committee's acceptance of the League of Arab States' proposal to host the fourth special meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee with regional and subregional organizations, to be held in Cairo later this year, provided that such a meeting is held in accordance with applicable procedures for such meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">My delegation welcomes the establishment of the CTC Executive Directorate, which will work in cooperation with the newly appointed Executive Director and the Secretariat to enable this new organ to begin work as soon as possible. We note in the Committee's work schedule the fact that it will consider the organizational plan to be submitted by the Executive Director. In that respect, we are confident that members of the Council will discuss the plan in detail to ensure that it is in keeping with the Charter of the United Nations, other principles of the Organization and the mandate of the Committee. We also hope that they will discuss its financial aspects in the light of the financial rules and regulations of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">International terrorism has reached a very dangerous stage, and combating it requires coordinated international efforts. To uproot it, we must seriously address its causes and roots. Such an approach should be implemented objectively, without any double standard, so as to promote international peace and security on the basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">The threat posed by terrorism increases if weapons of mass destruction are involved, and that is why my country has called on the international community to fight both in parallel. As an expression of good faith, my country submitted, during its term as a non-permanent member of the Council, a draft resolution on behalf of the Arab Group calling for making the Middle East a region free from all weapons of mass destruction, with no exceptions for any country in the region. That draft resolution is still before the Council, and we truly hope that it will be unanimously adopted as soon as possible in view of its importance, particularly in the light of the challenges and dangers threatening our world today.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I should like to stress once again my country's support for the CTC and for all sincere international efforts to realize the lofty objective of the international community: to combat terrorism and thereby help to realize humanity's aspiration to peace and security.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk03-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Liechtenstein, to whom I give the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wenaweser</span> <span class="nation">Liechtenstein</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa01">It is a great pleasure, Sir, to see you preside over the Council's meeting this morning. At the outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador Konuzin on his assumption of the chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and to convey to him our best wishes in the discharge of his important task. We thank him in particular for having upheld the principle of transparency during his first weeks in that position, and we are thankful for his intention to continue regularly to brief interested Member States on the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa02">Our congratulations also go to Ambassador Rupérez in his capacity as the new Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) Executive Directorate. We are confident that Ambassador Rupérez will provide the new, enhanced structure with the necessary leadership, and we pledge our full support in that respect. We look forward to receiving the forthcoming organizational plan for the CTC Executive Directorate, and we hope that the Committee will soon be in a position to move on from the transitional arrangements to the new structure, in order to deal with the challenges lying ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa03">We continue to believe that the CTC's greatest strength lies in the field of the coordination of technical assistance, thereby complementing the substantial efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, based in Vienna. As the Committee is making preparations and arrangements for a first State visit, it is important to underline the consensual nature of such technical assistance, as well as the need for a balanced approach integrating human rights concerns. While assessing the assistance needs of States and advising them on necessary action, the CTC and its experts should always be aware, and also actively raise awareness of, the fact that, in the fight against terrorism, respect for human rights and the rule of law is not an impediment to its success, but a necessary precondition.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa04">It is thus crucial that, in the upcoming recruitment process within the Executive Directorate, due consideration be given to any relevant human rights experience of future staff members. We also hope that the new arrangements will include an institutionalized liaison with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa05">In recent months, the Council has stepped up its efforts to deal with the activities of non-State actors that are determined and have the capability to threaten international peace and security. The strengthening of the CTC through the establishment of its new Executive Directorate, including a strong increase in expert capacity; the strengthening of the sanctions regime against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1526(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1526 (2004)</a>; and the adoption of new measures on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of non-State actors, in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>, bear witness to the renewed commitment of Member States to prevent indiscriminate and terrorist attacks against their populations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa06">Those efforts, however, need to be accompanied by improved coordination between the Committees and expert bodies involved, in order to use the available resources in the most efficient manner possible and not to overburden the administrative resources of Member States. Such synergetic effects are especially pertinent between the CTC and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban, as both Committees have developed outstanding capacity and expertise over the last two years.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa07">The consideration of States' reports remains an important pillar of the CTC's work. Liechtenstein is one of the 40-odd countries which have already submitted their fourth report to the Committee. We are thus aware of the considerable burden that increasing reporting requirements place on Member States and on small States in particular. While we encourage the Council and its various sub-organs to take such restraints into account, especially in the adoption of new reporting requirements, States themselves can also take measures to render reporting on interrelated topics more efficient.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa08">The Liechtenstein Government recently adopted a basic document on facts and figures covering Liechtenstein's political, legal, economic and social characteristics, as well as the general framework of international cooperation within which Liechtenstein operates in countering terrorism, crime and money-laundering. Such a basic core document can serve as a point of reference for various reporting requirements and thus considerably alleviate the burden placed on administrations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk04-pa09">Finally, let me once again express Liechtenstein's commitment to international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and to cooperation with the Council, the CTC and other relevant United Nations bodies in this field.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Atiyanto</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation for the convening of this open meeting of the Security Council to review the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) over the past three months. We would like to express our appreciation to Ambassador Konuzin, Chairman of the CTC, for his briefing on the Committee's work programme. We would also like to welcome and congratulate Ambassador Javier Rupérez on his appointment as Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED).</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">We note the Committee's twelfth 90-day work programme, which will run from July to September 2004. It is our belief that the work programme will continue to enhance the effectiveness of our counter-terrorism measures. In this connection, Indonesia supports measures intended to enhance the counter-terrorism capability of States requesting aid and reiterates the importance of cooperation and coordination by United Nations Member States in capacity-building for those States that need assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Allow me to provide an update on Indonesia's continuing efforts in combating international terrorism, especially in our region, since the previous CTC meeting. On 3 July 2004, President Megawati Soekarnoputri inaugurated the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. The establishment of the Centre was an important follow-up to the Bali Regional Ministerial Meeting on Counter-Terrorism that was held on 4 and 5 February 2004, under the co-chairmanship of the Indonesian and Australian Governments.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">The key objective of the Centre is to enhance the operational expertise of regional law-enforcement personnel in dealing with transnational crime, with the primary focus on enhancing counter-terrorism skills. The Centre will seek to strengthen cooperation among regional police forces, drawing upon the experience of Indonesia and Australia in law-enforcement cooperation. While it is conceived as a bilateral initiative, we welcome participation and contributions by other countries and international organizations supportive of the goals of the Centre.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Another follow-up of the Bali Ministerial Meeting was the establishment of two ad hoc working groups of senior legal officials and law-enforcement practitioners in the region. The working group of senior legal officials will report back to ministers on the adequacy of regional legal frameworks for counter-terrorism cooperation and assistance. The working group will hold its first meeting on 4 and 5 August 2004 in Canberra. The ad hoc working group of law-enforcement practitioners will formulate best-practice models for fighting terrorism, develop a more effective information base and facilitate the more effective flow of intelligence on criminal activity. The ad hoc working group will have its first meeting on 12 and 13 August 2004 in Bali, Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Finally, I would like to stress the conviction of Indonesia that terrorism is the problem of every nation, and that we can best fight and vanquish the menace through multidimensional and multilateral approaches on the basis of international cooperation, collaboration and dialogue among all States. Indonesia is one such party and we stand ready, as we have in the past, to take the necessary measures and to work with other States and organizations to ensure that terrorists run out of room to hide and that terrorism is defeated.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Israel. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekel</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa01">Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of July, and to express our appreciation to your predecessor in that position. I would also like to warmly welcome the Russian chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and, in particular, Ambassador Konuzin. I welcome also Ambassador Rupérez as the Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED). I assure you, Sir, of Israel's readiness to do its utmost to assist in advancing our common counter-terrorism agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa02">Since its establishment, the CTC has faced the challenge of formulating a clear standard of international activity against terrorism. While it has not been easy, we are now beginning to see the positive fruits of those labours.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa03">For Israel, the past few years have challenged us to identify our place in the global counter-terrorism effort and to find ways in which our unfortunately extensive experience in combating terrorism can be of benefit to others. We are encouraged by the increasing number of countries seeking to ally themselves with us in this context, and we hope, too, to be able to make a visibly greater contribution to the CTC. To this end, we are looking forward to participating in the CTC's meeting with international organizations, scheduled for the fall. Another way in which Israel could contribute successfully to the CTC would be through the inclusion of Israeli experts within its efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa04">Like a disease, terrorism spreads quietly and erupts with deadly effect. Like a disease, it cannot be successfully fought with partial measures but must be combated as a whole. It must be faced with steely resolve and unblinking determination. Terrorism is a network, interconnected and often global. It must be fought as such. Terror anywhere in the world should be acknowledged for what it is and dealt with accordingly. Left to breathe, abandoned to fester or immorally discounted as someone else's problem, it only strengthens into an undertow that will inevitably re-emerge from the depths.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa05">As the international community has recognized, there is no cause or grievance that justifies terrorism. There is no such thing as good terrorism and bad terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa06">Unfortunately, Israel knows this all too well, for Israel too often finds itself on the frontline of the international war on terror. Israel knows the pain and devastation that terror wreaks because, although we wish it were not so, Israel sees it first-hand on an almost constant basis. We are keenly aware of the excruciating dilemmas democracies in particular face in confronting an enemy with no respect for life and no respect for law. Through this agonizing and ongoing experience, Israel has learned a great deal.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa07">We understand that alongside the success in international counter-terrorism that the CTC and the global community have enjoyed, it is also undeniable that we increasingly face a dangerous proliferation of terrorism. Terrorism is not just a scattered collection of individuals, domestic organizations or regional networks. It is a frantic octopus sending its deadly tentacles in all directions. This creature is becoming increasingly sophisticated in initiating joint ventures, sharing methods and moving investment capital to where it is needed to be the most lethal. It is constantly refining its practices and strategies, strengthening the logistics of mass murder.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa08">As this network adapts, so must we. We must anticipate new directions that terror will take, and we must cut them off. As terror changes, we must change with it. We cannot fight future battles based solely on past experiences; on the contrary, we must pay careful attention to emerging trends. The fact that terrorists bombed military installations did not mean that they would not attack skyscrapers. Because they attacked skyscrapers did not mean that they would not bomb subways. Because they bomb subways does not mean that they will not attempt to devastate cities with chemical weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa09">We must listen to terrorists' stated intentions. We must not underestimate their objectives or their means. We must take them at their words, and we must never discount the horrors of which they are capable. They do not play by the rules of civilized society, and to expect them to do so is to be constantly caught by terrible surprise.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa10">One example of this concept is the issue of man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS). This is a danger that Israel has experienced intimately, and it is one on which much work is still to be done. While Israel applauds the progress made by organizations such as the Group of Eight and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe regarding MANPADS, this body still needs to address the issue in an operative manner. As Israel has cautioned before, this is a terror trend that, although it has not yet caused the great number of deaths of which it is capable, unquestionably has the potential to turn our skies into vast killing fields. Anyone who ever flies on a commercial jetliner anywhere in the world has reason to fear the ease of proliferation and use of MANPADS and the tremendous danger that they hold. Israel urges this body to take the concrete steps necessary to understand and eliminate this menace.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa11">Another problem requiring immediate attention is the phenomenon of States harbouring terrorists. Terrorism, as I have said, is a truly global threat transcending the borders of States and the very idea of sovereignty. At the same time, however, it is anchored geographically and spatially, and States that harbour the culprits of international terror before, during or after their atrocious activities have themselves become an integral part of the terrorist enterprise. As many States have said before in the Council, the international community's counter-terrorism campaign is only as strong as its weakest link. If any segment of our defence is deficient, the whole will suffer. This body should demand that States that harbour terrorists desist from doing so. It should name and shame them, and it should cooperate with international initiatives to fight terrorism in all its incarnations and in every locality.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa12">A further demand to States should be an end to incitement. Incitement is not just an integral part of the terrorist infrastructure; it is its engine, and we must react to it accordingly. States that allow and even encourage their media to incite terrorism through hate-filled propaganda or that tolerate the extremist teachings of educational and spiritual leaders not only violate basic human rights obligations; they breed the next generation of terrorists, and they provide fuel to the fire of terrorism. They ensure that the years ahead will be even more dangerous than the years that have passed. The violence manifested in terror is immoral and deadly, and everything that provides its foundations is equally so. If terror is to end, incitement must end as well. We must hold those who support or tolerate it accountable, and we must work to replace it with a culture of tolerance and mutual respect.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk03-pa13">Israel believes that if all States confront terror directly and without compromise, it can be defeated. The threat of terrorism anywhere is a threat to nations everywhere. Its branches must be severed and its roots must be destroyed. This is a struggle we can and will win. Israel commends the dedication and noble desires of the CTC and looks forward to doing all it can to aid in this crucial endeavour.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Israel for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kitaoka</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">The work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) is a matter of great interest to all Member States of the United Nations, and I therefore would like to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, and to the rest of the Security Council for providing interested States other than members with the opportunity to speak today.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">I would first like to express our appreciation to Ambassador Arias, former Chairman of the CTC, for his distinguished service. I wish to congratulate Mr. Konuzin on assuming office as the new Chairman of the CTC and to thank him for his detailed presentation on the recent work of the CTC. I also would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Rupérez on taking up the post of Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, (CTED) established in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1535 (2004)</a>. There can never be any justification whatsoever for terrorism, which takes the lives of innocent people, and we expect the CTC, under its new Chairman, and the CTED, under its Executive Director, to provide the international community with the leadership it needs to respond with effective counter-terrorism measures.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">I would like to make three points.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">First, I wish to emphasize the importance of assistance for capacity-building. Providing assistance to enhance a Member State's counter-terrorism capacity not only helps to prevent acts of terrorism on its territory and to contribute to its security and development, but also contributes to maintaining the security and prosperity of the neighbouring States and of the region as a whole. For recipient States, establishing counter-terrorism measures and preventing terrorism are also important preconditions for development. We appreciate the priority that the CTC places on technical assistance. We hope that the CTC might at the same time endeavour, through its planned visits, to promote actual, appropriate technical assistance projects.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">We also believe that it is important for Member States to share information on terrorism. Through the Secure and Facilitated International Travel Initiative, announced at the Group of Eight (G-8) Summit Meeting in June this year, G-8 members will raise standards, modernize procedures and exchange information in order to deter threats, reduce costs and help to ensure the safe and efficient movement of passengers and cargo. Taking into account that such international cooperation is being undertaken, we think it would be worthwhile for the CTC also to consider setting up a forum for the CTC and other interested Member States to conduct a joint study on more effective counter-terrorism measures.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">My Government provides counter-terrorism assistance, especially to the countries of South-East Asia, and it intends to strengthen such efforts. We are placing particular priority on three areas: capacity-building of law-enforcement organizations, preventing the movement of terrorists across borders through stricter immigration control and promoting accession to counter-terrorism-related  international treaties and protocols. We also intend to continue our cooperation with counter-terrorism measures through official development assistance and other means. For example, Japan recently decided to grant approximately $6.8 million to Indonesia in order to improve security at its airports and seaports. Also, in June this year my Government hosted the Heads of Asian Coast Guard Agencies Meeting in Tokyo with a view to building cooperative relations among agencies and enabling them to share information on maritime security in the Asian region.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">Next, in relation to my first point -- the importance of capacity-building -- we need to put more effort into preventive measures. If the terrorists of today have a weakness, it is the routes they use to procure weapons and funds, which we can cut off. To do that, however, it is necessary to put in place preventive measures based on international cooperation. In that regard, it is becoming more important to raise standards with regard to the capabilities of States to combat terrorism by providing assistance for capacity-building. I wish to inform the Council that this month, together with the Malaysian Government, my Government hosted a seminar on the prevention of terrorism employing chemical weapons and managing crises in which they are used. It was the first cooperative programme of the Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism (SEARCCT) in Malaysia.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">Third, my Government has high expectations for the organizational plan, which is expected to be submitted to the CTC by the end of this month, as its implementation will strengthen the counter-terrorism function of the CTC. On the other hand, upon the establishment of the new structure, we request that the Executive Director of the CTED and the CTC create an efficient organization, one that avoids waste. We wish to reiterate that although Japan supports the revitalization of the CTC, that does not mean that expenditures for such purposes should be allowed to grow unrestrained. We also request that steps be taken to ensure transparency with regard to the sources of financing of the CTC's activities. In addition, it is important to enhance cooperation with the Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee, in accordance with the CTC's work programme for the twelfth 90-day period -- the third quarter of this year. We hope that the CTED will establish a strong working attitude that will further strengthen its cooperative relationship with related organizations such as the Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee and concerned Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">Although the CTC is going through a transitional period while it establishes the CTED, we would like to see the new organization begin full-scale operations as soon as possible. My Government wishes to cooperate in making that process a success. I would again like to express our appreciation for the dedication shown in this important period by Mr. Konuzin, Ambassador Rupérez, their outstanding staff and the Committee secretariat and experts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Côte d'Ivoire. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Djangoné-Bi</span> <span class="nation">Cote d'Ivoire</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">My delegation joins preceding speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and for the wise initiative of holding this public debate on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">We also express our great appreciation of the clear presentation of the twelfth programme of work by Ambassador Konuzin, Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning the combat against terrorism. As well, my delegation sincerely congratulates Ambassador Konuzin on his assumption of the chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and congratulates Ambassador Rupérez on his appointment as head of the Committee's Executive Directorate. We wish them every success in carrying out their new duties.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">As we take note of the conclusions and recommendations of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, I shall make a few general points of principle and of a general nature concerning the question under consideration in order to shed light on the practical problems encountered when implementing the decisions taken in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">The Council's regular, almost bimonthly holding of public meetings on this agenda item and the ever greater participation of peoples and nations in these discussions clearly testify to a universal reality: terrorist acts have taken their place among the most important, cruellest and most current threats to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">The shocks caused by the murder and the attacks against innocent civilians and those, often foreigners, who happen to be using national property, and the impact on every household around the world of the destruction of what we consider to be national patrimony but which is really, after all, the patrimony of all humankind, spare no one, no people or nation on this small planet of ours. Whether those acts take place in Bali, Jakarta, Madrid, Moscow or New Delhi, they strike the body, heart and soul of our humanity, assail our conscience, revolt us, disturb our private and collective tranquillity and undermine the peace of all nations and the security of all.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">But our analysis of this disease and the treatment to be prescribed will be right only if we know how to define and characterize this disease and, above all, if we can agree on the description of its symptoms and thoroughly lay bare its causes. The vital need to promote the primacy of multilateralism, legitimate defence and the triumph of the latter demand this. It seems to me that universal agreement on the definition of acts of terrorism is a prerequisite for any collective, concerted and coherent strategy to fight terrorism. A testament to that is the difficulties encountered by the Ad Hoc Committee tasked with drafting an international convention on terrorism and an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. In fact the Committee, almost since its creation pursuant to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a>, has been stuck at an impasse on the definition of terrorism and the scope of the future convention.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">If our peoples, nations and States fail to show the sufficient political will and active and effective solidarity to reach a happy and prompt conclusion to the negotiations under way on those two conventions essential for reducing the frequency and gravity of terrorist acts -- or even completely removing their cruel threat to international peace and security -- one hardly need consult a crystal ball to foresee the great difficulty -- even impossibility -- of the old democracies prospering. Not to advance is to recede. Worse, nascent democracies will die before reaching adolescence -- which, one knows, is not the easiest or the most gratifying time.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">Terrorists would thus have succeeded in their goal of splitting the international community and, especially, by exacerbating the negative effects of globalization, by violent insurrection by the poor against the rich -- sometimes through the unfortunate resort to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">Moreover, as a number of international situations have indicated, the lack of consensus about basic founding principles of the two future conventions will, for our poor and non-nuclear countries, continue to prolong the painful abuses of authority and the attacks on our sovereignty. When not directly responsible, some of our rich partners will be complicit in that. I am referring to State terrorism of the kind imposed upon us by virtue of the liberties that some powerful and so-called democratic States have taken with multilateral provisions painstakingly arrived at, including the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Ottawa Convention on landmines and the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, among others.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">We hail the positive strengthening of cooperation between the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban and the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism, and we encourage them to continue on that noble course. At the same time, my delegation appeals to all our peoples, nations and States -- with the unambiguous and irrepressible sense of solidarity that they share -- to quickly overcome the remaining obstacles to the adoption of those two conventions, which remain sadly absent from the list of international legal instruments relating to the prevention and suppression of international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">Lastly, as other speakers have done, I would like to emphasize that the fight against terrorism cannot make progress without rigorous respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. We are devoted to those principles and we would like to assure Ambassadors Konuzin and Rupérez of our full willingness to cooperate with the CTC and its Executive Directorate.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">That is the modest contribution that my delegation wanted to make to what has been said by all of today's speakers on the pressing subject of threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Côte d'Ivoire for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vohidov</span> <span class="nation">Uzbekistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Allow me, first of all, to express my appreciation to Mr. Konuzin, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and acting Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, for his accomplished report on the activities of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">We truly welcome the rapid development of practical mechanisms of international cooperation to combat terrorism. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1535 (2004)</a> has given further important impetus to that effort. In that connection, we welcome the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban. We fully support the efforts of those Committees to reinforce the capabilities of United Nations Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">In recent years, the Central Asian region, like other parts of the world, has experienced the brutal manifestations of criminal terrorist schemes. The strengthening of the forces of international terrorism, extremism and separatism casts a shadow over the stability of the countries of the region. It is necessary to note that, after a period of decline, international terrorism has now started to galvanize its capacities and to employ much more destructive means. The disturbing reality is that more and more countries and regions are becoming targets for terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">In view of that fact, I would like to stress several important factors in countering the threat of terrorism. First, counter-terrorism is not only a fight against terrorist acts and their perpetrators. It is first necessary to combat the numerous radical and extremist centres that create and disseminate the ideology of hatred. Those centres are designed to poison people's minds and to recruit new zombies to fill the terrorists' ranks, primarily among young people.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">In that connection, I would like to draw the Council's attention to a very serious threat, not only to the stability of Central Asia but to that of the entire world, that is emanating from the religious-extremist organization Hizb ut-Tahrir. In dealing with organizations of this kind it is essential to take into account the fact that peaceful extremist movements do not exist at all. By their very nature, they are filled with a sense of hatred and intolerance that eventually turns into violence. In that regard, our call is for the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee to give more serious attention to the danger of religious-extremist organizations, including Hizb ut-Tahrir, and to undertake determined measures by applying strict sanctions against them.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">Secondly, it is no secret that international terrorist organizations are trying to gain access to components of weapons of mass destruction. In the last three years alone, Uzbekistan's law-enforcement bodies have confiscated 15 containers of radioactive materials as they made their way across our country. We consider resolving the issue of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to be a vital element of our foreign policy and an essential part of regional and global security. In that context, realizing the initiative to create a nuclear-free-zone in Central Asia is in the interest not only of the region but of the entire world community.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, the illicit flow of narcotics has become one of the main sources of financing for terrorist structures. To ensure safe corridors and good markets for their commodities, narco-syndicates are entering into alliances with destructive forces whose terrorist acts create favourable conditions for the narcotics business, as they destabilize situations in different parts of the world. Having realized that danger, Uzbekistan has taken the initiative to establish a regional information and coordination centre in Central Asia to combat trans-border crime connected with the illegal flow of narcotics. That initiative was supported by the Secretary-General, and we hope that many members of the Council will offer their kind assistance in realizing this plan.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">My fourth point is that positive results in the fight against international terrorism can be attained only through a solid global system of counteraction with the United Nations at its centre. The principle of indivisibility demands a more active and increased role by regional organizations in the process. In that connection, we attach great importance to the recently established regional counter-terrorism structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which is based in Tashkent, which will coordinate the interaction of SCO member States with a view to combating terrorism, separatism and extremism.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">In our view, establishing contact mechanisms between the regional counter-terrorism structure of the SCO, the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> would play a considerable role towards consolidating international efforts to combat new challenges. We are of the belief that taking into account the points I have outlined would contribute to the effective realization of the international counter-terrorism strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">We would like to note that, over many years, Uzbekistan has continuously appealed to the international community to consolidate common efforts in the fight against terrorism. The work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee reflects our vision for tackling this problem. The Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council has made significant progress in its work and is no doubt an effective mechanism for coordinating the international efforts against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">The Government of Uzbekistan welcomes the programme of work of the Committee for the coming 90-day period. The recommendations and provisions reflected in the programme will no doubt contribute to further strengthening the cooperation between the Committee and member countries to combat terrorism. In particular, I would like to stress the importance of the development of the work of assessing countries' needs for technical assistance. The Counter-Terrorism Committee's experts will play an important role to that effect by visiting those countries.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Kazakhstan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kazykhanov</span> <span class="nation">Kazakhstan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">I am honoured to address the Security Council today on behalf of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in order to lay out the common position of the States members of that international regional organization: the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Kazakhstan.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">I wish at the outset to echo the words of high commendation and gratitude addressed to the former Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), Ambassador Arias, and to his successor in that post, the acting Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, Mr. Alexander Konuzin, for the dynamic and multifaceted work being done by the CTC at this crucial stage of its reform.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">International terrorism remains a primary and constant threat to security and stability throughout the world. Countering it requires the consolidation and coordination of global efforts. The countries of the CSTO intend to make an important contribution to strengthening the anti-terrorist coalition and to regional and international security on the basis of the generally recognized norms and principles of international law, with the lead coordinating role being played by the United Nations. In that connection, the CSTO supports the strengthening and revitalization of the CTC's work, pursuant to the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1535(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1535 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">In our unanimous view, the report introduced today by the Chairman of the CTC on the Committee's work over the past three months and its programme of work for the coming 90-day period confirm the fact that the process of reforming the CTC is gaining ground and moving in the right direction. The main task in that context remains the effective monitoring of the implementation by member States of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is crucial in that respect that the Committee seek more actively to develop new approaches to coordinating technical assistance to States while closely linking it to the strengthening of interaction with international and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">We express our support for the work already under way to prepare countries' technical needs assessments and to organize CTC field missions to interested countries, with their consent. Such work should enhance direct dialogue and cooperation between the CTC and States with the aim of ensuring fuller and more effective implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and that the provision of technical assistance will be as targeted as possible and accurately reflect the requests and needs of States. We are convinced that the participation of the appropriate international organizations in such missions will help the task at hand to succeed. For its part, the CSTO is prepared to consider the possibility of participating in that work in the context of developing interaction and cooperation with the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">In the context of combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the States members of the CSTO support the measures set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a>. Members of the CSTO are at the forefront of the struggle against international terrorism and are particularly sensitive to the magnitude of that threat. Our desire to pool efforts so as effectively to counter new threats and challenges -- in particular those posed by terrorism, extremism, the traffic in illegal drugs and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction -- is becoming an increasingly significant factor in deepening the integration processes within the organization.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">Recently, much has been done on a practical level to increase the operation of the political instruments available to our organization. Its member States have already taken steps to implement planned measures to combat the external drug threat. Recommendations have been drafted to unify counter-terrorism legislation. Work has been finalized to establish a joint rapid-deployment force that will help to meet the common security challenges faced by our CSTO partners. The policy of reviving efforts to resolve new challenges in the area of international security through close interaction with the United Nations and other international and regional organizations -- including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- was further reaffirmed in the political statement issued by the States members of the CSTO adopted at their meeting of 18 June in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">We believe that such interaction should be mutually complementary. One important practical outcome of that meeting was the adoption of guidelines regarding priority areas for the organization's activities in 2004 and 2005, including measures to increase cooperation in countering international terrorism, militant extremism and the illegal distribution of drugs, taking national interests into account.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">We hope that, in the light of such challenges, the CTC will in the near future propose effective mechanisms for the exchange of information, for disseminating the most recent experiences and for organizing technical assistance in the context of coordinating the practical counter-terrorism efforts of international organizations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to Mr. Alexander Konuzin to respond to questions posed and comments made.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Konuzin</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I should like at the outset sincerely to thank all of those who spoke today in support of the report of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and also for the kind words they addressed to me. I am grateful for the ideas, comments and assessments expressed in this Chamber. I thank them also for the criticism, which is very useful to us, so that the work of the CTC does not become routine.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">As has been noted today, the destruction caused by terrorist activities is constantly increasing. Today, in the city of Voronezh, in Central Russia, a terrorist act was committed, killing one woman and wounding several other people. There can be no idea of routine in the combat against terrorism. Russia, as Chairman of the Committee, will not allow that to happen.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">All statements made today will be taken into consideration in the CTC. All of the points that were made will be taken into account in our work.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">I should now like to touch briefly on some of the points made today.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">We fully agree with the points made regarding the need to revitalize the work of the CTC, primarily through reform. That will be our top priority. However, I should like to assure members of the Security Council that in carrying out such reform, the CTC will not halt its ongoing activities and will continue to use the instruments it has at its disposal in discharging the tasks entrusted to it by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">I would take note here of a point that was made by many speakers -- that is, concern about the fact that many States have not yet become parties to Conventions relating to counter-terrorism. I would note in that connection the view that was expressed that perhaps many States require technical assistance in order to become parties to those Conventions, and we will take that point into account in the work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">A useful view was expressed here that reports should be received not just from individual States but from regional organizations as well. I am delighted by the fact that many of those who spoke today supported the idea of dispatching CTC missions to one country with the consent of that country. We are now working on this question in a specific manner, and we hope that in time such a trip can be made.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">One last point: many statements stressed the importance of assessing the technical needs of States in order to help them comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and then to find an opportunity to provide them with assistance commensurate with their needs. That is an important area of the activities of the CTC, and, in that connection, I would appeal to all States Members of the United Nations not to wait to appeal to the CTC if they have a specific request or certain preferences in areas where they are experiencing a need for technical assistance. They should come to the CTC. Donor countries come to us and ask us what kind of assistance is needed by States, and they are prepared to make such assistance available.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">The CTC is prepared to serve as a middleman in establishing cooperation between donors and those who need assistance.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
