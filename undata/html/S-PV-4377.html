	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council remains concerned at the continuing conflict in Angola. It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the União Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA) headed by Mr. J. Savimbi, which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the 'Accordos de Paz' (<a href="../pdf/S-22609.pdf" class="pdf">S/22609</a>, annex), the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council, which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Council considers the four-point agenda for peace proposed by the Government of Angola a useful indication of areas where an agreement or progress should be reached. It calls on the UNITA armed faction headed by Mr. J. Savimbi to cease all military action and to enter into a dialogue with the Government of Angola on how to conclude the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol on this basis.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks by UNITA forces on the civilian population of Angola. It stresses that such attacks are unacceptable and cannot be justified by any political goals. The Council reminds their perpetrators that such acts are in violation of international law and may have further implications.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms that the failure by the armed faction of UNITA to implement its obligations under the 'Accordos de Paz', the Lusaka Protocol and its relevant resolutions remains the reason for the Security Council sanctions against UNITA. The Council is determined to keep sanctions in place until it is convinced that the conditions in its relevant resolutions are met. It reiterates its call on all States to implement strictly the sanctions regime against UNITA and urges them to strengthen, where appropriate, their internal legislation related to application of sanction measures imposed by the Council. The Council reaffirms its intention to keep sanctions under close monitoring and periodic review in order to raise their effectiveness, including as they relate to UNITA activity abroad.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction that, at their recent summit, the Heads of States and Governments of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries undertook to prepare a report on how SADC countries implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1295(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1295 (2000)</a>. The Council encourages SADC countries to cooperate fully in their efforts to implement the Security Council's measures against UNITA.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council encourages the Government of Angola to promote the peace process and in this regard welcomes the initiatives by the Government of Angola, as well as by the Angolan people, including the civil society and the churches. It calls on the Angolan authorities to continue efforts aimed at national reconciliation and stabilization of the situation in the country in consultation with all segments of the Angolan society, including the civil society and the churches. These should focus on re-establishment of the State administration, improvement of the social and economic situation of the population, promotion of the rule of law, protection of human rights, the activity of the Interagency Committee and of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council supports the intention of the Government of Angola to hold elections as a part of the ongoing democratization process in Angola in conformity with the universally accepted democratic principles and standards. It stresses the need to create the necessary conditions for elections to be free and fair. The Council requests the Secretary-General to provide appropriate support, in coordination with the Government of Angola, in preparation of elections, including through the work of the ongoing United Nations technical assistance mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council notes the positive contribution that the United Nations Office in Angola (UNOA) is making towards finding the solution to the Angolan conflict. It reiterates its full support for the work of UNOA and the Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council is seriously concerned with the plight of the Angolan population, particularly the internally displaced persons, and, in order to alleviate its suffering, calls again on all parties concerned to facilitate the delivery of emergency relief assistance. The work of the United Nations agencies and other international organizations delivering assistance to those in the affected areas is of the utmost importance and must continue unobstructed with the financial support of the international community."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-24.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/24</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">I once again thank the Minister of Interior and the Deputy Ministers accompanying him for having come to New York to honour us with their presence at this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
