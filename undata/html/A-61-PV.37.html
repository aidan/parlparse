	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">The General Assembly will continue with the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">As members will recall, when the 36th plenary meeting was adjourned earlier today, there still remained one seat from among the Latin American and Caribbean States to be filled.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the next round of balloting by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">This thirtieth round of balloting, in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, will also be the fourteenth unrestricted ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">For this thirtieth round of balloting, may I remind the Assembly that any Member State from among the Latin American and Caribbean States may be a candidate except those outgoing members and those already members of the Security Council, namely Argentina and Peru.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">We shall now begin the voting process.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">Members are requested to remain seated until all ballots have been collected.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">Ballot papers marked "B" will now be distributed. May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers marked "B" for the Latin American and Caribbean States the name of one State for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers marked "B" will be declared invalid if they contain the name of more than one State.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa09">If a ballot paper contains the name of a Member State which does not belong to that region, that ballot will be declared invalid.</p>
