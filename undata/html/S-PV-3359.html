	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">&quot;The Security Council is deeply concerned at the continuing violence in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly the attacks on the 'safe area' of Gorazde, and the recent acts of violence and terror, including reported acts of ethnic cleansing in Banja Luka and Prijedor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">&quot;The Council takes note of the letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, of 2 April 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-378.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/378</a>), in which he reported, <i>inter alia</i>, on the hostilities in the Eastern parts of his country. The Council, taking note also of the assessment of the situation provided by the Secretariat and in the Secretary-General's reports (paragraphs 16 and 17 of <a href="../pdf/S-1994-291.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/291</a> of 11 March 1994 and paragraphs 29 and 30 of <a href="../pdf/S-1994-300.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/300</a> of 16 March 1994), calls for an end to any provocative actions by whomsoever committed in and around the 'safe areas'.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">&quot;The Council strongly condemns the shelling and infantry and artillery attacks by the besieging Bosnian Serb forces against the 'safe area' of Gorazde in which many civilians have lost their lives and several hundreds have been wounded. The Council takes serious note of the continuing defiance of the relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-824(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 824 (1993)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-836(1993).pdf" class="pdf">836 (1993)</a> related to the protection of 'safe areas'. The Council demands the immediate cessation of any further attacks against the 'safe area' of Gorazde and its population and calls upon those concerned to take all measures to ensure full respect for the status of the 'safe areas' in accordance with the relevant provisions of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-824(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 824 (1993)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">&quot;The Council welcomes the measures being taken by UNPROFOR to strengthen its presence in Gorazde, and the impending visit of the UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia and Herzegovina to further assess the situation. The Council calls upon the parties to ensure that UNPROFOR troops have unimpeded access to the area in and around Gorazde and to assure those troops' safety and security. The Council underlines the importance it attaches to ensuring the safety and security of UNPROFOR troops in and around Gorazde.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">&quot;The Council stresses the need to achieve normal conditions of life in Gorazde, including restoration of essential public services, with the assistance of the United Nations, and with the cooperation of the parties.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">&quot;The Council deplores recent acts of violence and terror including ethnic cleansing particularly in Prijedor and Banja Luka. It reaffirms that the International Tribunal was established under its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-827(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 827 (1993)</a> for the purpose of investigating crimes of this sort, and trying persons accused of committing such crimes. The Council stresses the importance it attaches to full compliance with international humanitarian law in all its aspects throughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa12">&quot;The Council calls upon all parties to join the negotiation process aimed at the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and further calls for an immediate cease-fire, the cessation of hostilities and an exchange of all persons imprisoned as a result of the war. The Council welcomes the planned meeting between the military commanders in Sarajevo under the auspices of UNPROFOR.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa13">&quot;The Council affirms its determination to remain seized of the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-14.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/14</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
