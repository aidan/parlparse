	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have the following documents before them: <a href="../pdf/S-1995-722.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/722</a>, letter dated 17 August 1995 from the Prime Minister of the Republic of Zaire addressed to the Secretary-General; and <a href="../pdf/S-1995-723.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/723</a>, letter dated 18 August 1995 from the Secretary-General addressed to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Zaire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council views with deep concern the forcible repatriation of Rwandan and Burundian refugees by the Government of Zaire and the increasingly tense situation in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council takes note of the recent letter from the Government of Zaire to the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-722.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/722</a>) and the Secretary-General's reply (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-723.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/723</a>) in which he urges the Government of Zaire to continue to provide assistance to Rwandan and Burundian refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council considers that Zaire and the other States which have accepted refugees from Rwanda and Burundi make an important contribution, in spite of the considerable difficulties created for them thereby, to peace and stability in the region. Their contribution is of special importance in view of the genocide which took place in Rwanda and the possibility of further bloodshed in Burundi. The Council also notes the commitment of the Government of Rwanda to take the necessary steps to facilitate the safe return of its nationals as soon as possible and encourages it to continue its efforts in order to implement its undertakings in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council calls on the Government of Zaire to stand by its humanitarian obligations regarding refugees, including, <i>inter alia</i>, those under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951, and to reconsider and halt its declared policy of the forcible repatriation of refugees to Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council supports the decision by the Secretary-General to send the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the region to engage in urgent discussions with the Government of Zaire and neighbouring States with a view to resolving the situation. It encourages all Governments in the region to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to achieve the voluntary and orderly repatriation of refugees. It also calls on the international community to provide all possible assistance to help care for the refugees."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-41.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/41</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
