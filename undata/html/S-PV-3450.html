	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1235.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1235</a>, letter dated 1 November 1994 from the Permanent Representatives of Portugal, the Russian Federation and the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council; and <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1241.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1241</a>, letter dated 3 November 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council, while welcoming the initialling of the peace protocol in Lusaka on 31 October 1994, is gravely concerned over recent reports of an intensification of military operations, in particular those towards Huambo, which put the lives of Angolan citizens at risk and jeopardize the successful completion of the peace process. It reiterates its demand to the parties to cease immediately military hostilities throughout Angola and to establish quickly an effective and firm cease-fire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council notes that the leaderships of both parties must have adequate opportunity to meet with their negotiating teams to prepare for the military talks scheduled to begin on 10 November. It urges the Government of Angola to allow flight clearances into Huambo to enable the UNITA negotiating team to consult with their leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Security Council stresses once again that any obstruction to the peace process will be unacceptable. It urges the Government of Angola to exercise its authority to bring an immediate end to the military activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;At this particular juncture, the Security Council stresses the need for both parties to spare no effort to bring about a stable and long-lasting peace in Angola. It calls upon them to honour their commitments made at the Lusaka talks, to exercise maximum restraint and responsibility, and to refrain from any action that could jeopardize the signing of the protocol on 15 November 1994.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-63.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/63</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
