<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Onanga-Anyanga</span> <span class="nation">Gabon</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">It is partly thanks to the far-sightedness of the President of the General Assembly that we are meeting here today to take up the reports of the First Committee. All those who, like myself, had the privilege of participating in the various meetings of the expanded Bureau of the General Assembly, over which he presided, have been able to see his keen interest in all the items on the General Assembly's agenda. We have also seen how much he values respect for the timetable for the work of each Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">It was in this particularly encouraging atmosphere that Ambassador Sychou of Belarus, Chairman of the First Committee, so successfully guided the work of that important body. I now have the honour and the pleasure of introducing to the General Assembly the reports of the First Committee under agenda items 60 to 81 of the General Assembly, which were assigned to the First Committee. These reports are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-51-566.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/566</a>, <a href="../pdf/A-51-566.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/566</a>/Adds.1 to 21 and <a href="../pdf/A-51-567.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/567</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">Before introducing the reports, I would like to say a few words on their format.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">As the Bureau of the Committee has already indicated to the President, a special effort has been made at this session to try to offer a more rational presentation of the reports of the First Committee. In a note dated 20 November 1996, I informed the members of Committee that the changes that had been introduced were designed to avoid the repetition of the first four introductory paragraphs.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">I also underlined that the general effect of this measure would be to make the reports easier to use and would greatly reduce the number of pages, which is particularly important during this period of grave financial crisis in our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">I appreciate the favourable reception given by delegations to the innovations I proposed to them, and I am particularly grateful to those delegations that submitted their comments to me.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">The reports of the First Committee for the current session are therefore more standardized. Each report has a sort of preface, covering all the agenda items assigned to the First Committee -- namely, items 60 to 81. There is then a brief four-paragraph introduction to each report that serves as a chapeau, it being understood that each item is the subject of an individual report attached to the main report as an addendum. In addition to mentioning when the General Assembly decided on the items to be included in the agenda of the First Committee, the introduction also contains the programme of work, the list of documents considered in the course of the Committee's work and the documents containing the final decisions of the Committee on each item.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">The work of the Committee during the fifty-first session of the General Assembly reflects the new atmosphere of overall harmonization in the international arena, the impact of which has been particularly helpful for negotiations in the areas of disarmament and the promotion of international security.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa09">The Committee considered 48 draft resolutions, two draft decisions and a number of amendments to the draft resolutions during the current session. By the end of its work the Committee had adopted 46 draft resolutions, 22 of them by consensus; thus, 45 per cent of the draft resolutions were adopted by consensus. If we add to this all the draft resolutions that were adopted by a large majority, with at least 100 votes in favour, we can say that a total of 40 draft resolutions -- 89 per cent -- enjoyed broad support in the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa10">The two draft decisions submitted to the Committee were also adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">Following consultations, the authors of two draft resolutions felt that it was not advisable to submit them to the Committee for a decision.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa12">Although the figures do not express all the nuances and controversy inherent in disarmament negotiations, they clearly reflect a consensus on the need to strengthen the process of general and complete disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa13">There are of course still major obstacles as to the ways and means of attaining this ultimate goal. Even in the absence of sharp ideological differences, such as those that prevailed during the cold-war era, national security aspirations could slow future progress in the area of disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa14">If this were to come about, it would no doubt nullify the commendable efforts already made, which led to very encouraging results this year, the most outstanding of which are the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa through the adoption of the Pelindaba Treaty at Cairo, the recent signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the depositing of the instruments of ratification of the sixty-fifth State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which will enter into force in April 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa15">The general debate was held from 14 to 24 October on all the agenda items of the First Committee on disarmament and international security. Ninety-four delegations participated in the general debate. In their statements, delegations welcomed the progress made and stressed the actions and initiatives that should be taken to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and to speed up the disarmament process in all its aspects. In that connection, we should note that items on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are still the focus of concern of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa16">Issues relating to a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban, nuclear-weapon-free zones, a halt to the production of fissile material for military purposes, nuclear non-proliferation, weapons of mass destruction and their manufacture and conventional weapons are still by far the most important. Twenty-five of the 48 draft resolutions taken up in the Committee dealt with these items.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa17">The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was undoubtedly the most outstanding achievement of the session. Despite its inadequacies, delegations were in general of the view that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was a significant achievement in the area of nuclear non-proliferation. Signed by 135 States in record time, the Treaty embodies the aspirations of the international community to never again see a single nuclear explosion, even for experimental purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa18">It was also recognized that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons not only reflect the commitment of the international community to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons but are also important pillars for strengthening non-proliferation regimes as a whole. Many delegations, however, regretted the fact that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty continues to allow for qualitative improvements in nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa19">Many delegations emphasized the urgent need to take advantage of the great opportunity available in the current international atmosphere and move ahead in the area of nuclear disarmament, in particular. However, it should be noted that there is currently no consensus on the approach to be taken to attain that objective. Should the focus continue to be only on bilateral negotiations, or should we concentrate on multilateral negotiations in accordance with a clearly established timetable for the total elimination of nuclear weapons with strict international verification? Those two questions show us where we are in the debate and will determine the action to be taken in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa20">It is to be hoped that negotiations on complete nuclear disarmament will continue in 1997 in the Conference on Disarmament. Delegations also expressed a keen desire for continuing negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the conclusion of a treaty prohibiting the production of fissile materials for military purposes. It is generally recognized that such an instrument would strengthen the nuclear-non-proliferation regime.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa21">The establishment of new nuclear-weapon-free zones and the strengthening of those already existing were the focus of particular attention by the Committee. Draft resolutions on denuclearization of the southern hemisphere and adjacent regions, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, the strengthening of the regime established under the Treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean and a treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East region were all widely supported by delegations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa22">Confirming the urgent need for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legality or illegality of the threat of use of nuclear weapons was seen by a majority of delegations as a major event. The draft resolution on this item was widely supported, which confirms the importance of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa23">We must now hope that the Court's decision will have a positive impact on future negotiations on nuclear disarmament, such as in the Review Conference of the States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000. The first session of the Preparatory Committee for that Conference is scheduled for 7 to 18 April 1997 at New York, as decided by the Committee. Several delegations expressed the hope that that Conference would provide a framework for the in-depth study of many issues, such as the still pending legal granting of negative security guarantees by nuclear States to non-nuclear States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa24">Another important event on the international community's disarmament agenda will be the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. It is particularly encouraging to see that the adoption of the draft resolution in the Committee on this matter was almost unanimous. If all delegations continue to show the same goodwill, we can hope for a consensus decision on this important item at the upcoming meetings of the Disarmament Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa25">The particular feature of the items on the agenda of the First Committee is that, in one way or another, they affect the lives of thousands of people. That is true in the case of questions relating to nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction, and also, particularly in recent times, of questions relating to conventional weapons. In this sensitive area, transparency in international transfers of conventional weapons is essential. The Committee reaffirmed this principle and emphasized the importance of the good conduct and improvement of the Register of Conventional Arms. Several delegations reiterated the need to expand the Register so that it would better respond to reality.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa26">It is especially gratifying to note that seven of the nine draft resolutions on weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons were adopted by consensus. The spirit of dialogue and cooperation demonstrated by delegations enabled the Committee to adopt without a vote one draft resolution, rather than two, on the state of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa27">Another item before the Committee is the issue of anti-personnel mines, which several delegations have unhesitatingly described as weapons of mass destruction. In welcoming the adoption on 3 May 1996 of the revised Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and other Devices, or Protocol II, which prohibits all undetectable mines that do not self-destruct, a majority of delegations regretted that the Protocol had not gone further and consequently came out in favour of the complete elimination of anti-personnel mines, calling urgently for the conclusion of a treaty on a total ban on these weapons. Of all the draft resolutions before the Committee, this one had the largest number of sponsors and was adopted in the Committee by a large majority.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa28">Pending conclusion of an international agreement banning the use, stockpiling, manufacture and transfer of anti-personnel mines, the Committee encouraged all States to continue to observe their unilateral moratoriums on these weapons and called on all other States concerned to take similar measures.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa29">The Committee deeply appreciated the efforts of the Secretary-General in the area of mine clearance and called for a strengthening of the action of the international community in this area and of the assistance to victims of the blind and intolerable violence of anti-personnel mines. Because of the devastating impact of these horrible weapons, several delegations called for priority to be given to the humanitarian aspects in dealing with this sensitive question.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa30">The proliferation of anti-personnel mines and all other conventional weapons, particularly small arms, poses a great threat to international peace and security. The adoption at the last substantive meeting of the Disarmament Commission of the "Guidelines for international arms transfers in the context of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-36.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 46/36</a> H of 6 December 1991" was welcomed by the Committee because of its potential for combating illicit trafficking in conventional arms.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa31">Here it is encouraging to see that the Committee adopted three draft resolutions by consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation of conventional weapons: measures to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms; assistance to States for curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and collecting them; and consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures. All of these draft resolutions have a direct impact on disarmament at the regional level, on which the Committee rightly focused, <i>inter alia</i>, by adopting draft resolutions on regional disarmament and on conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa32">The adoption without a vote of all the draft resolutions on the United Nations Regional Centres for Peace and Disarmament in Latin America and the Caribbean, in Asia and the Pacific and in Africa confirms the Committee's interest in regional disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa33">This year once again, the Committee also adopted by consensus a draft resolution on regional confidence-building measures to show its support for efforts of the States members of the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa in order to promote peace and to consolidate security at the subregional level.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa34">Directly related to the threat to peace and international security posed by the violent disintegration of States, the Committee adopted a draft resolution whereby the General Assembly would call upon Member States to take measures to prevent the occurrence of that phenomenon.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa35">As members know, the Committee considered all the items submitted to it and took decisions on every one. The details of these decisions are contained in the various reports now before the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa36">This applies also to agenda item 62, entitled "Question of Antarctica". Once again, the Committee adopted by consensus the one draft resolution on this item, thereby complying with our good tradition of several years' standing, of adopting important resolutions without a vote. Statements made at our debates reflected the unanimous belief that, in the interests of the human race, Antarctica must remain a zone of peace, where the environment is protected and scientific research can be carried out freely. The draft resolution takes note of the report of the Secretary-General and the role of the United Nations Environment Programme through, <i>inter alia</i>, the participation of its Executive Director in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa37">I would now like to comment briefly on the report of the First Committee and to mention a few technical corrections which should be made. I refer to <a href="../pdf/A-51-566-Add.13.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/566/Add.13</a> on item 73. In paragraph 2, the second line should read in part: "Conference on Disarmament", not "Committee on Disarmament". I invite delegations to take note of this correction.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa38">Before concluding, I would like to pay tribute to all delegations that participated in the work of the Committee. They demonstrated a praiseworthy spirit of cooperation in our common search for ways and means of building a safer and more stable world.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa39">In particular, I would like to thank the Chairman of our Committee, His Excellency Mr. Alyaksandr Sychou, for his wise advice to me. He presided over the work of the Committee very ably, thanks to his thorough knowledge of issues relating to disarmament and international security and to his skills as an experienced diplomat. I should also like to thank the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee, Ambassador García of Colombia and Ambassador Mernier of Belgium, who discharged their functions most efficiently.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa40">My thanks also go to the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Marrack Goulding, for his valuable input to the Committee's work and to thank the Director of the Centre for Disarmament Affairs, Mr. Prvoslav Davinic, who so brilliantly directs the Secretariat staff serving our Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa41">In particular, I would like to thank the Secretary of the First Committee, Mr. Lin Kuo-chung, whose extensive experience and great competence were a major factor in the success of the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa42">Lastly, I would like to thank Mr. Mohammed Sattar, Mr. Timur Alasaniya and the other staff members of the Centre for Disarmament Affairs for the invaluable assistance which they provided to our Committee at this session.</p>

Subsequently we have had several discussions with many of the principal sponsors of the draft resolution. They have assured us that our substantive concerns can be addressed through appropriate interpretation of the draft resolution. As our concerns have been considerably, but not completely, alleviated by these assurances and associated discussions, we have decided to move to an abstention on this draft resolution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kim Chang Guk</span> <span class="nation">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea abstained in the voting on the resolution entitled "Nuclear disarmament with a view to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons" (51/45 G), which was originally put forward by Japan, for the same reason that it did so last year.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">As many delegations clearly said in the First Committee, the title and the contents of the resolution are not in accord. The resolution does not clarify anything as to how ultimately to eliminate nuclear weapons. The discrepancy represents Japan's double-dealing tactics on nuclear-weapon issues.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">Japan is trying very hard to give the world the impression that it is opposed to nuclear weapons by talking a lot about its horrendous experience of nuclear attack. However, the contrary is the case. Japan is the only country that is accumulating large quantities of plutonium, in disregard of the denunciation of the world's peace-loving peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">Japan has made no settlement for the war crimes it committed in the past. Without a doubt, Japan now has the ulterior objective in the resolution of covering up its real intention of nuclear armament. We are afraid that the resolution may mislead the world public.</p>

	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa01">The allegation made by the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was nothing but a malicious exercise in anti-Japanese propaganda. While I do not wish to argue against specific allegations made in his statement, I should like to make the following statement.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa02">Japan has made it clear that it is determined to conduct a proactive foreign policy that will enable it to contribute to the future well-being of mankind. Japan pursues this policy in a spirit of international cooperation and in keeping with its Constitution, which prohibits the use of force as a means of resolving international conflicts. Remorseful of the suffering brought about by the Second World War on its neighbouring countries, Japan has expressed on many occasions its determination to see that such a tragedy is never repeated.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa03">Japan is committed to forging relations based on mutual trust and confidence with the countries of Asia, the Pacific and the rest of the world. Furthermore, Japan strictly upholds its three non-nuclear principles of not possessing, producing or introducing into its territory nuclear weapons. That Japan would develop and possess nuclear weapons is inconceivable.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa04">In introducing the draft resolution on nuclear disarmament with a view to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons, Japan was sincerely motivated. Japan was very glad to see the resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority. My delegation calls upon the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in a more positive manner in the deliberations of the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">My statement made in explanation of position was based on the facts. Japan has not settled the issue of crimes committed during the Second World War. Japan is now accumulating plutonium; it is buying plutonium from world producers. The Japanese Diet is discussing the fact that it is not going to apologize for war crimes. That means that Japan will again commit crimes against humanity. That is our concern.</p>
