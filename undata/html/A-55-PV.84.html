The relevant report of the Sixth Committee has been issued under the symbol <a href="../pdf/A-55-607.pdf">A/55/607</a>. The Sixth Committee recommends the draft resolution found in paragraph 11 of its report to the General Assembly for adoption.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa12">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, inter alia, decide to establish an ad hoc Committee on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, open also to participation by States members of the specialized agencies; and to further the work done, consolidate areas of agreement and resolve outstanding issues with a view to elaborating a generally acceptable instrument based on the draft articles on jurisdictional immunities of States and their property adopted by the International Law Commission at its forty-third session, and also based on the discussions of the open-ended working group of the Sixth Committee established under resolutions 53/98 and 54/101 and their results.

The Assembly would also reiterate its invitation to Governments to respond to the questionnaire on unilateral acts of States circulated by the Secretariat, and to submit the most relevant national legislation, decisions of domestic courts and State practice relevant to diplomatic protection. The General Assembly would furthermore decide that the next session of the Commission shall be held at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 23 April to 1 June and from 2 July to 10 August 2001. It would recommend that the International Law Commission continue its work on the topics in its current programme.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa19">Noting with appreciation the work done by the Commission on the topic "International liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law", the Assembly would also request the Commission to resume consideration of the liability aspects of that topic as soon as the second reading of the draft articles on the prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities is completed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa20">The draft resolution was adopted without a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly will adopt this draft resolution without a vote as well.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa22">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, inter alia, express its appreciation to the International Law Commission for its valuable work on this topic. It would also take note of the articles on nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States, presented by the International Law Commission in the form of a declaration, the text of which is annexed to the draft resolution. It would further invite Governments to take into account, as appropriate, the provisions contained therein in dealing with issues of nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States and recommend that all efforts be made for the wide dissemination of the text of those articles.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa23">It is hoped that the General Assembly will, like the Sixth Committee, adopt the draft resolution without a vote.</div>

It would also request the host country to continue to take steps to resolve the problem relating to the parking of diplomatic vehicles.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa26">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly will be in a position to act likewise.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa27">I now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee under agenda item 162, "Establishment of the International Criminal Court".

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa29">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and it is hoped that the Assembly will be in a position to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa30">I now invite the Assembly's attention to agenda item 163, "Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization".

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa34">Furthermore, it would welcome the report of the Secretary-General containing a summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures, and would request the Secretary-General to present to the Assembly any further views that he may have, as appropriate, on the deliberations and main findings, including the recommendations, of the ad hoc expert group.</div>

The Ad Hoc Committee would also keep on its agenda the question of convening a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to formulate a joint organized response of the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The Assembly would further decide that the Ad Hoc Committee would meet from 12 to 23 February 2001 and that the work would also continue during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, between 15 and 26 October 2001, within the framework of a working group of the Sixth Committee.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa55">Before concluding, in order to submit indeed a comprehensive report, I should like to mention that a very popular draft resolution was submitted by Australia and several other co-sponsors. Under the terms of that draft, the members of the Sixth Committee and the Secretariat participated in the social gathering after the completion of the work of the Committee on 22 November. Since that draft resolution was implemented in the nearby Mica Bar within the 24 hours since its introduction, there was no need to incorporate the draft into a formal report. I would like to express my wish in this regard that all draft resolutions would be implemented in such a speedy manner, though not necessarily in the terms of the same substance.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa02">All the Arab States condemn terrorism in all its aspects and forms, whether committed by individuals, groups or States. All the Arab delegations, therefore, cooperated in a positive and serious manner with the coordinator of the resolution that has been adopted and with other delegations, demonstrating great flexibility in reaching a balanced resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The Arab delegations reaffirm their understanding of the second preambular paragraph of the resolution, which refers to all relevant General Assembly resolutions on measures to eliminate international terrorism, including <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-46-51.pdf">resolution 46/51</a> of 1991, paragraph 15 of which states that the General Assembly</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa04">"Considers that nothing in the present resolution could in any way prejudice the right to self-determination, freedom and independence, as derived from the Charter of the United Nations, of peoples forcibly deprived of that right referred to in the Declaration of Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, particularly peoples under colonial and racist regimes or other forms of alien domination, or the right of these peoples to struggle legitimately to this end and to seek and receive support in accordance with the principles of the Charter, the above-mentioned Declaration and the relevant General Assembly resolutions".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa05">In this context, the Arab delegations would like to reiterate that what has been taking place in the occupied Arab territories, especially in recent weeks -- the missile attacks, bombings and other military actions by land, air and sea by the occupying Israeli forces against the unarmed people of Palestine -- is the embodiment of terrorism in all its aspects. In this context, the Arab delegations reiterate the right of the Arab peoples under the yoke of occupation to use all legitimate means to achieve their independence and self-determination, including armed struggle.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa02">We endorse and support the statement made by the representative of Egypt with regard to the resolution on measures to eliminate international terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa03">The delegation of the Sudan has closely followed the progress of the resolution on measures to eliminate international terrorism up to its adoption by the General Assembly just a few minutes ago. Not only has the Sudan supported all resolutions under this item in the past, but we also took part in bilateral and other contacts conducted to elaborate the draft of the present resolution and to overcome the difficulties encountered with regard to certain paragraphs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa04">My delegation is pleased that the resolution contains a paragraph in which the General Assembly expresses its appreciation and satisfaction that, during the past session, a number of States ratified or acceded to international conventions to eliminate international terrorism. We also take pride in the fact that the Sudan now features prominently on the list of those States that have ratified or acceded to such conventions, in compliance with and in adherence to Sudan's international commitments and in response to the appeals of the General Assembly and the Security Council, as reiterated in its recent statement of 6 December 2000.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa05">The delegation of the Sudan would like to take this opportunity to call upon all States Members of the United Nations to respond favourably to General Assembly resolutions in this connection and to abide fully by the letter and spirit of such resolutions with the objective of eliminating terrorism and on the understanding that terrorism cannot be compartmentalized. As we have seen, the United Nations cannot tolerate any form of State terrorism, which is the major cause of civilian suffering and social chaos in many parts of the world. We certainly believe that the most dangerous form of State terrorism is the recognition of and the material and political support rendered to rebel movements that seek and endorse violence as a means of achieving their political ends.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk03-pa06">We are confident that all members of the Assembly agree that no democracy, no civilized nation, would accept bloodshed as one of its political tools.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The resolution that has just been adopted by the General Assembly is extremely important. It reaffirms the need for the General Assembly fully to exercise its functions in taking effective and strong action in the struggle against international terrorism, including the negotiation of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism containing a precise definition of the crime of terrorism, and the convening of a high-level conference on this issue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The resolution strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms, considering it to be unjustifiable under any circumstances. It emphasizes the need to strengthen cooperation between States and international organizations and agencies in order to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The resolution's call for all Member States to adopt further measures in accordance with the Charter and international law to prevent terrorism is particularly important. It reiterates the General Assembly's appeal to States to refrain from financing, encouraging, providing training for, or otherwise supporting, terrorist activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa04">Our delegation would also like to reaffirm the validity and soundness of all resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on this issue, especially <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-46-51.pdf">resolution 46/51</a>, which establishes the difference between international terrorism and the peoples' struggle for self-determination and against foreign occupation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa05">Cuba wishes to reiterate its strong condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed, including State terrorism or terrorism prompted or tolerated by States. At the same time, we will always oppose double standards and political manipulation of the issue through selective and discriminatory expressions of alleged condemnations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa06">The terrorist activities against Cuba continue to exist. Last 17 November, a plot to murder President Fidel Castro was dismantled in Panama after being revealed by Cuba. The Cuban American National Foundation arranged this plot through Posada Carriles, a well-known international terrorist who was the perpetrator of the 1976 bombing of a Cuban Airline jetliner flying over Barbados, which killed 73 people. Posada Carriles is responsible also for terrorist actions against 28 countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Posada Carriles is now detained in Panama, together with other terrorists from Miami and Central America. They were seized with twenty kilograms of C-4 and 50 packs of Semtex and the blueprints of the central hall of the University of Panama, as well as other evidence proving that they were going to bomb the site during a meeting between President Fidel Castro and thousands of students. They could also have committed acts against other events at the Ibero-American Summit and could seriously have jeopardized the lives of other Presidents.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa08">On 18 November, Cuba initiated an extradition process for the terrorists. On 29 November, Cuba made a formal request to, and is still awaiting a decision from, the Panamanian authorities, to whom Cuba reiterates its respect and confidence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa09">Cuba has guaranteed that due process will be carried out for the terrorists, that they will neither be put to death nor convicted to terms longer than 20 years and has also proposed that an international Latin-American court of law try them in Havana.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa10">Meanwhile, the Government of the United States exerts great pressure on Panama to prevent extradition. This does not surprise us because United States Administrations have for decades organized, financed and carried out numerous terrorist acts against Cuba by using mercenaries such as these, because their policy of aggression, subversion and economic war against Cuba constitutes a direct incentive to terrorism against our country and also because they deliberately and openly allow, on American territory, the existence and actions of the Cuban American National Foundation and other terrorist organizations which continually finance, organize, provide the means for, and carry out, terrorist acts against Cuba.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa11">Posada Carriles is a terrorist who knows many secrets. He was trained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As an officer of the CIA, he worked to bring together the most aggressive anti-Cuban mercenary groups. After the bombing of the jetliner in Barbados, he walked out of a Venezuelan prison while he was being tried and showed up again, receiving salaries from the CIA and State Department and as one of the ringleaders of the Contragate conflict with regard to Nicaragua under Oliver North's command. After that he worked for two Central American Presidents and orchestrated dozens of terrorist acts against Cuba and attempted to murder President Fidel Castro at the Cartagena Ibero-American Summit.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa12">In 1997, Posada Carriles organized a campaign consisting of planting bombs in Havana hotels. He travelled to the United States several times and granted interviews to the New York Times and to Miami's TeleNoticias channel from El Salvador.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa13">The behaviour of the United States does not surprise us, because it is in Miami that the other perpetrator of the jetliner bombing, Orlando Bosch, freely resides and carries out his political activity. Nor are we surprised because it is also in the United States penal courts that anti-Cuban terrorists are historically absolved, as was the case in December 1999 in Puerto Rico with the organizers of an attempt to murder President Fidel Castro on the occasion of the Ibero-American Summit meeting in Margarita Island.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa14">The people of Cuba do not want revenge, but rather a just process and severe sanctions. They wish to act in accordance with the letter and spirit of the resolution we have just adopted. Anything that departs from it will inexorably be an incentive to terrorism against Cuba and a threat to the security of all Member States.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa01">My delegation totally rejects the baseless allegations made by the representative of Egypt on behalf of some other States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Egypt graciously hosted the Sharm el-Sheikh summit, at which an Israeli-Palestinian agreement was reached on ending the violence -- an agreement which are working hard to implement. The summit recognized that neither side in this conflict has a monopoly on the status of victim and that both sides must act to bring about an end to the violence. Indeed, President Mubarak of Egypt spoke there of the need for both sides to return to the peace process in order to end the cycle of violence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa03">In this light, the words of the representative of Egypt, which seek to misrepresent Israel and terrorism, seems at the very best unreflective of Egypt's pronounced and greatly appreciated role as a supporter and facilitator of the Middle East peace process. Such a political manipulation of the resolutions of the United Nations serves only to undermine this Organization, which enjoys the respect of all parties in the region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa04">Certain States, while engaging in political accusations against Israel, continue to maintain that an act of terrorism -- a car bomb in a crowded marketplace, for instance -- is not to be regarded as terrorism if it is claimed to be in the cause of national liberation. Such a position, of course, ignores international law and repeated United Nations resolution, which clearly maintain that terrorism, whatever its form or motivation, is unjustified.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Terrorism is defined by what one does, not by what one does it for. Indeed, defending the bombing of innocents in the name of freedom fighting is simply incomprehensible. The perverse logic of these States would have us believe that those who target crowded buses or marketplaces are not terrorists, while those who seek to stop them are. In so doing, these States do a grave injustice to legitimate liberation movements.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk02-pa06">I did not intend to engage in a polemic debate here. However, I was compelled to respond to the harsh statement made by the representative of Egypt.</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk04">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla" nation="Cuba" language="Spanish">
	Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa01">I have not heard a single valid argument. We have little time, but many truths must be told. I will refute what has been said with several examples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa02">First, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) organized and carried out hundreds of acts of aggression and terrorism against Cuba, including the invasion of Girón -- Bay of Pigs -- and organized dozens of assassination attempts against President Fidel Castro. This was stated by the United States Congress itself in related investigations and has been proved by dozens of declassified United States documents.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa03">Without the encouragement and support of the United States policy of aggression against Cuba, there would be no terrorism against Cuba. If mercenaries had not been recruited, trained and employed for decades, they would not exist today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa04">Secondly, if the United States prosecuted terrorism against Cuba, this would not be happening. The United States is able to listen to conversations throughout the world and to photograph events anywhere on the planet. The CIA alone is investing more than $26 billion in this respect. The United States can trace funds to even the most secret banking accounts. How then can we believe the representative of the United States when he says that his country does not have the knowledge or the ability to do this?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa05">Thirdly, those responsible for the in-flight explosion of a Cuban aircraft coming from Barbados were Orlando Bosch and Posada Carriles. What did the State Department say in a statement that was distributed in the Security Council? It said that the United States did not support or condone the illegal activities of Orlando Bosch. In fact, the opposite is true.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa06">Here are the facts. Bosch is free in Miami today, carrying out political activities and writing for newspapers. In 1968 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a terrorist attack against a Polish vessel and for having threatened to destroy aircraft and ships belonging to Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa07">The North American authorities granted him conditional freedom in 1972. In 1976, he masterminded the in-flight explosion of a Cuban airliner. In 1988, he returned to the United States, where he was arrested. The Department of Justice ordered his deportation, saying it had information indicating that the bombing of a Cuban aircraft had been a United Revolutionary Organization (CORU) operation led by Bosch. But that decision, supported by a Miami court, was later modified by a higher authority -- that is to say, by President Bush. Bosch was given his freedom and allowed to live in the United States. According to <i>The New York Times</i> and the <i>Boston Globe</i>, this was the result of lobbying on the part of Senator Connie Mack, Congresswoman Ileana Ross and Jeb Bush, later a Republican leader in Florida, all of whom remain on the scene.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa08">Fourthly, I can speak in greater detail about the other person, Posada Carriles. He was trained by the CIA in demolition and guerrilla warfare, was an informant of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Miami, was used by the CIA to bring together the most aggressive anti-Cuban terrorist organizations, was responsible for numerous terrorist acts, including a bombing at the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations, was the organizer of the bombing campaign against Havana hotels and was involved in an assassination attempt against President Fidel Castro on Margarita Island.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa09">After the sabotage of the Cuban plane, he resurfaced in Central America and was identified by the American pilot Hasenfus, who was shot down in Nicaragua as being his immediate boss in Contragate. According to the Tower Commission Report, President Reagan was informed of this by then National Security Adviser McFarlane. In subsequent Senate hearings, the CIA official Felix Rodriguez, one of the assassins of Che Guevara, stated that he had participated in organizing Posada's escape from the Venezuelan prison and in his inclusion in Oliver North's group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa10">According to United States Senate records, Posada also collected a salary in San Salvador as Support Director of the Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office -- in other words, the State Department. A memorandum directed to Oliver North that was signed by Owen and Posada Carriles still exist. Posada Carriles was working for the White House in illegal activities and for the State Department in legal activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa11">In 1996, Posada travelled freely to Miami. In June 1998, <i>The New York Times </i>published extensive information showing that the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) financed the bombing campaign against Havana hotels through the Cuban-American Chávez Abarca, a New Jersey resident, using Posada Carriles and Central American mercenaries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa12">In addition to abundant evidence, the Cuban-American National Foundation issued a statement indicating that it supported unreservedly incidents of internal rebellion that had occurred in recent weeks at the island's hotels.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa13">Shortly thereafter, four men travelling by boat were detained by the United States Coast Guard upon leaving Puerto Rico. The group leader, Angel Alfonso Alemán, a New Jersey resident, stated that he was on a mission to kill President Fidel Castro. United States police officials noted that the vessel was registered in the name of a member of the Executive Board of the CANF, that one of the rifles found on board belonged to the President of that Foundation and that the vessel set sail from Coral Gables, Florida, from the private mooring of another Foundation member whose commercial partner is also the treasurer of the Mafia group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa14">The proceedings were also held in Union City, New Jersey. The owner of the vessel confirmed that the weapons were to be used to kill Fidel Castro, and he boasted about having visited the White House on four occasions: once with Reagan, once with Bush and twice with Clinton. He showed a photograph of him with Mr. Clinton, in which he appears with Senator Robert Torricelli. The photograph was taken a year ago at the Helms-Burton legislation signing ceremony.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa15">These are the facts. What does the United States say in the Security Council? In response to the annoying assertions that my Government is hiding Posada Carriles, as far as we know, Posada Carriles is not in the United States. We believe that he is somewhere in Latin America.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa16">In the Special Committee on Terrorism in 1999, it was said that the unfortunate reference -- meaning to the Cuban delegation -- is a matter of public domain and that the United States Government has repeatedly requested the Cuban Government to provide detailed information that could be referred to the authorities responsible for enforcing the law. It is not true. On 3 May 1997, a document was sent to President Clinton by former Senator Gary Hart that contained detailed and sensitive information on a number of terrorist acts against Cuba carried out from the United States between 1992 and 1997.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa17">In June 1998, the United States Government sent a delegation to Cuba, led by a high-level FBI official, which received detailed information. In May 1998, President Clinton was sent a message with detailed information on the plans of the CANF to use Central American mercenaries to attack aircraft flying to Cuba. To date the United States has not taken any practical steps. The United States representative at the Special Committee said, referring to those detained in the attempt on Margarita Island, that those four individuals had been charged and the United States intended to follow the proceedings closely. That was not what happened. In December 1999, a federal court in Puerto Rico shamelessly absolved the terrorists. <i>The New York Times</i> published photographs of the celebration that followed announcement of the verdict at a nearby restaurant, which was attended by the accused and several jurors.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg012-bk04-pa18">In conclusion, some of those detained in Panama are United States residents. Pedro Remón Rodríguez, who lives in Miami, killed an official of the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United States. Guillermo Novo Sampol, a United States resident, fired a bazooka at the United Nations in 1964 and was involved in the murder of Orlando Letelier. Gaspar Jiménez Escobedo, a Miami resident, one of those closely involved with the CANF, participated in the murder of a Cuban official in Mexico, in an assassination attempt against the Ambassador of Cuba to the United Nations and in many attempts against the Cuban President.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa01">My delegation asked for the floor to reply to the allegations made by the representative of the Israeli occupation a little while ago. Our delegation fully supports the statement made by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the Arab Group and also the reply and the explanations made by Egypt just now.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa02">We would like to add that the claims of the representative of the Israeli occupation in his reply -- that he knows international law -- are baseless. Israel's claims regarding peace are just lies and have been exposed as such during the recent bloody days on which hundreds of martyrs -- including children, women, the elderly and unarmed young people -- have been deliberately killed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Is this the international law of which the Israeli representative speaks, and claims that he understands? I do not think so, because this is not international law. International law does not allow the occupation of the land of others by force, nor the perpetration of the most heinous crimes against people under occupation. International law does not allow the innumerable atrocities and massacres that have been perpetrated by Israel in the occupied Arab territories since 1967 -- atrocities and massacres that are documented in United Nations reports, General Assembly resolutions and Security Council resolutions. These are not allegations. Rather, the reports of the Secretariat provide proof of the crimes that have been committed by Israel.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Israel is the country that must be in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records </i>in this regard. Twenty-five Security Council resolutions have mentioned that Israel is the occupying Power, and yet the representative of Israel is still in this room. He should not be here at the United Nations. International law and the Charter of the United Nations require that every country that is a Member of the United Nations be peace-loving. This condition is not respected by Israel and has not been applied to Israel, which, since its inception via a Security Council resolution, has been occupying by force the land and territories of others, namely, the territories of Lebanon, Syria and Palestine.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Were we to apply international law, then the highest penalties should be imposed on Israel to force it to respect international legitimacy and to implement relevant Security Council resolutions, especially resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">242 (1967)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-338(1973).pdf">338 (1973)</a>. Among other things, Israel should immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories to the lines of 4 June 1967. In addition, the establishment of settlements and the arming of settlers to kill the Arabs who own the land, whose land has been occupied by force, is a war crime and a flagrant violation of international law and the Geneva Conventions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa06">The international community should act promptly to intervene to protect unarmed Palestinians who are being killed daily by planes, missiles and rockets and are being subjected to genocide. There are daily assassinations and sniper attacks, and all sorts of weapons are being used to kill people. Confronted by this, the international community should establish a criminal court to bring the Israeli war criminals to justice and should send international troops to protect the Palestinian people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa07">The staff of Mrs. Mary Robinson -- the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights who was asked to investigate the crimes committed by Israel -- have been subjected to aggression by Israeli settlers. There have been attempts to kill her and to prevent her from doing her job.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk01-pa08">The international community knows full well that Israel is the one that lies and commits crimes and that the Arab people, who are subjected every day to genocide, are the ones who need protection and who need the international community to apply international law.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I would not have asked for the floor were it not for the allegations made by the representative of Israel -- allegations that, as usual, distort the facts. This is why the Lebanese delegation would like to express its support for the statement made by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the Arab Group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa02">Lebanon also wants to confirm the explanation of vote it delivered in the Committee after voting on the draft resolution. In it Lebanon emphasized that it fully condemns all acts of terrorism that are part of organized violence. Such acts include killings, assassinations, the taking of hostages, bombings, the hijacking of planes and other acts against civilians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa03">The appeal made to the international community by this resolution to combat terrorism in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations does not conform with the policy of occupation and killing followed by Israel. This appeal supports the position of Lebanon, which calls for making a distinction between State terrorism practised by Israel against civilians and resistance to the forces of occupation, which is protected by international laws and conventions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa04">I would like to remind the representative of Israel, just as an example, that in April 1996 the Israeli occupation forces intentionally bombed a United Nations camp where more than 106 people were seeking protection, including children, the elderly and women. Israel killed these people on purpose. This has been documented and confirmed by a representative of the Secretary-General after an investigation he conducted at the time.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa05">We would also like to remind the Israelis of the bombing of the infrastructure of Lebanon at the beginning of this year. This bombing coincided with threats from more than one Israeli official, such as David Levy, the Foreign Minister, who threatened to burn the Lebanese territories and who threatened the Government, and the Israeli Chief of Staff, Saul Mofaz, who threatened to attack civilians if the Lebanese resistance continued its work against the occupation forces. Israeli aggression and threats against Lebanon and its civilians and its aggression against Palestinians and intentional killings of children -- now having exceeded 300 people -- expose the true uncivilized character of the Israeli policy of occupation and of attacking civilians. This is the real terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg015-bk02-pa06">This policy is regrettable, since Israel is a Member of the United Nations and thus should be committed to respecting the United Nations Charter in its laws and in its actions. However, Israel speaks about international law while it allows the killing of civilians and violates the norms of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as all basic ethical and moral laws. It is true that, as the representative of Israel said, terrorism is defined by what one does and not by what one does it for.</div>

	Mr. Jacob (Israel)

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I deeply regret the tenor of the intervention made by the Syrian representative, which is inappropriate in this Assembly. Although we truly wish to achieve a just, comprehensive and durable peace with our neighbours to the north, we have no delusions regarding the true character of the Syrian Government.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa02">I, like my Syrian colleague, could also use undiplomatic language. I could remind the members of the Assembly that Syria is a dictatorship; Syria is a police State; Syria is a military occupier of almost half of the territory of a neighbouring State; Syria is the exploiter of this neighbouring State's economy and resources; Syria is a cultivator and trafficker of narcotics; Syria is a State that sponsors terrorism; Syria harbours in its capital terrorist organizations and activity that actively and violently oppose the peace process in our region. I could say that Syria brutally murders entire neighbourhoods -- tens of thousands of its own citizens -- in order to silence political dissent. However, I choose not to do so.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Yet, any statement voiced by the delegation of Syria should be considered in the light of these facts, which, although known by all, are diplomatically left unmentioned. It would suffice to say, however, that any Syrian representative's interpretation of the meaning of terrorism is inherently a contradiction of the term. As a matter of fact, when a regime such as that in Syria denigrates any other State for not complying with its view, I would interpret that as a compliment. I would therefore like to thank the representative of Syria for his comments because, coming from him, this unrestrained attack reassures me that Israel is indeed a nation that respects peace, justice and human dignity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa04">With regard to the statement made by the representative of Lebanon, I am bewildered. In the last six months, a radical change has occurred on the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has withdrawn from Lebanon, fulfilling its responsibilities under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a>. The Secretary-General confirmed this complete withdrawal in his report to the Security Council, and the Council endorsed this report and also adopted a resolution to this effect.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk01-pa05">Why then does the Lebanese representative continue to express his anger and frustration over the occupation of his country and the violation of its sovereignty as if nothing has happened? Could it be that these Lebanese sentiments have very little to do with Israel and its actions? Israel has never harboured any aspirations towards Lebanese territory or resources and has always taken action with the sole purpose of maintaining security along its northern border and providing for its own self-defence. Perhaps these Lebanese feelings could be explained by the fact that there is another State neighbouring Lebanon that occupies its soil and violates its sovereignty.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa01">Our delegation abstained from the vote on the resolution just adopted. We abstained because we condemn terrorism in all its manifestations and forms and because this resolution does not contain a clear distinction between the kind of terrorism that we condemn as a crime and the right of people to resist foreign occupation in accordance with international law, international legitimacy and the United Nations Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa02">As for the crimes committed by Israel in the occupied Arab territories, they are examples of international terrorism. The lies of the representative of the Israeli occupation are totally baseless. There is a saying: lie, lie, lie -- maybe it works.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Syria entered Lebanon by request of the Lebanese Government in order to protect Lebanese civilians from Israeli attacks and to apply the resolutions of the Taif Agreement regarding security in Lebanon. This is an internal matter between Syria and Lebanon, and there are brotherly treaties between them, implemented in accordance with the United Nations Charter and international legitimacy. This has nothing to do with the Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the massacres perpetrated by Israel against the Arab people under its occupation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa04">The representative of the Israeli occupation has told lies about Syria, accusations that are not documented or true. We fully reject them. It shows that they have no arguments to submit. They talk only to cover up their own daily crimes in the occupied territories. The United Nations resolutions prove their crimes; the Charter of the United Nations is clear; international law is clear. Israel is the one that occupies Arab territories, and the United Nations resolutions should be applied to force Israel to withdraw from these territories.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa01">We truly regret the interventions of the Israeli representative, who attacks States. We were under the impression that we were discussing the question of terrorism, and we gave examples of Israeli terrorism against civilians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa02">We have cited examples of Israeli terrorism over the 22 years of its occupation of Lebanon's territory and its murder and maiming of Lebanese civilians and children with a variety of prohibited and unprohibited weapons. We had thought that this was the question under consideration, but when we gave our supporting arguments, the representative of Israel chose to discuss another issue, since he had no answer to our rightful accusations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa03">First, I would remind him that his country occupied Lebanon for 22 years, in contravention of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a>, which Israel flouted all that time. Secondly, we would ask what the Israelis are doing in the Sheba'a farmlands, which they continue to occupy and where they have increased their military presence. Does this military escalation in an occupied territory demonstrate a desire for peace or for war? Finally, we would remind the representative of Israel that the relationship between Lebanon and Syria is that of brothers. There is a cooperation and coordination agreement between the two countries; it is not a relation based on occupation, as the representative of Israel has depicted it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk02-pa04">Here, we would inquire about the fate of the 19 Lebanese civilian hostages kidnapped by the Israeli forces from their homes and currently held as hostages in Israeli prisons, a fact acknowledged by the Israeli Supreme Court. Is this not terrorism?</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk20-pa01">Before we take up the items on the agenda for this morning, I would like to make an announcement concerning the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on the Law of the Sea.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk20-pa02">Members will recall that the General Assembly, by its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-33.pdf">resolution 54/33</a> of 24 November 1999, decided to establish an open-ended informal consultative process, in order to facilitate the annual review by the General Assembly of developments in ocean affairs by considering the Secretary-General's report on oceans and the law of the sea. It also decided that the meetings of this process would be coordinated by two co-chairpersons, who would be appointed by the President of the General Assembly, in consultation with Member States and taking into account the need for representation from developed and developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk20-pa03">In this regard, the first meeting of the Consultative Process was held at United Nations Headquarters from 30 May to 2 June 2000. The meeting was co-chaired by the Permanent Representative of Samoa to the United Nations, Ambassador Tuiloma Slade, and Mr. Alan Simcock of the United Kingdom, who were appointed by my predecessor.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk20-pa04">Members will further recall that the General Assembly, by its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-55-7.pdf">resolution 55/7</a> of 30 October 2000, requests the Secretary-General to convene the second meeting of the Consultative Process, to be held in New York from 7 to 11 May 2001.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk20-pa05">With regard to the co-chairpersonships of the second meeting of the Consultative Process next year, I have conducted extensive consultations, both through the chairs of regional groups and through a significant number of individual delegations, representing all regions. During these consultations wide support was expressed for the co-chairpersons of the first meeting of the Consultative Process. Both of them were highly praised for their excellence as mediators and consensus-builders.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk20-pa06">It is therefore my great pleasure to announce my decision to re-appoint Ambassador Tuiloma Slade, Permanent Representative of Samoa to the United Nations, and Mr. Alan Simcock of the United Kingdom as the two co-chairpersons of the second meeting of the Consultative Process. However, some Member States also expressed the view that there may be a need to consider rotating the co-chairpersonship of this process. Thus, I should like to urge interested Member States to consider the issue of rotation as early as possible and to submit distinct nominations, through the appropriate channels, in regard to the co-chairpersons of the third meeting of the Consultative Process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk20-pa07">As delegations will have noted from this morning's  <i>Journal</i>, and while on the subject of appointments, I would also like to indicate that -- in the Working Group, after the plenary meeting is adjourned -- I will be making an announcement of a similar nature concerning the Vice-Chairpersons of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council. The meeting of the Working Group will take place in this Hall immediately following the adjournment of this meeting.</div>
