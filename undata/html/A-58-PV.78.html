	<p id="pg012-bk07-pa01">My delegation deeply regrets that the substantive debate in the Second Committee this year was once again used as a platform from which to level accusations against Israel and to adopt a draft resolution which is completely one-sided, inaccurate and, ultimately, counterproductive.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk07-pa02">The draft resolution before us has nothing to do with the issues addressed by the Second Committee, and it shifts the focus of our work from those activities identified by Member States as priorities. Its adoption will only invite the further politicization of the work of the Second Committee by the Palestinians, as well as by others, and will further distract us from the important work on our agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk07-pa03">As we sought this year to strengthen the Organization by aligning the work of the Second Committee with the priorities outlined in the outcomes of the major international conferences, it appears that this politically motivated item, whose impact is dubious, might have been an appropriate place from which to start the process of rationalizing and harmonizing our work.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk07-pa04">Moreover, the draft resolution will contribute nothing to the achievement of a lasting peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, as it prejudges issues that the sides had agreed would be addressed through direct bilateral negotiations, thus undermining the bilateral spirit of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk07-pa05">As in past years, Israel will vote against this biased and counterproductive draft resolution. We urge other delegations to do the same.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa01">I have the honour to present draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.17-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/58/L.17/Rev.1</a>, under sub-item (a) of agenda item 39 of the General Assembly, entitled "New Partnership for Africa's Development: progress in implementation and international support". The draft resolution is based on the general debate in the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly, including the proposal made therein on the report of the Secretary-General, entitled "The New Partnership for Africa's Development: first consolidated report on progress in implementation and international support" (<a href="../pdf/A-58-254.pdf" class="pdf">A/58/254</a>). The negotiations were smooth, and there was consensus on the content of various parts of the draft resolution. The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is an important framework for achieving accelerated growth and economic and sustainable development in Africa. NEPAD recognizes that peace and security and good governance, including, among other things, the rule of law, transparency and respect for human rights, are important to attaining sustained growth and sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa02">In its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-7.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 57/7</a> of 4 November 2002, the General Assembly adopted NEPAD as the framework within which the international community, including the United Nations, should focus its efforts for Africa's development. The Group of Eight (G-8) countries have also made NEPAD the framework for their support to Africa. The principles of ownership and partnership of the Third Tokyo International Conference on African Development will also support the implementation of NEPAD.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa03">While recognizing that progress has been made in the implementation of the objectives and priorities of NEPAD, the draft resolution calls upon Member States and the international community, including the United Nations, to announce their support in moving forward with the implementation of NEPAD.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa04">This draft resolution welcomes the efforts of African countries in the management and resolution of conflicts in the region, as well as the progress made in the African Peer Review Mechanism, particularly with regard to the accession of a number of States members of the African Union and the appointment of the panel of eminent persons for the African Peer Review Mechanism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa05">The draft resolution further recognizes the efforts made by African countries in raising awareness of NEPAD and involving all stakeholders, namely, Governments, the private sector and civil society, including women's organizations, in the implementation of NEPAD. It also heralds the decision of the African Union's Executive Council to integrate NEPAD into the African Union structures and processes.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa06">The issue of adequate external financial resources for the implementation of NEPAD is a critical one. In this regard, the draft resolution welcomes the pledges made by the development partners for increased official development assistance, including to the untying of such assistance. The draft resolution stresses the need to find a durable solution to Africa's external debt problem, especially for heavily indebted poor countries in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa07">Equally important is the issue of increased market access through trade and the need for developed countries and their partners to support the promotion of private investment, particularly in the key sectors of African economies. The draft resolution further recognizes the need to take concrete steps to implement the existing frameworks for South-South cooperation, including through triangular cooperation in the implementation of NEPAD.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa08">The draft resolution notes with satisfaction the growing collaboration among the entities of the United Nations system and encourages them to continue such efforts to support the implementation of NEPAD. It also welcomes the creation of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa09">The draft resolution further requests the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report to the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly on the implementation of NEPAD based on the inputs from various stakeholders.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa10">I wish to express the African Group's appreciation to all members of the Group of 77 and China for their strong support during the negotiation process. We also thank them for sponsoring this draft resolution, together with a number of other countries. Among those who have joined us in sponsorship are the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Spain and Sweden.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa11">Before presenting this draft resolution for adoption, there is a slight correction I would like to make in the second last line of the sixth preambular paragraph. As it now appears, it is the "African Partnership Forum". In fact, it should read "Africa Partnership Forum".</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa12">I wish to present, through you, Mr. President, this draft resolution for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa13">I am now pleased to introduce the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.56.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.56</a>. This draft appears under agenda item 39 (b) and is entitled "Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa".</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa14">The draft resolution is based on the general debate in the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly, including the proposals made therein on the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa" (<a href="../pdf/A-58-352.pdf" class="pdf">A/58/352</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa15">The Secretary-General's report underscores the nexus between peace and development. NEPAD also recognizes peace and security as an important precondition for Africa's development. The recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's 1998 report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa (<a href="../pdf/A-52-871.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/871</a>) are as pertinent and relevant to the African situation today as they were when the report was submitted in 1998 to the Security Council and subsequently to the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. As such, the draft resolution reaffirms that the implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General's report must remain a priority on the agenda of the United Nations and Member States, and that the General Assembly must continue to play the primary role in monitoring progress in the implementation of the recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa16">The draft resolution reaffirms that the responsibility for peace and security lies primarily with African countries as well as with regional and subregional organizations, and welcomes the efforts of African countries towards establishing a peace and security council of the African Union, while it encourages African Union member States that have not yet ratified the protocol to do so. It welcomes the decision of the European Union to establish a peace facility to support the establishment of the African Peace and Security Mechanism to support African efforts and peace initiatives. It also welcomes the establishment of the Security Council's Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa and the Economic and Social Council's Ad Hoc Advisory Group on African countries emerging from conflict, such as Guinea-Bissau and Burundi. In addition, it underscores that Member States and the United Nations system should support efforts in conflict prevention and post-conflict development through enhanced coordination, coherence and sustained financial and political support.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa17">The draft resolution recognizes that poverty eradication is a critical challenge to achieving sustained economic growth and development. The draft resolution calls upon Member States to provide adequate support to eradicate poverty and to strengthen institutions to maintain the rule of law, transparency and accountable public administration.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa18">The draft resolution notes with concern that progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General's report remains slow and uneven, and it notes the need to continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations. In that regard, it welcomes the designation of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa to continue to monitor -- through the already-established interdepartmental task force on African affairs -- progress in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report. It further requests the Secretary-General to report on the progress made in the implementation of the resolution to the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk06-pa19">In submitting this draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly, I wish to express the appreciation of the African Group to all members of the Group of 77 and China for their support during the negotiation process. We also wish to thank them, together with a number of other countries, for sponsoring the draft resolution. Among those that have joined the list of sponsors recently are Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Mozambique, Netherlands, Rwanda, Singapore and Sweden.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chidumo</span> <span class="nation">Mozambique</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the African Union, I have the honour to introduce the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.55.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.55</a>, entitled "International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda". I am pleased to announce that the following countries have joined the list of sponsors: Ethiopia, Germany, Greece, Mauritius, the Republic of Korea, Somalia, Sweden, Uganda and the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">From April to July 1994, we witnessed in Rwanda one of the most despicable acts of genocide in the history of mankind when up to 1 million people were brutally murdered in a tragedy in which Rwandans, Africans and, ultimately, humanity at large were the victims. The genocide in Rwanda remains a vivid memory of the cruelty that Rwandans have endured, and it requires us to reflect on the matter with a view to preventing it from ever happening again.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">Within the framework of preventing and dealing with the wounds of genocide, the Executive Council of the African Union decided, at its second ordinary session, held in 2002 in Ndjamena, to recommend the proclamation of an International Day of Reflection on the 1994Genocide in Rwanda and recommitment to the fight against genocide throughout the world. That recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the second ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union, held in Maputo in July 2003. It was therefore on instruction from the heads of State and Government of the African Union that we tabled this draft resolution, which, if adopted, would mainly decide to designate 7 April 2004 as the International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in Rwanda and seek the solidarity and commitment of the international community at large in observing that day through relevant commemorative activities.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">The International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda would enable us to honour the memory of those innocent men, women, children and elderly persons who died at the hands of extremist killers in Rwanda. The International Day of Reflection would also enable us to recommit ourselves to ensuring that genocide never happens again anywhere on our planet. As the international community, we must ensure that our "never again" really means "never again". To that end, the draft resolution calls on all States to ensure that there is no repetition of the kind of event that occurred in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">It is the wish of the sponsors that this draft resolution be adopted by consensus. In that regard, I call upon all Member States to show their solidarity by adopting the draft resolution by consensus.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk04-pa02">By its <a href="../pdf/A-RES-57-300.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 57/300</a> of 20 December 2002, the General Assembly approved the transfer of the resources allocated to the Office of the Special Coordinator for Africa and the Least Developed Countries and those from the Office of the Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa, to the new Office of the Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser on Africa, and requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the new Office is reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 with the allocation of adequate resources for its expanded mandate. The Assembly also entrusted that Office with responsibility for, inter alia, coordinating and guiding the preparation of Africa-related reports and inputs, in particular support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development, and for coordinating the interdepartmental task force on African affairs to ensure the coherence of and an integrated approach to United Nations support for Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk04-pa03">Provisions for these activities have already been included in section 11 of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, United Nations support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

	<p id="pg018-bk10-pa01">Over the past decade, we have continued to witness events which make a mockery of declarations of "never again". Appropriately commemorating the horrific events of April 1994 is essential to understanding not just our past failures, but also our future responsibilities. For the United Nations to remain relevant, we must not avert our eyes from such atrocities because some Members insist on a narrow interpretation of sovereignty -- one that implies only privileges, not responsibilities. We should acknowledge that States have a fundamental responsibility to protect their people, and that there is a related responsibility of the international community to take action to prevent or halt genocide or other atrocities when the State in question is unable or unwilling to do so, as was so tragically the case in Rwanda.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mahbubani</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa01">In the interests of saving time, I will not read out the full text of my explanation of position, as I believe the text will be circulated shortly.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa02">At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation to you, Mr. President, for putting forward this important draft resolution, entitled "Follow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special session: implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS". I would also like to commend my good friend Mr. Denis Dangue Réwaka, the Permanent Representative of Gabon, and his colleagues, for having held successful consultations on behalf of the Office of the President. We believe that the adoption by the General Assembly of the draft resolution before us today will help to keep the international community focused on combating the scourge of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Singapore has requested this opportunity to state its full support for the global effort to combat HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa03">The HIV/AIDS pandemic has grown into a global crisis of staggering proportions. The latest statistics on the disease make for sobering reading. According to the joint report by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, <i>AIDS Epidemic Update 2003</i>, an estimated 40 million people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa04">Sub-Saharan Africa has been by far the worst affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Southern Africa alone accounts for about 30 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide -- yet this region has less than 2 per cent of the world's population. In its World Health Report 2003, the World Health Organization noted that HIV/AIDS has cut life expectancy by as much as 20 years for millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa05">At his press conference on 18 December 2003, the Secretary-General described combating HIV/AIDS as one of the Organization's top priorities for the coming year. He noted that the epidemic was killing 8,000 people a day. He rightly pointed out that, for the countries worst afflicted by HIV/AIDS -- like South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia -- the AIDS epidemic is a "real weapon of mass destruction".</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa06">Amid the gloom of the current HIV/AIDS crisis, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria stands out as a beacon of hope in combating the epidemic. As a partnership among Governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities, the Global Fund represents an innovative approach to international health financing. Global Fund grants will support a major scaling-up of HIV treatment. Over the next five years, more than 500,000 people will begin to receive antiretroviral treatment, representing a near tripling of coverage in poor countries, including more than a sixfold increase in Africa. In line with the Secretary-General's recent call for the Global Fund to be fully funded, I am pleased to announce that Singapore will be contributing $1 million over five years to the Fund, beginning in 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa07">As part of a region where the epidemic is rapidly growing, Singapore also faces the challenge of combating HIV/AIDS. Hence, we have made prevention of the disease a key priority. We have adopted a comprehensive, multisectoral national AIDS control programme. At the regional and international levels, Singapore cooperates actively with the Association of South-East Asian Nations to control the spread of HIV/AIDS in South-East Asia. And, at the international level, Singapore cooperates with the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa08">The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a serious global problem and poses one of the greatest challenges to mankind. It is only right that the international community continue to pay serious attention and to redouble its efforts to address this mounting global crisis. That is why we are very pleased to support the draft resolution before us for consideration.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">I call on the representative of Brazil, who wishes to speak in explanation of position on the resolution just adopted.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Meyer</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa01">Brazil wishes to offer an explanation of position following the adoption of the resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.54.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.54</a>, on the follow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special session.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa02">We attach high priority to the implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, and we welcome the adoption of this resolution by consensus. There is no doubt that HIV/AIDS represents one of the greatest challenges of our time. We must send a strong signal on the urgent need for strengthening and accelerating the global response to the pandemic.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa03">As made clear by my delegation throughout the negotiating process, we remain concerned that the ninth preambular paragraph contains the expression "emphasis on prevention measures" and that operative paragraph 5 (d) (i) refers to the statement "prevention is the mainstay of the national, regional and international response". For there to be any real hope of success in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, we must acknowledge that prevention, care, support and treatment are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response. They must be integrated into a comprehensive approach to combat the epidemic. The provision contained in the eighth preambular paragraph must be our guiding principle.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa04">"Prevention" refers to measures aimed at protecting non-infected persons from contracting HIV. Nevertheless, people infected with HIV/AIDS need care, support and treatment. We cannot abandon the 42 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS. We must therefore address prevention and treatment on the same footing and with the same emphasis. And we say that on the basis of our concrete accomplishments.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa05">Brazil's positive experience related to the effects of free and universal access to medication, including antiretroviral therapy, is widely acknowledged. Since 1996, we have seen AIDS-related mortality slashed by 50 per cent. Hospital admissions have dropped 75 per cent. Opportunistic illnesses have been drastically reduced. The positive consequences of this cost-effective policy are far-reaching. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS today in Brazil -- 1 million -- is half of what the World Bank foresaw a decade ago for the year 2003. The successful results that Brazil has achieved in its fight against HIV/AIDS are the outcome of a strong approach to both prevention and treatment as well as human rights advocacy.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa06">The global response to HIV/AIDS must be commensurate with the scale of the pandemic. It is a tragedy that, in addition to the 42 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS, the pandemic claimed more than 3 million lives in 2003 and has orphaned 14 million children. It must also be noted with profound concern that an estimated 5.5 million people in low-and middle-income countries are considered in need of antiretroviral therapy, but that only an estimated 300,000 are receiving those medicines.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa07">Hence, the emergency to which operative paragraph 3 refers means the global health emergency: the failure to deliver antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS to the millions of people who need it, as defined by UNAIDS and the World Health Organization. It is a notion contained in the resolution entitled "Access to medication in the context of pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria", adopted yesterday by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa08">In the eleventh preambular paragraph, we are reaffirming the importance of the elimination of all forms of discrimination against people living with or at risk of HIV/AIDS, including those most vulnerable. And we must be reminded that no grounds for discrimination -- including sexual orientation -- to prevent the full enjoyment of human rights are legitimate.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa09">In operative paragraph 6, we welcome with appreciation the Doha Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health and the World Trade Organization's decision of 30 August on a mechanism to give developing countries that cannot produce cheap generic drugs the right to import them from other countries that can. It is imperative to work to implement that agreement to provide for better access to low-cost and effective drugs and related pharmaceutical products. And it is equally imperative that the international community support developing countries in achieving the "3 by 5" target, as mentioned in operative paragraph 7.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk03-pa10">Mr. President, my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to your Office and to Ambassador Denis Dangue Réwaka, Permanent Representative of Gabon, the facilitator of the informal consultations, for his dedication in helping Member States to reach consensus on this resolution. We also request that this statement be made part of the official record.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa01">Members will recall that the General Assembly held a debate on this agenda item at its 41st plenary meeting, on 22 October 2003. In this connection, the Assembly has before it a draft resolution, issued as <a href="../pdf/A-58-L.53.pdf" class="pdf">document A/58/L.53</a>.

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kumalo</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa01">On behalf of all countries concerned about malaria, I would like to express my deep appreciation for all the delegations who cooperated in ensuring smooth progress and a positive outcome to the negotiations on the draft resolution before the Assembly today under item 51.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa02">As the Assembly knows, malaria is one of Africa's deadliest diseases. In fact, malaria remains the single biggest cause of death worldwide, especially among children. At least 1 million children die of malaria each year, 90 per cent of them in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease places an enormous burden on the healthcare systems of poor countries, and, like HIV/AIDS, is a major factor in slowing economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa03">I have the honour to introduce this draft resolution on behalf of Cameroon, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, the Gambia, Japan, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, the Sudan, Sweden, Togo and Uganda.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk04-pa04">The draft resolution calls on the international community to support ways of developing the manufacturing capacity of insecticide-treated nets in Africa and to facilitate the transfer of technology to make those nets more effective and long-lasting. The need for effective, prompt, affordable and quality treatment is also of the utmost importance. We stress those recommendations in particular because African countries may not be able to meet the targets set at the Abuja Summit or at the Millennium Summit if serious efforts are not made to scale-up successful programmes. That will require additional resources. The draft resolution calls on the international community to renew efforts to ensure that the fight against malaria receives adequate funding to support sound national plans to control malaria in endemic countries, countries which are often found among the poorest. It is clear that without making progress on malaria the other critical Millennium Development Goals will not be met in Africa by 2015.</p>
