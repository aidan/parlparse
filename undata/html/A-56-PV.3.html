	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa01">Forgive me for coming in now. I am actually speaking in support of this issue being considered in plenary. However, I just want to point out that in the light of the fact that we have been advised that we cannot bring our high-level officials into the city at this stage because of the tragedy affecting the people of the city of New York, it should be noted that we from the African Group -- and I am sure I am speaking for the entire group -- have been advised that our ministers can come only when the new date of the general debate has been set. When the debate on this subject takes place, we will not be able to be represented at the highest level because we have advised our capitals to cancel their schedules and await a new date being set for the general debate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk05-pa02">I just want to put that on record because, if the meeting does take place and some other regions are represented at the ministerial level or higher, it should not be read as a statement that those of us from Africa did not want to participate in it. We are fully in support and think this is a wonderful idea, but, frankly, we would have preferred that this debate take place in the general debate, when we would really be represented at the highest level with no doubt whatsoever. If it needs to take place sooner, that is fine, but let us put this on record so that a certain impression will not be created by our possibly coming at a lower level of representation than other regions.</div>
