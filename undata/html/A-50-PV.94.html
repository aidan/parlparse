	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I call upon Mr. Andre Erdös, Deputy State Secretary of Hungary, to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.62.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.62</a> and draft decision <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.63</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Erdös</span> <span class="nation">Hungary</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">I welcome this opportunity to participate in this debate as the personal representative of the Chairman-in-Office of an important international body, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The fact that the Secretary-General's report on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe advocates the maintenance and strengthening of the constructive working relationship that has been established between the two organizations bodes well for the future and must be further consolidated on the basis of a rational division of labour between the United Nations and the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Hungary, which this year is assuming the chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE, has consistently devoted particular attention to the development of cooperation between that body and other organizations and institutions with a similar calling. The United Nations occupies a very special place in this respect. This is reflected in the declaration of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Summit, held in Helsinki in 1992, which stated that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe</p>
	<blockquote id="pg003-bk02-pa03">"is a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, and as such provides an important link between European and global security" <i>(<a href="../pdf/A-50-L.62.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.62</a>, second preambular paragraph)</i>.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">This position was subsequently confirmed at the Budapest Summit of 1994, at which, in order to highlight the role of the CSCE in maintaining security on the continent as well as the institutional changes that had taken place within it, the Conference was transformed into an Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">In this respect, special mention should be made of the increasingly frequent and fruitful contacts being developed between the participating States of the OSCE and their cooperation partners in the regions neighbouring the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">Since the Budapest Summit, the two organizations have been continually developing and strengthening their cooperation links in the political and organizational areas. Their representatives are deploying joint efforts in humanitarian activities, in the monitoring of respect for human rights and in the implementation of measures stemming from sanction regimes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">Thus, shortly after the beginning of the year, the chairmanship-in-office of the OSCE agreed with high-level officials of the United Nations Secretariat to hold regular consultations between the two organizations. This agreement was confirmed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE at the meetings they held throughout this year. The implementation of this agreement began in April, when, within the framework of an exchange of views, several officials and experts from the United Nations Secretariat reviewed, together with an OSCE delegation that was visiting New York, the various aspects of United Nations peace-keeping operations. On behalf of the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, I take this opportunity to thank the members of the Secretariat for their valuable assistance, which contributed greatly and in a concrete manner to preparing the OSCE to undertake similar actions.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">I should like also to stress that the representatives to the United Nations of the country currently holding the chairmanship in office of the OSCE very much appreciated the excellent informal working relationships they had this year with their Secretariat colleagues.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">Also noteworthy are the follow-up contacts that were established between the secretariat staff of the United Nations and of the OSCE in New York, Geneva and Vienna. In this respect, particular mention should be made of the series of meetings held between the Secretary-General of the OSCE and his United Nations partners during the session commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. As a result of those consultations -- and as another example of the implementation of the 1993 framework agreement for cooperation between the two organizations -- a memorandum of understanding was signed last October on coordinating the actions of the OSCE and of the United Nations in central Asia and on local cooperation among their representatives in Tashkent.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa10">The initiative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in arranging a meeting next February, for the second time, between representatives of the United Nations and the regional organizations will further enrich the mutually advantageous cooperation between the world Organization and the OSCE, and will help identify new and concrete forms for this cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa11">The true touchstone of our cooperation is our joint activity in the settlement of conflicts. From this point of view, we attach great importance to the support provided by the United Nations in the preparation and eventual implementation of the peace-keeping operation that the OSCE is planning to undertake in the Nagorny Karabakh region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa12">Another broad-ranging area of cooperation for the two organizations has been provided by their active participation in the settlement process in the former Yugoslavia. The tasks incumbent upon the OSCE and the United Nations were set out in the Peace Agreement initialled in Dayton and signed in Paris. They were laid down specifically at the London Conference on the implementation of the civilian aspects of the Agreement. A subsequent series of meetings is also planned in order to promote the implementation of the various specific sections of the Dayton Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa13">In this context, we attach great importance to the fact that the United Nations and the OSCE are carrying out joint coordinated actions, relying on their comparative advantages in areas where one or the other would take on a key role. I have in mind primarily the monitoring of human rights, including those of national minorities, and the establishment of conditions that would allow refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes. The immensity and the complexity of this undertaking should be obvious to all.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa14">One cannot underestimate the seriousness of the deadlines facing the international community. The OSCE, for its part, faces the most difficult challenge in its history. As an integral part of the crucial undertaking of restoring peace to the regions of the former Yugoslavia ravaged by deadly conflict and of establishing the rule of law in other regions of the former federation, the OSCE can make a decisive contribution by organizing democratic elections in the next six to nine months in Bosnia and Herzegovina and by fully playing its role in Croatia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa15">The OSCE and the United Nations are specifically mentioned in the conclusions of the London Conference. As is well known, the Conference established a Peace Implementation Council, whose work will be guided by a Steering Board. According to the conclusions of the Conference, the OSCE and the United Nations will have the right to participate in the activities of the Steering Board when it considers matters that fall within the competence of one or the other organization. Needless to say, this represents an impressive array of issues, and the OSCE, for its part, is counting upon being associated as closely as possible with the activities of the Steering Board.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa16">I have the honour of submitting to the General Assembly, on behalf of 51 countries, the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.62.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/L.62</a> on cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE. The following States have been added to the original list of sponsors: Albania, Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and Tajikistan. The draft resolution accurately reflects the main areas of activity and consideration of this regional organization. The draft rightly emphasizes the complementarity of the work of the United Nations and that of the OSCE in the maintenance of security in the OSCE region and on a global scale. The sponsors hope that this draft resolution will be adopted by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa17">Upon the expiration of its term as Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, Hungary would like to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer to its successor, Switzerland, of the matters it has dealt with this year. While wishing our Swiss colleagues good luck and success in the complex tasks awaiting them at the head of the OSCE, I wish to take this opportunity to introduce draft decision <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.63</a>, which allows Switzerland, which is a non-member of the United Nations, to submit documents on behalf of the OSCE and to participate at the United Nations, if necessary, regarding matters that affect the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa18">With the Assembly's permission, I shall read out the text of draft decision <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.63</a>, and I ask the Assembly to support its adoption. The text reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa19">"The General Assembly decides to authorize Switzerland, on an ad hoc basis, as the State holding the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe during the period from 1 January to 31 December 1996, to submit communications on behalf of the States members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for circulation as United Nations documents and to participate in discussions in the General Assembly that are of direct concern for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, during the period in question."</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Türk</span> <span class="nation">Slovenia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Slovenia is among the sponsors of the draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-50-L.62.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.62</a>) before the General Assembly, and we hope that both the draft resolution and the draft decision (<a href="../pdf/A-50-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.63</a>) will be adopted by consensus. In addition, we would like to contribute several thoughts which we believe are pertinent at this stage of our reflection on the cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">More than 20 years has elapsed since the signing of the Helsinki Final Act on Security and Cooperation in Europe. A year ago the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was established. The present discussion on the cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE offers an opportunity to reflect on both the experience gained in the past and the necessary steps for the future.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The process of security and cooperation in Europe over the last 20 years has passed through several stages which have been defined by the general evolution of the political and security situation in Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Initially the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) was perceived differently by its different members. Some saw it as an instrument for the preservation of the political and social status quo, while others wished it to be a vehicle of change. Some emphasized its security aspect, while others gave preference to human rights and the human dimension in general. During its first decade the CSCE was paralysed as a result of the cold-war confrontation, which was most clearly manifested in Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Towards the end of the 1980s it became possible for the CSCE to develop its human dimension into a powerful instrument of real social and political transformation in Europe. The situation in Europe started to change radically, and the CSCE instruments of human rights were of critical importance in this context. That was probably the finest hour in the history of the CSCE to date.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The period immediately following the end of the cold war was less successful. The CSCE was unable to develop into a workable and practical framework for peaceful change. To a large extent it remained hostage to the perceptions inherited from the cold-war era. It missed the opportunity to grasp the necessary changes in the territorial status quo that prevailed up until that time and to assume a meaningful role in their management. Like other systems based on cooperation among sovereign member States, the CSCE was able to deliver as much as the wisdom and political will of its members allowed. In this sense, the CSCE relearned the lesson that is well known in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">That new era brought not only a radically changed political and security landscape but also a substantially enlarged CSCE membership. In the last four years its membership has increased by one third, a factor of considerable political and practical importance.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">I recall these facts simply to recall that the OSCE and the United Nations have been confronted with tasks of considerable magnitude. It is most likely that the near future will be equally demanding. Hence the need to very carefully reflect on the common tasks, the division of labor, the means of coordination and cooperation and the nature of future relationships between the United Nations and the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">It is clear that the OSCE needs to develop and to make more specific its vision of security issues in Europe for the coming years. Without a realistic and sufficiently operational vision for dealing with the basic security and political issues in the region, the OSCE will not be able to play an active role and will react to emerging situations in a random and not necessarily successful manner.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">Slovenia therefore welcomes the decision on a common and comprehensive security model for Europe for the twenty-first century, adopted at the recent Budapest meeting of the ministerial Council -- a new concept for a new century.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">We believe that the new security model must be built on the foundations which have so far instilled confidence in Europe: transparency of intentions, dialogue and multilateral cooperation. Furthermore, the new security model ought to achieve two objectives: to expand the area of stability and, at the same time, provide effective means to enable crisis-ravaged areas to be integrated into the European security space.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">These are ambitious objectives. However, nothing less than the achievement of these objectives will guarantee stability and security in Europe in the coming century.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa13">It will be very important in the process of building a new security model for due consideration to be given to the need both for security issues to be addressed in a comprehensive manner and for the right focus to be given to the priority issues as the elaboration of the security model proceeds.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa14">The annex to the decision on the common and comprehensive security model provides a fairly exhaustive list of security issues to be addressed. That list constitutes an appropriate basis for work towards a comprehensive model.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa15">Moreover, we are heartened to see in that decision that the OSCE members have committed themselves to respecting</p>
	<blockquote id="pg005-bk01-pa16">"the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve." <i>(<a href="../pdf/A-49-800.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/800</a>, annex, Budapest decision VII, "A common and comprehensive security model for Europe for the twenty-first century", first paragraph)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa17">"Each will respect the rights of all others in this regard." (Ibid., <i>Budapest decision IV, "Code of conduct on politico-military aspects of security", para. 11)</i></p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa18">The language quoted is an important expression of the principle requiring that regional arrangements be freely agreed upon by the participating States. Let me mention, in passing, that this principle is of universal importance and has been recently reaffirmed in the United Nations -- in the guidelines and recommendations for regional approaches to disarmament within the context of global security, adopted by the United Nations Disarmament Commission and endorsed by the General Assembly in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-75.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 48/75</a> G of 16 December 1993.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa19">The practical relevance of this principle in the present situation in Europe will be most clearly visible in the efforts for the further development of various subregional arrangements. Only consistent respect for the right of free choice can ensure that the new or modified arrangements will be tailored to respond to the actual security needs and genuinely shared common interests. Only on such a basis will it be possible to make these arrangements mutually supportive and the functioning of the general model effective.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa20">It goes without saying that the future security models do not depend primarily on the soundness of ideas or on their conceptual quality and coherence. While all these ingredients are extremely important, they depend vitally on the ability of an organisation to cope with the actual security situations at hand. Here, the challenges before the OSCE are great, and cooperation with the United Nations is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa21">The Chairman's summary of the Fifth Meeting of the Ministerial Council lists a variety of specific situations that are currently being addressed by the OSCE and its diverse mechanisms. Among these, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina represents the most complex task and "an unprecedented challenge", as recognized in the relevant decision of the Ministerial Council. Cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations will clearly be necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa22">It is appropriate that the General Assembly should carefully reflect on the nature of that cooperation in the immediate future. This is necessary because the success of the OSCE depends to a very large extent on the effectiveness of the United Nations and its future activities. The preparation of free, democratic and fair elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the responsibility of the OSCE. However, that responsibility cannot be fulfilled without certain conditions. Among these, the need to prosecute and punish the major war criminals and to start the process of meaningful repatriation of refugees is particularly important. How can free, fair and democratic elections take place without prior fulfilment of these conditions?</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa23">Therefore, the United Nations must do its utmost to ensure that the Hague Tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia is effective. The work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the voluntary repatriation of refugees must receive full support. The Security Council ought to remember that it created the war-crimes Tribunal and that further measures may be necessary to guarantee its effectiveness. The General Assembly should follow the situation closely and make the necessary recommendations to the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa24">In short, with respect to elections and, more generally, with respect to the future of human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the OSCE depends on proper implementation of the tasks assumed by the United Nations. This situation of dependence has created an additional responsibility for the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa25">In addition to the basic conditions for the establishment of a real and durable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a need to provide an appropriate political environment for long-term stability and cooperation in the region. It is not premature to think very carefully about the essential elements for the creation of such a political environment.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa26">These elements include mutual recognition between the successor States to the former Yugoslavia, which has ceased to exist; equitable settlement of the issues of State succession; and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the successor States. Slovenia has already recognized all the other four successor States resulting from the dissolution and extinction of the former Yugoslavia, and has been recognized by all four. Diplomatic relations have been established between Slovenia and three other successor States. We have also proposed the establishment of diplomatic relations between Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa27">We believe that early recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations between all five successor States to the former Yugoslavia would contribute to political stability in that part of Europe and would accelerate the process of negotiations on the outstanding issues of State succession concerning State property and debt, as well as State archives. It would also help in the future efforts to resolve the pending questions of State succession with respect to successor States' membership of international organizations. Here, as in respect of all other aspects of State succession, it is necessary that the principle of the equality of all five successor States to the former Yugoslavia be carefully observed. These States must fulfil the same substantive and procedural conditions for membership in the United Nations and in other international organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa28">I have discussed the issues related to Bosnia and Herzegovina in some detail as particular responsibility with respect to these has been assumed both by the OSCE and by the United Nations. Today, the United Nations has an opportunity to contribute to a just and durable peace by taking the right decisions in the months to come and by creating some of the important conditions for the success of the activities of the OSCE. This opportunity should not be missed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa29">Let me note, before closing, that the agenda of the OSCE has been expanded and diversified -- a feature that will provide an important new opportunity for cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations in the future. The OSCE is in the process of preparing for its own peace-keeping operations. Here, the experience of the United Nations may help the OSCE, both to make the right decisions and to avoid the wrong ones.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa30">On the other hand, the OSCE has developed a variety of innovative approaches in the domain of preventive diplomacy, such as the work of ombudsmen, long-term missions and the work of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. The OSCE is providing specific expert advice on the drafting and implementation of new constitutions. The Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights is increasing its activities constantly. I believe that the United Nations can benefit greatly from the experience gained in all these aspects of preventive diplomacy.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa31">The OSCE is facilitating the withdrawal of foreign troops and the implementation of bilateral agreements. Progress is being made in arms control, particularly in the implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. This is an important contribution to the efforts of the United Nations in the field of disarmament, and it merits the fullest support of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa32">In short, the recent development of OSCE activities provides new opportunities for cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations. Let us make sure that these opportunities are seized and that our common security is strengthened.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zlenko</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Today, on the eve of the twenty-first century, Europe is going through an important stage in its history. The ending of the cold war has given strong impetus to the process of establishing, between the States of the European continent relations of true partnership in the field of security, as well as new substance to the Helsinki process.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">This has resulted in considerable enhancement of the role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as the most versatile regional structure in Europe for addressing challenges of the twenty-first century. At present, this Organization is tasked with finding solutions to the problems that threaten peace and security in the European region; developing and implementing effective measures in the area of preventive diplomacy; managing critical situations; dealing with arms control and disarmament; and handling post-conflict stabilization. At the same time, the OSCE has not yet accumulated sufficient potential or worked out mechanisms and procedures for the effective settlement of conflicts, particularly in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, around Nagorny Karabakh and in Georgia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">This once again testifies to the fact that the development of a comprehensive system of security in Europe is impossible without the active involvement of the United Nations, which can provide necessary capabilities, resources and experience.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">To this effect, Ukraine supports the development of close cooperation and coordination of arrangements between the United Nations and the OSCE in all areas of mutual interest -- above all, on the prevention and settlement of conflicts and on issues to do with the protection and promotion of basic human rights and freedoms. It is for this reason that we supported the resolution of the General Assembly granting observer status at the United Nations to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-5.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 48/5</a> of 13 October 1993, as well as the resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-13.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/13</a> of 15 November 1994. Our country did so on the basis that the range of problems confronting the European community may be solved more promptly and efficiently through enhanced cooperation and coordination of efforts of the United Nations and OSCE. In our opinion, since the adoption of those resolutions relations between the two organizations have been developing successfully at both the political and the organizational levels. Joint efforts are being made in the area of international humanitarian law and in the monitoring of the observance of human rights. The establishment of a regular political dialogue between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, as well as between their representatives, has become an indicator of a positive relationship.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">In view of the fact that the contemporary world is based on the interconnection of the elements of an integral process for the development of international security, Ukraine views its security within the format of overall OSCE regional security and supports the establishment of a comprehensive system of security for the twenty-first century. In this context, strict observance by Member States of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and other commonly recognized international legal and political instruments is indisputably a permanent requirement. It is only in this way that an end may be put to the relapses of the past and contradictions that still exist, as well as to the proliferation of new threats and challenges to international peace and security on the European continent.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">However, one cannot but be surprised by the attempts of various countries to cast doubt, by their statements and acts, on a number of basic principles of the instruments I have mentioned. This primarily concerns the principles of territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers, non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and refraining from making groundless territorial claims.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">I should like to stress that neglecting these key principles creates a dangerous precedent for security and stability in Europe and the whole world. In our opinion, the United Nations, together with the OSCE, should take preventive measures in order to prevent any attempts whatsoever to rouse separatism, chauvinism, intolerance and aggressive nationalism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">In our view, the emergence of millions of refugees and displaced persons who need to return to their permanent places of residence constitutes one more serious problem in Europe, which is a consequence of wars, armed conflicts, social hatred and scandalous violations of human rights. It is obvious that no single State alone can cope with such problems, which create a permanent hotbed of tension and instability in the region. In this connection, international support from United Nations institutions, as well as assistance by international financial structures and donor countries, will make a weighty contribution to the search for ways to eliminate such problems.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">As is shown by the lessons of the United Nations peace-keeping operations, the United Nations alone cannot perform every function in the peace-making sphere. It should be clear today that all the efforts -- even the enormous efforts -- of the Secretary-General, the Security Council and the General Assembly to prevent conflicts, bring them under control and achieve a final settlement, are futile and ineffective without the cooperation and support of other entities acting in the international arena; here I refer first to regional organizations. We therefore believe that there is still no alternative to coordinated cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations as regards peace-keeping and security.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">This is the basis on which the delegation of Ukraine approaches the issue of active involvement of the OSCE in the resolution of conflicts on the territory of the former USSR, as well as of the former Yugoslavia. We think that mutual diplomatic support on the part of the United Nations and the OSCE is an important prerequisite for the successful resolution of regional problems.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Therefore, we are in favour of a significant expansion of the mutually beneficial consultations between the United Nations and the OSCE in order to exchange opinions on conflict situations in Europe and possible ways to resolve them. We think that timely and rapid provision of technical advisory services by the United Nations could facilitate a gradual political resolution of existing hotbeds of conflict and the elimination of their consequences. In this regard, the delegation of Ukraine supports a proposal to strengthen the process of consultations between the institutions of the United Nations, the OSCE and other organizations; they serve as important forums for exchanging information and coordinating actions, as well as a means to prevent duplication of efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">It is necessary to consider thoroughly a mechanism for conducting joint operations of the United Nations and OSCE -- including humanitarian operations -- which may serve as a possible model of future cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa13">We find it necessary to further the interaction between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. We consider it expedient to explore ways of strengthening contacts between the United Nations and the OSCE with regard to the human dimension.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa14">The agreement between the United Nations Secretary-General and the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE on the framework of cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the OSCE constitutes a solid basis for cooperation in the areas I have mentioned. The Ukrainian delegation believes that we have entered an important stage, in which the arrangements made earlier are to acquire practical effect.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa15">In this connection, the OSCE's participation in the peace-building process in Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a serious test. In our opinion, the OSCE has a special role to play in this process. The formal signing by the parties in conflict of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its annexes on 14 December this year provides real opportunities for reaching comprehensive and long-lasting peace in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa16">I should like to take this opportunity to note that Ukraine highly commends this Agreement, which aims at ending the bloody war, which has lasted for four years, and at promoting a climate of stability and security in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa17">Ukraine proceeds on the assumption that the parties to the conflict bear the main responsibility for the complete and unconditional implementation of all the Agreement's provisions. At the same time, the effective and timely implementation of its provisions, especially as regards its civil component, largely depends on coordination and complementarity of efforts made by the United Nations and the OSCE. The agreement foresees a decisive role for the OSCE in such areas as the preparation and holding of free elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina and monitoring the observance of human rights. It authorizes the OSCE to perform crucial functions in securing regional stability, and confirms the commitment of the OSCE to assist in holding negotiations in order to develop confidence-building measures, including establishing control over armaments.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa18">Together with other organizations and agencies, including the United Nations, the OSCE is called upon to promote a just solution to the problem of refugees, as well as the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the creation of a fully-fledged civil society in this long-suffering State.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa19">In our opinion, carrying out those functions and tasks will be a sort of test of the solidity of cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE, and it should offer an example of complementarity and proportional division of functions between the United Nations and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa20">In this context, I would like to confirm Ukraine's commitment to actively participate in the processes I have mentioned -- in particular, to be a part of the OSCE observation mission, and also to contribute, to the extent possible, to the joint efforts of the international community to achieve the post-conflict reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa21">Finally, I would like to stress once again that future cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE may and should be the most important factor in the successful building and functioning of the comprehensive collective security system both in a new Europe and in the world as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa22">I would also like to state that Ukraine will do its utmost to strengthen and further this cooperation.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fedotov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">The Russian Federation has consistently adhered to the fundamental policy of strengthening and developing interaction between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) -- a regional arrangement as described in Chapter VIII of the Charter. We consider enhancing the effectiveness of cooperation between the two organizations to be an important component in the establishment of a stable, post-confrontational international system.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Russia welcomes the decision of the Budapest Summit of the OSCE Council of Ministers, held on 7 and 8 December this year, on further development of relations between the United Nations and the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">We commend the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-564.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/564</a>), which presents an objective picture of the specific steps to be taken with regard to developing relations between the United Nations and the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Russia fully shares the report's conclusion that further strengthening of the coordination of activities between the United Nations and the OSCE would promote more effective use of the international community's limited resources allocated to carry out the tasks assigned to both organizations. This primarily refers to making optimum use of the functions and machinery for coordination between the United Nations and the OSCE in today's main areas -- preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building, as well as implementing the political and humanitarian aspects of security and development, including human rights, and the rights of national minorities, refugees and displaced persons. It is precisely in these areas that both Organizations have accumulated an inspiring operational capacity, expertise and legal basis that, if rationally combined and divided between them, would make it possible to substantially improve work done in the search for effective responses to international challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Russia favours the establishment of a practical capacity for the OSCE, which would promote the establishment of the Organization as a central institution for ensuring European security and stability. Until recently the activities of the OSCE were mainly focused on the peaceful settlement of disputes, preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping. While supporting these activities, we feel that they should be fully in line with the goals and principles of the Charter and the role of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">At the same time, Russia has always maintained that peace-keeping was not the OSCE's only area of activity in the field of security. On the basis of our initiative, the ministerial Summit of the OSCE held in Budapest approved a decision on the elaboration of a new model of general and comprehensive security for the Europe of the twenty-first century. In keeping with its decisions, other Organizations, including the United Nations, are invited to contribute to the practical work on the model. The expert contribution of the United Nations, whose representatives have already participated in the official seminar of the OSCE on the security model, would be very valuable at a time when preparations are under way for the Lisbon Summit of the OSCE, to be held in 1996, at which an interim summary of the discussions on the model will be presented.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">The nature, form and scope of interaction between the United Nations and the OSCE should respond to the main task of developing comprehensive cooperation between the United Nations and other international organizations, and should be guided primarily by the international legal norms laid down in the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">The Russian delegation notes with satisfaction that the daily interaction between the United Nations and the OSCE in the field of peace-keeping has been developing in a highly productive manner in the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and, in particular, as regards the settlement of conflicts in Abkhazia, the Republic of Georgia and Tajikistan. Russia, together with its CIS partners, will continue to actively support that positive process, because of the importance of actively assisting peace-keeping efforts by the United Nations and the OSCE in the CIS area.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">Russia has actively participated in OSCE efforts to promote a settlement of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. As co-Chairman of the Minsk Conference, we, together with our Finnish co-Chairman and with the support of the other participants in the Minsk Group, have been making every effort to ensure a breakthrough in the negotiations to rapidly conclude a political agreement to end the armed conflict. We note with satisfaction the cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE aimed at bringing about a peaceful settlement of this extremely complex, chronic conflict, and we count on having that process developed further.</p>
</div>

<div class="italicline-tookchair" id="pg010-bk01">
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The President took the Chair.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fedotov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I believe that further implementation of the existing informal agreement on the rational division of labour between the United Nations and OSCE is particularly timely in view of the recent significant progress towards a settlement in the conflict on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Implementing the package of measures included in the Agreement for Peace on Bosnia, as we can already see, will be an ongoing, multi-stage process requiring the productive involvement of many leading multilateral organizations and mechanisms.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">In Russia's opinion, the post-conflict settlement in Bosnia and throughout the former Yugoslavia can become the most important area of cooperation between the United Nations and OSCE, especially in the humanitarian field. We believe that as it develops, a common model can and must be devised to delimit responsibility and establish a kind of division of labour between the United Nations and OSCE in the areas I have mentioned. This would give effect to the Secretary-General's directive, in his report, on</p>
	<blockquote id="pg010-bk02-pa03">"The avoidance of duplicative or overlapping mandates" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-50-564.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/564</a>, para. 13</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">in the two Organizations so that they can be effectively coordinated.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">Russia commends the basic thrust of OSCE participation in the post-conflict reconstruction of the Bosnian region, as agreed upon at the international level, including at the meeting of the OSCE Council of Foreign Ministers in Budapest and at the London Conference, with regard to implementing the peace agreements on Bosnia. We are convinced that the OSCE will be able to make a serious and useful contribution, in particular, to the holding of elections in Bosnia, to helping guarantee human rights and the rights of minorities, and to establishing a normal civil society in Bosnia.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">At the same time, it is our opinion that without the broad experience and expertise of the United Nations, it would be hard for OSCE to carry out its role in post-conflict Yugoslavia. It is possible, and it makes sense, to clearly define in practice the authority of the United Nations and OSCE in this area according to the comparative advantages of each Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">One further consideration, we believe, is that in view of the significant and positive contribution made by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the peace process, it is time to allow that Republic to participate again in both OSCE and a range of United Nations bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">This year important precedents have been set for holding consultations and exchanging information on humanitarian and economic problems using a tripartite format that includes United Nations Programmes and Offices in Geneva, OSCE and the Council of Europe. This practice must be developed further. At the same time, Russia believes that it would be useful to provide for machinery for mandatory contact between countries directly affected by problems being considered.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">Russia intends to continue to promote, and has a vested interest in helping to increase, the effectiveness and practical results of cooperation between the United Nations and OSCE. We are open to any further constructive ideas and proposals in this regard that would supplement what the Secretary-General has said in his report. We hope that the draft resolution before the General Assembly on this subject, of which the Russian Federation is a sponsor, will provide extra momentum to work in this area.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland and Romania associate themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The European Union fully supports <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.62.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.62</a>, now before the General Assembly, of which all the members of the European Union are sponsors. The European Union, through Hungary, as Chairman-in-Office, has actively participated in drawing up the draft resolution with the help of the troika of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The European Union supports greater cooperation between the United Nations and regional arrangements and organizations. In view of the increased challenges and tasks facing the United Nations, this kind of cooperation will benefit both sides and the States involved.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">A clear example of such cooperation that includes an informal division of labour is the relationship between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The report of the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/A-50-564.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/564</a> proves that this cooperation is increasingly effective and fruitful. There is still room for increasing and developing this relationship. One possible way of doing so is pointed out in the document that came out of the recent OSCE Summit in Budapest, in which the participating States agreed that they could, in exceptional circumstances, jointly decide that a dispute should be referred to the Security Council on behalf of OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The activities of OSCE, such as the promotion of confidence-building measures in a military context, fact-finding missions, crisis management and electoral assistance, complement United Nations efforts to maintain and promote international peace and security. In some cases, such as in Tajikistan and the Caucasus, cooperation between the two Organizations is more structured.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">The European Union attaches special importance to the principles and commitments of OSCE. Respect for these principles and commitments, which in some cases set higher standards than those established in United Nations documents, provides the basis of the activities of the Organization. In this sense, the very existence of OSCE enhances prospects for regional action in line with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">OSCE is particularly active in the field of early warning, conflict prevention and crisis management in its area, which stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok. Its comprehensive approach to security, which includes human, economic and military dimensions, allows it to tackle the problems in its area in an effective and enduring way. OSCE combines short- and long-term approaches. The former is necessary to forestall the immediate eruption of a conflict, while the latter impresses upon us that solutions to many problems require sustained effort: there are no quick solutions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">There are various instruments of fundamental importance for preventing conflict in the OSCE area. The Senior Council and the Permanent Council provide a forum for political consultations and ensure coherence and proper orientation in the range of OSCE activities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights also makes a valuable contribution. In the field of election monitoring, the United Nations and the Office are establishing guidelines for close and effective cooperation. Long-term missions in the field, with their various mandates, play an essential role in establishing confidence and a climate for peace at the local level. They are the eyes and ears of OSCE. In addition to continuing the activities of existing missions, OSCE is facing up to the following current challenges: the former Yugoslavia, Nagorny Karabakh and Chechnya.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">With regard to the former Yugoslavia, the European Union welcomes the signing on 14 December 1995 at the Paris Peace Conference of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa11">The European Union has consistently called for a peaceful solution to that painful conflict. We wish to reaffirm our decision to make a substantial contribution to assist all the parties concerned in implementing the provisions of the Agreement for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa12">The European Union will fully support OSCE in carrying out the tasks entrusted to it by the parties to the Dayton Peace Agreement. The European Union will also fully support the OSCE mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the supervision and monitoring of free, fair and democratic elections, as well as in other aspects related to the building of a democratic society based on the rule of law and on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The European Union will make a significant contribution to this work through the European Union monitoring mission.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa13">The European Union likewise supports all other OSCE efforts in this area and wishes to reiterate in particular its support for the principle of establishing a long-term mission in Croatia, whose presence will undoubtedly prove most useful in the promotion of human rights and of the coexistence of the various ethnic communities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa14">As regards Nagorny Karabakh, the technical cooperation and political support that the United Nations is providing for the Minsk process, including the possible establishment of a peace-keeping operation led by OSCE, is a good example of practical cooperation between the two Organizations. The Minsk process remains the sole forum for the settlement of the conflict, and the European Union offers the Finnish and Russian Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference its full support in their efforts to conclude negotiations on a political agreement. We hope that the present commitments to initiate direct contacts, in coordination with the Co-Chairmen, will give fresh impetus to the negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa15">The European Union fully supports the search for a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya. It sees an important role for the OSCE assistance group, which must work under extremely difficult circumstances. In respect of the attainment of this goal, the European Union is concerned over the lack of progress in the negotiating process and the continued suspension of the talks on implementing the military agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa16">In addition, the European Union supports the open debate on a common global security model for Europe in the twenty-first century, which has been designated a major objective of the 1996 Lisbon conference, as well as the Pact on Stability in Europe, which the OSCE is responsible for monitoring.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa17">The European Union appreciates the enhanced contribution of OSCE in promoting respect for human rights in its region. The latest OSCE Conference on the Human Dimension took place in Warsaw last 2 to 19 October. We also wish to highlight the work of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and that of the High Commissioner on National Minorities, which show how successful preventive diplomacy can be in the field of ethnic relations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa18">The European Union also wishes to stress the importance it attaches to dialogue with non-participating countries, especially the Mediterranean Cooperation Partners.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa19">Finally, the European Union wishes to express its appreciation for the valuable work done by the Permanent Representative of Hungary and his delegation in the capacity of Chairman-in-Office of OSCE and to welcome the Ambassador of Switzerland as incoming Chairman-in-Office. The European Union is committed to lending him and his delegation its full cooperation in the year to come.

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jusys</span> <span class="nation">Lithuania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Lithuania has aligned itself with the statement by the European Union and welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Given present-day global concerns, which require rapid-reaction capabilities as well as effective organizational structures, we recognize the need for increased cooperation between the United Nations and OSCE. Coordination through joint or complementary actions in preventive diplomacy, crisis management, arms control and disarmament, as well as post-crisis stabilization and rehabilitation measures will promote the attainment of our goals in the common pursuit of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We request the Secretary-General to continue further discussions in that regard, including those on the division of labour, with the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE. Lithuania notes and welcomes the trilateral consultations begun last year between the United Nations offices and programmes in Geneva, the OSCE and the Council of Europe which have extended beyond information-sharing to responsibility-sharing with the aim of avoiding duplication and of making the best possible use of limited resources.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">As a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, the OSCE provides an important link between European and global security. This link is essential in the light of the ongoing work of the OSCE on a common and comprehensive security model for Europe for the next century, particularly as the work moves into a more operational phase and the working relationship with the United Nations intensifies. We endorse the Ministerial Council decision on this concept, which notes that within the OSCE:</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">"no State, organization or grouping can have any superior responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in the OSCE region, or regard any part of the OSCE region as its sphere of influence".</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The OSCE security concept is a cooperative one based on genuine partnership, free of dividing lines, and on full respect for</p>
	<blockquote id="pg013-bk01-pa06">"the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve." (<a href="../pdf/A-49-800.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/800</a>, annex, Budapest decision VII, "A common and comprehensive security model for Europe for the twenty-first century", first paragraph)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">Thus, transparency in cooperative approaches to security challenges and risks is of great importance to Lithuania, especially with the end of cold war alliances. As regional and trans-Atlantic organizations adapt to a new world order and seek to strengthen confidence, security and stability in the OSCE region, we believe in the value of continued dialogue with neighbouring countries on the key elements of an emerging European security architecture: North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) enlargement and European Union expansion.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">Lithuania is making its contribution to this transparent and democratic process by actively participating in the Baltic round-table of the Pact on Stability in Europe. We support the continuation of this work within the OSCE framework as a valuable tool for addressing regional issues and for implementing the multitude of agreements included in the Pact. Lithuania also supports OSCE plans to keep an informal list of risks and challenges to security updated. This list could also strengthen the United Nations Secretariat's early-warning capacity, especially in identifying situations likely to endanger peace and security in the European continent.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">Lithuania believes it must build upon the regional approach offered by the OSCE in the area of peace-keeping. It welcomes United Nations readiness to provide technical advice and expertise and political support for the possible deployment of multinational peace-keeping forces in the OSCE region following agreement among the parties for a cessation of armed conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">United Nations-OSCE cooperation can also enhance the dramatic and demonstrable progress being made for the first time in decades in arms control and disarmament affairs. Momentum should not be lost on these matters in international and regional forums. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe has had some success in downsizing the major conventional arsenals of Europe, but problems do persist in implementation of the Treaty and more work needs to be done on the flank issues. I should like to stress that this is of particular concern to Lithuania in the light of the high concentration of conventional arms and military personnel at our borders and in the region in general.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">Experience shows that complementary efforts and joint actions between the United Nations and OSCE can be effective. The Helsinki process, which helped set the stage for many of the positive developments and trends in East-West relations in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms, has grown into a comprehensive approach to security, which includes both human and economic dimensions. Far-reaching United Nations and OSCE programmes for economic, social and humanitarian progress are being enhanced within the framework of cooperation as each Organization has provided support to the efforts of the other. It is Lithuania's view that these activities, particularly those that strengthen democratization processes and the development of civil society, should be consolidated. We welcome further coordination between the United Nations Office at Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Economic Commission for Europe and the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, as well as the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">Recognition of the important role the OSCE has to play is evidenced by its involvement in the implementation, pursuant to the Dayton Agreement, of peace-building activities in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in the fields of electoral assistance, human rights monitoring, arms control and confidence-building and security-building measures.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">The OSCE missions and field operations are an important part of the preventive diplomacy network. They provide expert advice in the areas of democracy-building and human rights. We value the OSCE efforts at quiet diplomacy as a means for facilitating democratic change and development in a non-confrontational way.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa14">Lithuania also sees the value of long-term presence where OSCE can play a key mediating role between warring parties to a conflict. In conflict situations, coordinated humanitarian operations are essential. The active participation and consolidated action of relevant United Nations entities, particularly the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, and OSCE institutions will ensure the best possible use of resources made available by Governments to international organizations to carry out their mandates.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa15">We take this opportunity to recognize and acknowledge the outstanding work done by our Hungarian colleagues in their capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE. Lithuania stands ready to cooperate with the incoming Chairman, the Ambassador of Switzerland, during his term in office next year.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Halatchev</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I take the floor with immense satisfaction and an awareness of the significance of this topic for the present and future efforts of the international community to safeguard and promote peace, security and stability. My country associates itself with the statement made by the representative of Spain on behalf of the European Union and associated countries, and is a sponsor of the draft resolution on this item (<a href="../pdf/A-50-L.62.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.62</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The enhanced capacity of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the field of early warning, preventive action and crisis management has opened new opportunities for joint action of the two organizations. The OSCE has gained useful experience in expanding its preventive and peace-making activities in close cooperation and coordination with the United Nations. The experience gained in this process and the ever-increasing need for a more systematic approach to the cooperation of the United Nations with regional organizations has brought about substantial achievements. In this connection we share the opinion that the practice of meetings of the United Nations with regional organizations should be continued in order to provide a valuable opportunity for regular contacts and exchange.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">The ideas and recommendations of the Secretary-General relating to the issues of coordination with regional organizations put forward in his report "Supplement to An Agenda for Peace" are a useful contribution to the ongoing dialogue aimed at the improvement of our capacity to forestall, prevent and manage crises threatening international peace and security. My country continues to be active in this effort, both in the United Nations and in the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">An area that has been gaining special importance in recent times is that of coordination between the two organizations in addressing the key task of post-conflict peace-building in the OSCE's territory, especially with regard to the region of south-eastern Europe. A number of problems resulting from the conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia would best be solved if they became a matter of concern for and common action by the United Nations, the OSCE and other competent international institutions and organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Bulgaria welcomes the signing, on 14 December at the Paris Peace Conference, of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We fully support the important role assigned to the OSCE in implementing the tasks set out in the Dayton Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">One area where the OSCE should play a key role is the achievement of an agreement on arms control in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. It is of the utmost importance to prevent a new arms race in the region, following the lifting of the arms embargo. The OSCE should encourage negotiations with a view to achieving an agreement between the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as an agreement on the desired balance of armaments between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, within the agreed frameworks. The establishment of national limits on armed forces and armaments for the three States is a first step towards broader agreement on regional stability in and around the former Yugoslavia, including limits on the armaments and personnel strengths of all States in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Bulgaria is ready to participate constructively in such negotiations on regional stabilization and to assume rights and obligations stemming from future agreements in this field, on the understanding that existing limitations on armaments, equipment and personnel strength established for Bulgaria by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe will not be renegotiated. Bulgaria is willing to contribute to enhancing transparency and predictability on a regional basis through the development of regional confidence-building and security-building measures going beyond the provisions of the Vienna Document of 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">Bulgaria underlines the primary significance of building and consolidating democracy in the former Yugoslavia. It stands ready to provide experts for the long-term OSCE mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">My country reiterates its keen interest in taking an active part in post-conflict reconstruction in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which is of vital importance to the future economic development of the whole region. We have taken steps to contribute to interregional economic cooperation in the OSCE context of stability and security. We believe that the seminar, which we hosted in Sofia in mid-November, on the role of trans-European infrastructure for security and cooperation in the Black Sea region, developed into a successful pilot project in this regard. We encourage active contributions to the follow-up to the conclusions of that seminar.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chirila</span> <span class="nation">Romania</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is a remarkably dynamic exercise, both in substance and in ways of defining the framework for interaction between the two organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">As the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-564.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/564</a>) says, the OSCE's observer status and the framework agreement concluded in 1993 between the Secretary-General and the Chairman-in-Office of the pan-European organization provide a permanent institutional basis for cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the OSCE. One of the most dynamic factors, both within the OSCE and in the context of interaction between the United Nations and the OSCE, is the European Union. The statement made here by the representative of Spain on behalf of the European Union -- a statement that my delegation fully endorses -- attests to this.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">However, I should like to put forward some more specific ideas of particular interest to my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">For Romania, as well as for other countries of the central European region, hopes for real stability and security depend essentially on the integration of political, security and economic Euro-Atlantic structures -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union and the Western European Union. Developing a strategy with a supple and cohesive approach to the partnership relations between NATO, the European Union, the OSCE and the United Nations -- each with its responsibilities, powers and mode of conduct -- is of vital importance to Euro-Atlantic security and is beneficial to the system of collective security based on the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">As the Secretary-General emphasizes in his report, dialogue between the United Nations and the OSCE to achieve better definition of priorities, spheres of competence and specific lines of action, in order to ensure mutually beneficial effectiveness, is of particular importance. The recent OSCE ministerial meeting in Budapest made new moves in this direction. One notes that there has been progress, particularly in the area of preventive-diplomacy functions, but also that these functions should be exercised more effectively.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">There has not yet been any notable progress as a result of the activities of the OSCE missions in Chechnya, Nagorny Karabakh, the Republic of Moldova and other conflict areas. In Chechnya, for example, agreements are not being respected; in Nagorny Karabakh, we are still practically where we started with regard to the establishment of multilateral peace-keeping forces; and there are still foreign troops stationed in the Republic of Moldova, even though commitments for their withdrawal have been made and reiterated.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">In the context of the economic and humanitarian dimensions of pan-European cooperation, we note dwindling interest on the part of a number of States. There is a tendency to ignore some commitments, such as those regarding freedom of movement, personal contacts and cultural, technical and scientific exchanges. One undoubtedly feels that there is scope for a better distribution and coordination of efforts and responsibilities between the various European institutions with a similar profile.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">The coordination consultations scheduled to take place in Geneva next January may make possible, for example, consideration of explicit options for cooperation between the OSCE and the United Nations, with a view, on one hand, to establishing priority areas and identifying specific problems of each of the organizations and, on the other hand, to developing practical means of cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">The Pact on Stability in Europe, the follow-up to which is provided by the OSCE, is a useful exercise, which, it seems to us, merits retention as an institution of good-neighbourliness, not just for the participants in regional round tables but also for all States parties to the Pact. A pressing need is for this institution of good-neighbourliness and preventive diplomacy to be extended speedily to the area of the former Yugoslavia. In this connection, at the recent OSCE ministerial meeting we suggested that a round table on this subject be organized for that region. The time has come to assess, within the framework of the OSCE, the status of cooperation projects included in the Pact under the generic title "Associated measures". Romania is ready to submit and to consider with other States of the region, in the framework of follow-up to the Pact, its own initiative to ensure historic reconciliation with Hungary.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">The Dayton Agreement, just signed in Paris, opens up real prospects for security and stability in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and for new foundations for cooperation between the States of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa11">Above and beyond the military aspect covered by the multinational force, the ability to shoulder responsibilities and carry out a very important mandate for the success of the future peace process -- supervising the preparation and holding of elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, monitoring the human rights situation, fostering negotiations to establish regional stability and to establish machinery to enhance confidence and security -- is an unprecedented challenge that the OSCE will not be able to face up to without particularly sustained efforts of cooperation and close, effective and timely coordination with the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and all other organizations and institutions involved.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa12">Romania has stated that it is ready to participate in OSCE missions and operations in the area of the former Yugoslavia and to lead one of those missions. My country stands ready to contribute to the establishment of an initial support fund for OSCE activities in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa13">It seems particularly important to us that the group formed within the OSCE to carry out these operations consult all the States directly concerned before taking decisions. It would be useful and necessary for all countries involved to participate in OSCE decision-making regarding the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which would mean readmitting the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the OSCE. Romania has decided to develop more actively its relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, to open a diplomatic mission in Sarajevo and to upgrade the level of its diplomatic representation in Belgrade and other capitals of the region. My country supports the reintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into international organizations and regional and subregional cooperation. We believe that a regional round table -- in the framework provided by the follow-up to the Pact on Stability in Europe -- for the countries in the area of the former Yugoslavia, with the participation of other States of the region, as well as other concerned States, would be a welcome step. We hope that historical reconciliation will become a viable institution in the context of the follow-up to the Pact on Stability in Europe so that good neighbourliness can be consolidated throughout the European continent.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa14">The Dayton Agreement also advocates the preparation of a programme of assistance for economic reconstruction, with international financing. We believe that it would be appropriate for economic reconstruction to be expanded throughout south-eastern Europe, given the consequences of sanctions on the neighbouring countries of the former Yugoslavia. Geographical proximity and economic complementarity recommend Romania as a valid potential partner in the process of economic reconstruction in the area of south-eastern Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa15">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.62.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.62</a>, introduced with great eloquence by Ambassador André Erdös, the representative of Hungary, which has been Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, fully reflects the remarkable dynamics of the OSCE approach to the international scene, as well as of the cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and the OSCE. As a sponsor of the draft resolution, my delegation hopes that it will be adopted by consensus. We also support draft decision <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.63</a>, intended to ensure the continuity of the OSCE mandate <i>vis-à-vis </i>the United Nations under the Swiss chairmanship in 1996.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kouliev</span> <span class="nation">Azerbaijan</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">The delegation of the Azerbaijani Republic welcomes the General Assembly's consideration today of the draft resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). We consider this further proof of the ever increasing contributions of the OSCE to the establishment and maintenance of peace and security throughout the entire OSCE area, from Vancouver to Vladivostok.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Azerbaijan warmly hails the signing four days ago in Paris of the historic General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Annexes thereto by the Presidents of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as the signing of the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium of 12 November 1995, and we strongly believe that the early implementation of these Agreements as a result of, <i>inter alia</i>, cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE, will bring long-awaited peace and stability to all States and peoples of this part of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Azerbaijan highly commends the growing and strengthening interaction between the two Organizations in such crucial fields as preventive diplomacy, settlement of regional conflicts, peace-keeping, humanitarian activities, monitoring of human rights, election monitoring and implementation of sanctions regimes. The report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-564.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/564</a>) of the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, on the implementation of last year's <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-13.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/13</a> is extremely useful in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">I would like also to take note with satisfaction of the concrete efforts undertaken during the past year, as reflected in the report of the Secretary-General, to develop cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE in the settlement of the conflict in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">The Secretary-General was represented at meetings of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group and in September 1995 he dispatched a goodwill mission to the region in support of the OSCE efforts. In addition, the two organizations have been in close contact concerning the technical aspects of a possible OSCE peace-keeping mission in the region of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">I take this opportunity to underline the positive roles played in the course of this year by Hungary as the State holding the chairmanship of the OSCE in 1995, as well as by the Russian Federation and Finland, as the co-Chairmen of the Minsk conference, in the search for ways to a peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. The Personal Representative of the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE, Mr. S. Przygodzki of Poland, should also be commended for his efforts to ensure permanent contact between the parties to the conflict and the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">The Azerbaijani Republic also reiterates its full support for the activities of the OSCE aimed at achieving a peaceful solution to the conflict in and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic and to alleviating remaining tensions between the Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Republic pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-822(1993).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 822 (1993)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-853(1993).pdf" class="pdf">853 (1993)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-874(1993).pdf" class="pdf">874 (1993)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-884(1993).pdf" class="pdf">884 (1993)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">We also support the negotiations under the co-chairmanship of the Minsk Conference to conclude a political agreement on the cessation of the armed conflict in the spirit of the Budapest Summit of 1994 and of the recent OSCE Council of Ministers, and we welcome cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, I would like to state once again that Azerbaijan was, remains and will continue to be committed to the political settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and, in this connection, I would like to refer to the words of the President of the Azerbaijani Republic, Mr. Heydar Aliyev, when he addressed the Special Commemorative Meeting of the General Assembly:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg017-bk01-pa10">"... we condemn all types of aggression in any part of the world. We want peace: peace in the whole world, peace in our region, and peace and good neighbourly relations with all States". <i>(Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,</i> 36th meeting, p. 6)</blockquote>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Celem</span> <span class="nation">Turkey</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">As a participating State of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), we are particularly pleased that the General Assembly is once again considering the important issue of "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe" under agenda item 30.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">In this respect, we thank the Secretary-General for his valuable report on this item and reiterate our firm support for his efforts to foster the institutionalization of cooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">We would also like to express our gratitude to the members of the OSCE troika, namely Hungary, Italy and Switzerland, for their efforts in drafting the resolution which is before us today. We actively participated in the informal consultations on the draft resolution and joined other delegations as sponsors.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">With the advent of the post-cold-war era, new regional approaches for preventing and dealing with conflicts around the world have been set in motion. However, certain developments continue to lead us to a rather pessimistic assessment of the general political climate in the OSCE area. Security and stability are still threatened by continuing and new armed conflicts. Aggression and territorial acquisition by force continue to exist with impunity. We are still far from the restoration of legitimacy and international legality in the entire region of the Caucasus. The conflict in Tajikistan is threatening peace and stability in the region. In the Balkans, time will tell if hope becomes a reality. Despite the recent promising developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina, problems remain to be addressed in Kosovo, the Sandzak and Vojvodina.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">Although significant steps have been taken by the OSCE towards further strengthening its structure and mechanisms, we are still far from dealing adequately with the grave violations of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">The ample creative thinking which has gone into addressing these questions in the last few years has yet to bear fruit regarding the need for a new and clear strategy to deal with ongoing conflicts in an effective and lasting manner.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">The challenges we face today are far beyond the means and resources of the United Nations, which cannot alone respond effectively and adequately to the ever-growing urgency of maintaining peace and security around the globe. Accordingly, we firmly believe that there is an imminent need for a collective security architecture of mutually reinforcing institutions in which all elements will have a role to play. In this respect, the OSCE is playing a fundamental role in the maintenance of peace and security as well as fostering democracy and respect for human rights in its vast area of responsibility extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">We believe there is a great potential for further strengthened cooperation between our two organizations within the framework of the Charter and of the fundamental documents of the OSCE. We would like to emphasize in particular the 1992 Helsinki Document, the Decisions of the Budapest Summit of 1994, as well as the Decisions of the most recent Budapest Ministerial Council of 1995, where, among other things, principles and procedures for OSCE peace-keeping activities were established and reaffirmed.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">We regard the decisions on potential OSCE peace-keeping activities in its area of responsibility as a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, we believe that, as participating States, we have not yet been able firmly to demonstrate our political will to implement many of our decisions to this effect. Our efforts have largely remained limited to small-scale activities in the area of preventive diplomacy.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">However, I must reiterate our particular satisfaction with the encouraging developments in the area of OSCE peace-keeping. A case in point is the conflict in and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic and the tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan. As is well known, the OSCE Minsk Group has been striving to achieve a solution to this problem for the past three years. As a member of this group from its inception, we have actively participated in its efforts. We fully support the Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE and the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference in their efforts. We continue to believe that the OSCE, in general, and the Minsk Group, in particular, continue to be the appropriate mechanisms through which an acceptable and just solution can be found and that all efforts within the OSCE should be directed towards supporting those of the Minsk Group. In this regard, we welcome the particular reference in the draft resolution before us to last year's <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-13.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 49/13</a>, where the activities of the OSCE in this area were fully supported by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">In this respect, we welcome the most recent decision adopted at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Budapest held on 7 and 8 December 1995, by which the earlier decision of the Budapest Summit of 1994 to establish an OSCE peace-keeping force to be deployed in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic was reaffirmed.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">We believe we are on the threshold of a major development with regard to the role to be played by OSCE as a regional organization acting within the framework of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. By setting a precedent in the peace-keeping activities of OSCE, the deployment of an OSCE peace-keeping force to the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan will, in our view, be a crucial test for the participating States to reaffirm their will to give new impetus to their common endeavour, which is to pursue peace and legitimacy in the area of responsibility of OSCE, as stipulated in the relevant documents of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa13">We welcome the reference made in the draft resolution to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, signed in Paris on 14 December 1995, and the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, signed on 12 November 1995. In this respect, we highly value OSCE norms and principles as important building blocks to establish and further develop democracy and respect for</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa15">However, we regret that calls by the international community, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-855(1993).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 855 (1993)</a>, for the return of OSCE missions to Kosovo and the Sandzak and Vojvodina regions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) at the earliest possible time remained unanswered by the Serbian authorities. Consequently, we welcome the fact that the draft resolution before us reiterates the significant contribution that OSCE missions have made to the maintenance of stability in Kosovo, the Sandzak and Vojvodina. We consider the reference made in the draft resolution before us to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-855(1993).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 855 (1993)</a> as renewed testimony by United Nations Member States of their support for the continuation of OSCE missions in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa16">In conclusion, let me reiterate our firm belief that the activities of the United Nations and those of the OSCE are mutually reinforcing and complementary in nature. To this effect, we reckon that the United Nations continues to play the central role in the maintenance of peace and security around the world. Thus, the scope of cooperation between the two Organizations should, in our view, entail a division of labour which could culminate in a new form of collective security architecture in the future. In this respect, we attach particular importance to the ongoing efforts within the Organization to elaborate a common and comprehensive security model for the Europe of the twenty-first century and, to this effect, welcome the reference contained in the draft resolution.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk05-pa01">Before calling on the next speaker, I would like to seek the cooperation of delegations on the matter of punctuality.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk05-pa02">As we are entering the last week of this part of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly, the Assembly will have to take many decisions. As Members are aware, for any decision to be taken by the Assembly, a quorum is required. This morning, for lack of a quorum and owing to the absence of scheduled speakers, the plenary meeting of the Assembly started only at 10.35 a.m.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk05-pa03">I would therefore like to remind delegations that punctuality is of the utmost importance in order to ensure an effective and orderly organization of the work of the Assembly and to achieve economies for the United Nations. I strongly endorse the practical suggestions that were made at previous sessions for each delegation to designate someone to be present at the scheduled time. I genuinely hope that all delegations will cooperate.</p>
