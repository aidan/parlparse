	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">I am pleased to introduce the following reports of the Third Committee on the items assigned to the Committee by the General Assembly for consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Under agenda item 102, entitled "Social development, including questions relating to the world social situation and to youth, ageing, disabled persons and the family", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 25 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-634.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/634</a>, the adoption of five draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">Under agenda item 103, entitled "Crime prevention and criminal justice", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 22 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-635.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/635</a>, the adoption of seven draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Under agenda item 104, entitled "International drug control", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-636.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/636</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">Under agenda item 105, entitled "Advancement of women", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 32 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-637.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/637</a>, the adoption of seven draft resolutions, and, in paragraph 33, the adoption of one draft decision. I should like to state that draft resolutions II and III were considered under both item 105 and item 106, entitled "Implementation of the outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">Under agenda item 106, entitled "Implementation of the outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 10 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-638.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/638</a>, that one draft resolution be adopted. I should like to point out to the General Assembly that in operative paragraph 47 of the draft resolution entitled "Follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action", in the English text only, after the words "fifty-second session", delete the word "or".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">Under agenda item 107, entitled "Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, questions relating to refugees, returnees and displaced persons and humanitarian questions", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 24 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-639.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/639</a>, the adoption of five draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa08">Under agenda item 108, entitled "Promotion and protection of the rights of children", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 16 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-640.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/640</a>, the adoption of two draft resolutions and, in paragraph 17, the adoption of one draft decision.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa09">Under agenda item 109, entitled "Programme of activities of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-641.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/641</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa10">Under agenda item 110, entitled "Elimination of racism and racial discrimination", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 22 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-642.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/642</a>, the adoption of three draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa11">Under agenda item 111, entitled "Right of peoples to self-determination", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 22 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-643.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/643</a>, the adoption of three draft resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa12">Under agenda item 112 (a), entitled "Human rights questions: implementation of human rights instruments", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 23 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.1</a>, the adoption of four draft resolutions and, in paragraph 24, the adoption of one draft decision. I should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the fact that in draft resolution III, "Fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", operative paragraph 2, the words "for all" should be added at the end. Also, at the end of operative paragraph 10, add the words "including the adoption of the Declaration on the Right to Development".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa13">Turning to agenda item 112 (b), entitled "Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 62 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.2</a>, the adoption of 18 draft resolutions and, in paragraph 63, the adoption of one draft decision.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa14">On agenda item 112 (c), entitled "Human rights questions: human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 44 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.3</a>, the adoption of 11 draft resolutions and, in paragraph 45, the adoption of one draft decision. I wish to note that in paragraph 4 of draft resolution X, "Situation of human rights in Rwanda", the words "Special Representative of Rwanda" should be replaced by the words "Special Representative for Rwanda".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa15">On agenda item 112 (d), entitled "Human rights questions: comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 11 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.4.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.4</a>, the adoption of one draft resolution and, in paragraph 12, the adoption of one draft decision. I wish to note that in paragraph 5 of the report the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should be added to the list of sponsors of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/AC.3-52-L.64.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.3/52/L.64</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa16">With respect to agenda item 112 (e), entitled "Human rights questions: report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights", the Third Committee reports in <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.5.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.5</a> that no proposals were submitted under this item.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa17">On agenda item 12, entitled "Report of the Economic and Social Council", the Third Committee recommends, in paragraph 9 of <a href="../pdf/A-52-633.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/633</a>, the adoption of two draft decisions. I wish to note that the title of draft decision I was omitted from the report. It should read "Organization of work of the Third Committee and biennial programme of work of the Committee for 1998-1999".</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, <i>i.e</i>., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Third Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified otherwise in advance. This means that where recorded votes and a separate vote were taken in the Committee, the Assembly will do the same.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">I also hope that we shall be able to proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Third Committee.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">We wish to explain our vote on the draft resolution entitled "Improvement of the situation of women in rural areas", contained in the report of the Third Committee to the General Assembly (<a href="../pdf/A-52-637.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/637</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The Sudan has been a sponsor of draft resolutions on this subject for a long time. The Sudanese Government decided to sponsor such resolutions in the past because of the realization that rural women are very vulnerable, and there is a real need to improve their situation, particularly in developing countries, including in the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Unfortunately, this year it was difficult for our delegation to even join the consensus on this draft, because of the controversial language introduced into the text. This has changed last year's agreed language that was acceptable to all delegations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">The reason why Sudan joined the consensus in the end was that most paragraphs of the draft resolution aim at improving the situation of rural women so that they may become effective participants in society. Moreover, the draft urges States and the international community to take the necessary measures to empower rural women, to respond to their needs and to pull them up from the economic conditions in which many live, particularly in the developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">In spite of these noble aims, which we fully support, the Sudan is obliged to express its reservation on operative paragraph 2 (e). The reasons for this position are follows: first, the paragraph attempts to distort the agreed language of international conferences, particularly the language of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which were negotiated in depth. Moreover, the new language introduced into the paragraph results in unacceptable ambiguity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">Secondly, the deviation which took place in this paragraph, particularly the reference to inheritance, can be interpreted as contradicting Islamic law, the shariah.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Thirdly, the Sudan's confirmed position is to strongly reject any language that contradicts Islamic law. We do not consider ourselves parties to such language; nor can it be binding on us. Such language cannot be considered agreed language. Therefore, it cannot be used in the future as such.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Women's inheritance was a controversial issue during previous international conferences and during many negotiations on various international instruments. The bottom line for consensus was quite clear. It was evident that divergent approaches and viewpoints existed and that there were specific points on which no consensus could ever be reached. Therefore, attempts to force a consensus are completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">As for the position of Islamic law concerning the inheritance of women, we would like to clarify the following points: first, Islam grants all women the equal right to inherit; secondly, the division of inheritance in Islam is not based on gender; and thirdly, according to Islamic law inheritance is distributed to the relatives on the basis of the degree of relationship to the deceased -- for example, the mother of a deceased person would inherit one-eighth of the assets: money, land, et cetera. And a mother is a woman. This could be more than the share of a number of males in the family, including sons of the deceased.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">The United Nations has continued to call for respect for the principle of tolerance between religions, countries and peoples. Therefore, we question today the reasons which make some compel us, as Muslims, to justify our beliefs and religion, or for others to look down on a sacred religion by calling it a "philosophy". This attitude motivates us to renew once more our call for respect for the beliefs of others and for the recognition of the diversities which really exist in the world.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kasanda</span> <span class="nation">Zambia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">At the time that the Third Committee took action on the resolution entitled "Improvement of the situation of women in rural areas", my delegation reserved its right to make a general statement in explanation of position.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Zambia became a sponsor of this resolution because we attach great importance to the situation of rural women. In Zambia, 60 per cent of our population live in rural areas, and the majority are women. In Africa, women constitute the majority of the population and are, in fact, one of the continent's greatest assets, in that they are responsible for 60 to 80 per cent of food production. Food is produced predominantly by rural women.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">Zambia had the privilege of making a statement in the Third Committee on behalf of the members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in which we elaborated on the vital importance of the right of ownership of land for rural women. We pointed out that land tenure practices usually ensure male control of activities and the allocation of the best land and agricultural input for export crops. We further pointed out that inheritance practices, whereby land traditionally passes from father to son -- thus denying women their right to inheritance, let alone their right to equal inheritance -- further reinforce male control and exacerbate the poverty of women.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">In addressing the issue of the feminization of poverty, one of the key issues that has been identified is that of land ownership. A definite link has been made between poverty and the absence of land ownership. It is a proven fact that land ownership facilitates access to a range of benefits and opportunities, and the disproportionate enjoyment by men of rights to land excludes women from those benefits and opportunities. Without title to land, women's access to agricultural support services, particularly credit and extension services, where land ownership is expected as collateral or as a precondition, is drastically limited.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The majority of land in Africa is agricultural land subject to traditional inheritance practices, and therefore the right to equal inheritance of land by women becomes vitally important. It lies at the very heart of women's economic empowerment, especially for rural women who may not be able to purchase title to land. The issue is also a question of development. Any meaningful development is not possible when more than half of a population are denied the right to own land, which is a major productive resource.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">It is also a question of human rights. Everyone is born equal and has the right to be treated equally. The issue of land rights discrimination is a matter of human rights. Women are being discriminated against by virtue of their being born as women.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">For these reasons the delegation of Zambia will, in all appropriate forums, continue to advocate the enactment of laws that will guarantee women the right to equal inheritance. In this light, we wish to express our gratitude to the delegation of Mongolia for its excellent work and patience in striving to achieve consensus on this draft resolution. We also wish to express our gratitude to all those delegations which worked so hard to maintain the delicate consensus reached in the Commission on the Status of Women on the inheritance language. We regret that a few delegations, which were clearly a minority, chose not to respect and maintain that agreement. We shall, however, remain unrelenting in our pursuit of justice on this very important issue.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">My delegation will join consensus on draft resolution I, entitled "Improvement of the situation of women in rural areas". But we would like to put on record our reservations with regard to operative paragraph 2 (<i>e</i>) because it contradicts our Islamic shariah. Islam has guaranteed women their full rights, including the right to inheritance. The Holy Quran provides that the male will have twice as much as the female. Therefore with regard to the issue of inheritance in Islam, there is a definite rule from which we cannot turn aside and which cannot be questioned.</p>

However, we would also like to make clear that the issue of inheritance in Islam is complex. In Islam, inheritance distribution between the sexes is governed by relationship and kinship. My delegation would like to put on record our reservations about the wording of paragraph 2 (<i>e</i>) of the draft resolution.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa01">Fiji believes that observation of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People should not be an exercise just to admit that indigenous people still exist in our world. Observation of the Decade should therefore be meaningful and fruitful to the future of indigenous people. It should address the bleak future they now face, through the establishment of an international fund for their survival, development, progress and enhanced future. We must move at a greater speed to adopt the draft United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. We must set up as quickly as possible an indigenous-people unit in our Organization. Our ultimate goal should be the adoption of an international convention on the world's indigenous people.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa02">We are also concerned over the lack of progress on the adoption of the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. An international declaration on such rights is, in our view, an international testimony and commitment to our care, concern and profound interest in the future of our indigenous people. Yet after three meetings, only two of the 45 articles have been adopted. The two adopted are almost negligible with regard to the substantive aspects of indigenous rights, such as self-determination, ownership and control of resources and affirmative-action programmes to promote their development and progress. If observation of the Decade is to be meaningful, the international community, and Member States in particular, should display the political will to finalize the draft declaration as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa03">We are most concerned over the information on the world's indigenous people on page 43 of the 1997 <i>Human Development Report</i>. According to the report, indigenous people have seen their values and customs destroyed by the incoming population and have frequently turned to alcoholism or suicide. In developing countries, they mix to some extent with the majority population, but in the industrial countries, many have ended up on reservations, facing a bleak future. The report went on to state that in almost all societies where they are to be found, indigenous peoples are poorer than most other groups, fare worse in the non-income dimensions of poverty and face discrimination when it comes to employment. The report is a very sad commentary on the fate of the world's indigenous people at a time when we are observing an International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. The question my delegation wishes to ask is, what are we really observing? The bleak future of the world's indigenous people, their victimization and repression in our world, a trend in their treatment which could spell their extinction?</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa04">Surely, our observations should be more meaningful and helpful and contribute to the creation of a better future for indigenous people during the decade.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa05">We therefore continue to call for the drafting, negotiation and adoption of an international convention on the world's indigenous people to create a legal framework for their survival, development, progress and future in our world. The indigenous people consider the adoption of the current draft critical to their survival. This was the message that came out clearly from the many representatives of indigenous peoples throughout the world who attended a regional seminar hosted by my Government last year as part of its programme of activities for observance of the Decade of the World's Indigenous People.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa06">We believe that a positive aspect of international observance should be the setting up of a unit for indigenous peoples' affairs in the United Nations, a proposal which my delegation has been espousing consistently over the past few years. In our view, our observance of the Decade would be even more significant and meaningful if such a unit were established.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa07">Finally, my delegation would like to see these matters reflected in the draft resolution on the Decade at our fifty-third session.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa08">In the meantime, Fiji will join the consensus on the draft resolution before us since we still consider it a step in the right direction.</p>

	<p id="pg018-bk10-pa01">My delegation has asked to speak in explanation of vote on draft resolution XV, entitled "Human rights and terrorism".</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk10-pa02">At the outset, I wish to stress that Lebanon vigorously condemns all acts of terrorism and believes that terrorism is one of the most terrible scourges of democratic societies. My delegation reiterates its commitment to cooperating fully in the context of any just, equitable and impartial international effort to combat terrorism. In fact, Lebanon has already ratified most of the international conventions against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk10-pa03">My delegation abstained in the voting on this resolution for the following reasons. First, the resolution does not condemn state terrorism that allows for the occupation of foreign territories, such as the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the horrible massacres of our fellow citizens by the Israeli army. We, like many other States, are convinced that foreign occupation is one of the most awful forms of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk10-pa04">Secondly, the resolution makes no reference to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-51.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 46/51</a> of 9 December 1991, referred to by the Commission on Human Rights in other resolutions adopted subsequently to emphasize the need to establish a clear definition of the concept of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk10-pa05">Thirdly, the resolution does not draw a distinction between the right to combat foreign occupation and the just and legitimate struggle of peoples to liberate their territories. The latter is a right enshrined in international law, including the United Nations Charter and the Declaration on Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk06-pa02">In accordance with Bhutan's position on country-specific resolutions pertaining to human rights, our delegation will abstain in the voting on the draft resolution. We would, however, like to place on record our reservation on operative paragraph 4 (g) of the text, which addresses the issue of capital punishment. A number of delegations had approached the sponsors with an amendment to delete the words "for apostasy or non-violent crimes" from that paragraph, which we regret, was not accepted.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk06-pa03">The deletion would have avoided an intrusive qualification on which crimes may and may not be penalized by capital punishment. We would remind the Committee that no international consensus exists on the abolition of capital punishment. We also point out that article 6 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allows capital punishment for the most serious crimes. Unlike operative paragraph 4 (g), the Covenant does not attempt to specify which crimes capital punishment may or may not be applied to.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rahmtalla</span> <span class="nation">Sudan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">The delegation of the Sudan would like to make a general statement before the voting on the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, draft resolution IV in the report of the Third Committee contained in <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.3</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">The Government of the Sudan takes a continued interest in human rights; this is a genuine principle of our Government, which has placed the issue of achieving peace and the system of governance in the country at the forefront of its priorities. Proof of that is what has been achieved in the field of human rights since the beginning of this year alone, which we would like to summarize as follows.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">First, the Peace Agreement between the Government and all the rebel factions except one was signed on 21 April 1997. That Agreement, known as the Khartoum Agreement, included the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This has been attested to by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights appointed by the General Assembly to study the situation of human rights in the Sudan. Here, I would like to cite some excerpts by way of example. The Agreement stated:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa04">"1. The Sudan is a multiracial, multi-ethnic, multicultural and multireligious society. Islam is the religion of the majority of the population and Christianity and the African creeds are followed by a considerable number of citizens. Nevertheless the basis of rights and duties in the Sudan shall be citizenship, and all Sudanese shall equally share in all aspects of life and political responsibilities on the basis of citizenship.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa05">"2. Freedom of religion, belief and worship shall be guaranteed.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa06">"3. A suitable atmosphere shall be maintained for practising, worship, <i>dawa</i>, proselytization and preaching. "4. No citizen shall be coerced to embrace any faith or religion.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa07">"5. There shall be no legislation that would adversely affect the religious rights of any citizen.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa08">"6. a. Shariah and custom shall be sources of legislation".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">In separate provisions, the Khartoum Agreement states:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa10">"The Supreme Court is the custodian of the Constitution and is thus entrusted with the protection and interpretation of the Constitution.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa11">"The people of south Sudan shall exercise the right to self-determination through a referendum.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa12">"The Constitution shall enshrine the following principles: a. There shall be no punishment except as provided for by the law; and b. Every person is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa13">"The bill of rights and freedoms shall be enshrined in the Constitution.</blockquote>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk01-pa14">"All personal matters such as marriage, divorce, parentage and inheritance shall be governed by the religion and custom of those involved."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa15">Second, following the signing of the Agreement, the Government tried to negotiate with the only rebel faction outside the peace process. It agreed to adopt the Declaration of Principles of the Extraordinary Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) as a basis for discussion and negotiations. The Sudanese Government participated at the highest levels in the latest talks held under the aegis of IGAD last October, in which it was agreed to resume negotiations next April.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa16">Third, in the field of relief to those affected by war in the country, Sudan's cooperation continued with the process which it initiated in the first place -- Operation Lifeline Sudan. Last week, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs for the Sudan, Mr. van Schaik, visited our country and conducted highly positive negotiations with the Government. In line with these negotiations, new outlets for food distribution to new regions in the country were allowed, including the areas under the control of the sole rebel faction. It is worth mentioning here that some of those who co-sponsored the draft resolution described the results of the visit of the Special Envoy as extremely positive. On our side, we emphasize what they have stated in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa17">Fourth, the country's independent National Commission for the Preparation of the Permanent Constitution continues its work, with the involvement of all sectors of the Sudanese people. It is expected that it will complete the draft constitution at the beginning of 1998.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa18">Fifth, the Government renewed once more, through its President, the offer of amnesty to all those who bore weapons against the homeland. It also reiterated its invitation for political participation internally by all parties, without any restrictions or exclusions. A great number of politicians and citizens accepted this invitation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa19">Sixth, the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Gáspár Bíró, was received twice, first in January and then in September 1997. Complete cooperation was accorded him at all levels, official and unofficial, as he stated in his interim report [<a href="../pdf/A-52-510.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/510</a>, annex] to this session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa20">Seventh, many constitutional decrees were issued in July 1997 providing the framework for human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the Khartoum Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa21">Eighth, the Consultative Council for Human Rights, a body comprising various formal and informal circles interested in human rights, has set up a number of fact-finding commissions to verify allegations of human rights violations. A number of these committees have completed their work, and the Special Rapporteur made comments about the results. Efforts still continue in cooperation with him to foster and protect human rights in the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa22">Through these comments we intended to provide only some examples of the persistent efforts being made by my country's Government to foster and maintain human rights. However, instead of these accomplishments meeting with recognition and appreciation, we regrettably find that the American delegation and the co-sponsors of the draft resolution insist on submitting a draft resolution which could, at a minimum, be described as devoid of honesty and credibility. It clearly reflects the degree of politicization to which some States have gone in dealing with this noble issue relating to the promotion and preservation of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa23">When we refer to the politicization of human rights, the finger of blame is always pointed at us and we are characterized as attempting to run away from upholding the principles of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa24">However, the targeting of the present Government by the United States does not require any proof. The American declarations on the need to get rid of the current Sudanese Government by any and all means, including military ones -- let me reiterate: by any and all means, including military ones -- fill all mass media. The visits paid by American officials to the region and to what is described by the United States as "front-line States" is a fact, not a Sudanese allegation. We even find the United States attempting to set the Sudan against its neighbours, with whom the Sudan will continue to foster its relations.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa25">It is clear that all these policies, which have been declared at the highest levels, aim at prolonging the duration of the conflict in the southern part of the Sudan and undermining the efforts of the Sudan Government to establish peace. If we add to this the unilateral imposition of economic sanctions against the Sudan, we find that all these policies cannot be construed in a non-political context. The other proof of that is the statement of the spokesman of the United States State Department that the objective of the unilateral economic sanctions against the Sudan is to exercise political pressure on the elected Sudanese Government and to coerce it into changing its behaviour and seriously to involve itself in the peace talks held in Nairobi. That matter has led to hampering these talks, delaying them until the beginning of next year.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa26">All of these policies emphasize to the States Members of the United Nations the real motives behind the submission of this draft resolution on the human rights situation in the Sudan. These practices constitute a gross violation of internationally binding resolutions in the area of human rights. The Assembly has very recently stated that the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions represents a violation of the economic and humanitarian rights of peoples and adversely affects economic and social development, the right of the individual to live in dignity, and a contravention of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa27">The insistence of the sponsors in submitting this kind of draft resolutions and the addition of new and negative elements annually are in line with the ongoing campaigns against the orientation of the Sudanese people and its Government. Such campaigns are targeting the tolerant Islamic faith. Otherwise, how can we interpret the addition of a new element to this year's draft resolution which deals with the sexual abuse of children? It is an accusation which would make any Muslim feel ashamed. Some might deny what we are saying, but these attacks are levelled at Islam and at more than 1 billion Muslim believers in the United Nations sanctuary during the celebration of a great occasion -- United Nations Human Rights Day -- on the pretext of protecting the rights of women. This stands as proof that Islam is the primary target. We cannot accept that some would exploit the rostrum of this international Organization to derogate from an incontrovertible right -- the right to faith.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa28">We also denounce any attempts to belittle divine faiths or to subject them to human whims and secular purposes. We strongly denounce any deprecation of Islam or any attempt to distort it or to link it to allegations of violations of human rights, the rights of children and the rights of women or with terrorism. We see in such behaviour a new and enormous challenge facing the international community which should strive to put a stop to this kind of confrontational attitude among various creeds and faiths in this world.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa29">I should like to conclude my statement by saying that the Government of the Sudan will continue its drive towards peace. The insistence of some on ignoring the positive references in the report of the Special Rapporteur to the peace agreement signed in Khartoum on 21 April 1997 and other positive developments by way of fostering human rights in the Sudan will not dissuade the Government from such pursuit. It will not be impeded by the intransigence and inequity manifested by the group of sponsors. The Sudan will continue on its road to achieving peace and good-neighbourliness.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa30">For these reasons, my delegation rejects this draft resolution and calls for a vote thereon. We request that most members of the Assembly reject it. We take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Group of 77 and China to the stand they took, as described on the same day last year by the representative of Costa Rica, to the effect that the Group will ask for a vote on any draft resolution containing the phrase "within existing resources", and that the Group will vote against that phrase, which is mentioned in paragraphs 8 and 21 of the present draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa31">It is a source of irony that the European Union and most of its members which are sponsors of this draft resolution rejected that phrase last year. But when the matter is coupled with political objectives, logic vanishes, the human conscience goes to sleep, and the principled stands taken by those European States, which sponsored this draft resolution in spite of the existence of this phrase therein, are put on hold.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa32">Is this not contradiction in its most glaring manifestations?</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa01">My delegation would like to seize this opportunity also to extend its gratitude to all those States that did not support this draft resolution when it was put to the vote in the Third Committee on November 1997. We again call upon the States to uphold justice, not only for the purpose of supporting Sudan, but also for the glorification of the principles of human rights which all of us espouse and for shielding them from political exploitation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa01">To affirm that gross, systematic and mass human rights violations are taking place in Cuba is vulgar slander. Lauding a ridiculous Special Rapporteur cannot conceal the fact that he is but a pitiful pawn. Though some may feign ignorance, everyone knows that this exercise is a gross political manipulation by the United States against Cuba.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa02">In the last few weeks, the United States submitted a draft resolution endorsing a report that no one knew about and later offered up its sterile resolution as a tribute to Miami's annexationist mafia.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa03">The United States' economic war on Cuba constitutes the only mass, gross and systematic violation of the rights of the Cuban people. This is an irrefutable truth.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa04">We are being accused by the United States, the country that is trying to subjugate a whole people through hunger and disease; the organizer, for almost half a century, of the most unprecedented plans of aggression, and from whose territory, in recent months, terrorist acts against Cuba have been carried out with impunity.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa05">This is also the country of racism and inequality, where the family income of blacks is half that of whites; where infant mortality in the black population is twice that of whites; where the incarceration rate of blacks is six times that of whites; and where the leading cause of death among black youths is homicide, whereas white youths mainly die driving luxurious cars while drunk. There are more young blacks in prison than in college and, at the current rate, an absolute majority of young blacks will in a few years be in prisons or reform schools.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa06">The United States is the country where immigrants are hated, exploited -- even literally enslaved -- or murdered in a "low-intensity war" on the southern border. It is home to the biggest and most repressive prison system, and it is where one out of every six people executed is innocent. It is where well-known cases of police brutality are on the rise; where there is an increasing number of reported cases of torture of detainees and inmates; and where Puerto Rican political prisoners serve long prison terms, suffer abuse and lack medical care.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa07">In the United States the homeless are growing in number; there are 40 million people with no medical insurance, more than half of them children; domestic violence is on the rise, even against children, who have the highest suicide rate in the developed world. The United States people are of the opinion that they are living in a sick and misguided country, where hopelessness is growing as the economy grows.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa08">We have been told that this draft resolution enjoys broad, even universal sponsorship. That is false. In fact there is one author and a small group of junior partners, some of them original and some what I might call "restored". Two thirds of States Members will not be voting in favour of this infamy. These are the same old sponsors, who share a colonial mentality by which they would put dozens of countries of the South into the dock without recognizing their own inequality, injustice, racism and xenophobia, their violations of the human rights of immigrants and minorities, their unjust and selective deportation policies, the impunity with which the trade in human, even children's, organs operates, and their tolerance of child and "exotic" prostitution.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa09">Also curious is the voting pattern followed by today's sponsors in the draft resolutions adopted by the Third Committee, when they are not devoted to reproving countries of the South. Almost without exception, this afternoon's sponsors voted against draft resolutions dealing with respect for sovereignty and non-interference in electoral processes and against condemnation of unilateral coercive measures that violate human rights. They also voted against or abstained on draft resolutions on the non-use of mercenaries, and on the right to development -- in the latter case protesting a paragraph that promoted the inclusion of the Declaration on the Right to Development in the International Bill of Human Rights. Almost unanimously they also abstained on draft resolutions dealing with freedom of travel and family reunification, with objectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity in the field of human rights, and with terrorism and its connection with human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa10">Moreover, the countries of the European Union, whose differences in the human rights area could be addressed through cooperation and dialogue, are being forced to perform acrobatics in a one-way stream, and they rush to give pleasing explanations every time they defend, even timidly, their own sovereignty from the extraterritorial laws imposed on them by the Empire.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa11">There are also chronic sponsors. One of them is responsible for the most serious violations of human rights in the Middle East. The United States has applied extraterritorial sanctions against it based on the Helms-Burton Act, just two weeks after it had supported with its vote the United States embargo on Cuba.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa12">Another is a far-off republic where converted apparatchiks, in order to disguise their lack of industriousness in restoring their democracy, have sold the United States their uranium and their souls, in the hope that their corruption and despotism will be forgiven.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa13">After exerting so much pressure on so many countries of the South, the delegation of the United States can be proud of having achieved the "dramatic" inclusion in this anti-Cuban exercise of precisely those who in the past had offered their territory for the Bay of Pigs invasion and who now rent their seat and their adjective-crammed speeches to the Miami mafia; of the accomplices in the dirty war against their own country; and of those who now betray their own people by restoring the privileges of criminals in one of this century's most brutal dictatorships.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa14">Cuba takes pride in its democracy; like all democracies it is imperfect, but Cuba has found its own formulas to ensure for every Cuban without exception direct and full participation in the country's decisions. Cuba takes pride in having, and periodically electing, "a Government of the people, by the people and for the people".</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa15">What is actually being called into question today is the constitutional order which the Cuban people gave themselves in a referendum. The purpose is to show that the Cuban revolution is incompatible with so-called democratic values, with individual liberties and with political rights.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa16">Cuba is proud of its socialist revolution, and the overwhelming majority of Cubans are ready to defend it with their blood. Cuba exists under the circumstances of an undeclared war waged from near its shores. The so-called dissident movement, purporting to be a legitimate opposition, is a fifth column made up of a mere handful of annexationists organized and financed by the United States. They are not political dissidents; they are vulgar mercenaries.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk05-pa17">Cuba reiterates its willingness to cooperate and to engage in dialogue in this field. But it is also prepared for confrontation. Cuba enjoys full sovereignty; it is independent in its own right, and it owes an explanation only to its own people on how it votes at the United Nations. In defence of its sovereignty, its democracy and its people's human rights, Cuba will vote against this travesty.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Mohamed</span> <span class="nation">Yemen</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">Yemen has always taken a firm and well-defined position on draft resolutions transmitted by the Third Committee to the General Assembly on the human rights situation in specific States, and we shall continue to do so. Our decision not to participate in the voting on these draft resolutions is based on a strong conviction and clear understanding of all the complex factors that affect human rights, that violate fundamental freedoms, and that deprive human beings of the ability to enjoy their dignity, wherever they may be.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa02">In principle, in its policies and in its civilization, Yemen attaches high priority in its decision-making and its practices to human rights at the local, regional and international levels. It seeks constantly to establish the appropriate political and economic environment and to create social conditions in which the theoretical and practical concepts of human rights can be translated into reality.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa03">The development and democratic process proceeding progressively in Yemen is in total consonance with international conventions, criteria and instruments. Successful attempts by my country to hold free and direct parliamentary elections, the participation of all sectors in them, the success of women in gaining parliamentary seats, and the other positive steps being taken at present to establish a free democratic and economic order all attest to our serious approach towards realizing human rights, so that all Yemeni citizens may exercise their rights and be enabled to actually enjoy their freedoms, and their freely chosen options in their society. Yemen is also constantly striving to broaden the network of education and training and granting the press and information media, in general, large freedom of expression and participation. Today, in Yemen, there are more than 100 newspapers and independent party publications. Moreover, there are more than 17 political parties and organizations. All these efforts are aimed ultimately at raising awareness, expanding education and bolstering economic and political security and stability, as well as effecting the basic and necessary changes that would enable the citizens of Yemen to breathe freely in an environment of freedom and dignity and thereby to exercise their human rights, which emerge in their fullness within their own environment, culture, local civilization and history, which define their own identity first and foremost as human beings.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa04">Therefore, when Yemen chooses not to participate in the voting on human rights situations in various States, it does so on the basis of its strong belief in the importance of complete respect for the identity of the human being. Such an identity, in the final analysis, is the essence of man's being and existence.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa05">Therefore, we will not participate in the voting and would like to explain and summarize our position as follows. First, politicization of human rights issues and their manipulation as a means of political coercion in order to realize economic, trade or other objectives are unacceptable. Secondly, to consider the human rights issue as a pretext for interference in others' internal affairs in order to spread hegemony over or effect the political dependence of a certain country or region is also unacceptable. Thirdly, fourthly and fifthly it is unacceptable to use a double standard in the application of rules, to adopt a selective approach in finding fault and to disregard the right to development or to understate its direct effect on human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa06">Finally, Yemen reiterates all the calls it made in the discussions of the Third Committee to the effect that it is better to conduct open dialogues among peoples than to resort to accusations and confrontation. We also believe it important to consider the essential reasons which open the door to human rights violations, such as poverty, ignorance and war.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa07">In addition, we would like to call for the development of the approach used by the international community in adopting legislation and resolutions in the field of human rights, in order to enable everyone to participate. This would foster the feeling that there is a genuine desire for the protection of human rights, without bias.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa08">My country's delegation will not participate in the voting on any of the draft resolutions now before us, with the exception of those adopted by consensus.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">We have expressed our position clearly in the Third Committee with regard to the issue of human rights in general, and with regard to the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in Iraq in particular. We still hold the same position.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa02">On the other hand, due to my country's inability to pay its contributions to the United Nations budget, as a result of the unjust economic embargo against Iraq, my country has been denied the right to vote, pursuant to Article 19 of the United Nations Charter. If we had the right to vote, we would vote against the draft resolutions on human rights situations in the Sudan, Cuba and Nigeria. This is because these are political draft resolutions that have nothing to do with human rights in those countries.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gambari</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">From the outset, my delegation had queried the purpose and intent of the draft resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in Nigeria", contained in <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.3</a>, which the General Assembly is now considering. It is quite clear to us that the authors are intent on pursuing their political agenda by prescribing for the people of Nigeria the type of political system they must adopt and when to do so. It is their scheme to use this very important issue of human rights as a vehicle for blatant interference in the internal affairs of my country. We are convinced that genuine concern for the people of Nigeria is the least consideration in the minds of the authors of this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">Incidentally, it is significant to note that the authors of the draft resolution on Nigeria are the same countries which have just voted against or abstained in the voting on the draft resolution on the right to development.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">The manner in which the draft resolution on the human rights situation in Nigeria was initiated and presented also leaves much to be desired. It was discussed in secrecy and was sprung as a surprise to our delegation in the Third Committee; it thus calls into question the credibility and, indeed, the very integrity of its authors.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">This draft resolution also does a disservice to the genuine efforts at the global level towards the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with the principles of non-selectivity, objectivity and impartiality. The content of this draft resolution is not based on any report of any of the principal organs or offices of the United Nations system. It makes no such reference, because there is none for consideration at this session.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Beyond procedural and presentation issues, the provisions of the draft resolution reflect a deliberate attempt by the authors to misrepresent grossly the situation of human rights and the democratization process in Nigeria. If they had wanted to be objective, or if they had taken pains to know it as it is, they would have spared all of us the travesty which this draft resolution represents.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">My delegation has outlined at every opportunity the concrete actions and steps taken by the Government of Nigeria towards ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights. I am proud to note again that we are one of the countries that have established an independent and fully functional National Human Rights Commission, which serves as a watchdog against any human rights abuses and provides an avenue for redress where any abuses may have occurred. Indeed, the Chairman and some members of the Commission will be making an official visit to the United Nations Headquarters here in New York next week to further explain the activities of the Commission, and we invite delegations to meet them. The legal system and our system of tribunals are constantly being looked at closely, and reviewed as necessary, in order to ensure that individuals are able to get free and fair trials in accordance with our laws and in accordance with relevant international standards.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">Those familiar with the Nigerian judiciary will bear testimony to the fact that it is a highly professional and credible one, which has always upheld the rule of law and the defence of justice for all. The Nigerian press remains one of the most vibrant and free presses anywhere in the world. The sheer number of independent and privately owned newspapers and radio and television stations in Nigeria speaks for itself.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">On the question of democratization, the Government of Nigeria in 1995 set out a carefully phased programme for transition to civil rule, with a terminal date of 1 October 1998. This is the year 1997, and the various stages in the transition programme are being implemented as set out in the timetable. Only last Saturday, 6 December 1997, legislative elections for state assemblies, which were contested by the five political parties, were held in the 36 states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The over 700 local government councils in Nigeria are today headed and administered by elected chairmen and councillors. I am happy to inform the Assembly that some of the elected officials at the local level joined their counterparts from all over the world to deliberate at the recently concluded World Conference of Mayors, held in Abuja, the federal capital of Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">The progress and achievements are there for anyone with an open mind to see. That is why, viewed against the backdrop of these concrete steps and efforts, the draft resolution before us on Nigeria is a gross misrepresentation of the actual situation in my country. The draft resolution is inappropriate, it is unfair and it is unbalanced. It is also prejudicial to the democratization process in Nigeria. That is why, at the Third Committee level, of the African countries -- which, after all, are closest to the true situation in Nigeria -- only three voted in support of the draft resolution. That is also why most Asian and Caribbean Member States did not support the draft resolution in the Third Committee. And that is why my delegation will again vote against this draft resolution. We urge all well-meaning members of this Assembly and true friends of Nigeria to join us in voting against it in this plenary meeting.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mukhopadhaya</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">My delegation has asked for the floor to make an explanation of vote on draft resolution III, entitled "Situation of human rights in Kosovo", contained in <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.3</a>, transmitting the report of the Third Committee on agenda item 112 (c), "Human rights questions: human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives".</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa02">India is committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights everywhere in the world. India is also committed to the preservation and protection of the territorial integrity, national sovereignty and independence of Member States of the United Nations. India also firmly adheres to the Charter principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of Member States. Furthermore, as a country of many languages and faiths that is committed to pluralism, India is firmly committed to the promotion and protection of the rights of all minorities within the framework of the unity and territorial integrity of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa03">Nevertheless, my delegation was compelled to vote against the resolution because it is perhaps the only resolution under this agenda item whose title refers to one part of a sovereign country as though that part of the country were not an integral part of the country concerned. It could therefore be seen as inconsistent with Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa04">It also seems to deviate from the principles of non-selectivity and indivisibility of human rights by appearing to view the situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in bits and parts, through a single ethnic prism. Moreover, since there is already a resolution on the situation of human rights in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) -- as part of an omnibus resolution that also covers the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia -- the right place to address the situation of human rights in Kosovo would appear to be in the context of that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa05">For the reason outlined above, we were obliged to vote against the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa06">My delegation also wishes to take this opportunity to make a brief explanation of position on preambular paragraph 7 of draft resolution XI of the same document, "Situation of human rights in the territories of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)".</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa07">With reference to the Special Rapporteur's observations on the death penalty, including the call for the abolition of the death penalty, contained in paragraph 36 of the report in <a href="../pdf/A-52-490.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/490</a>, we would like to underline that there are two views on whether the death penalty is compatible with international law or not. Those who have acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have undertaken to abolish capital punishment in their penal codes. The other view sees it as a legitimate penal provision within the competence of national legislation and provided for under article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to deal with</p>
	<blockquote id="pg031-bk01-pa08">"the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa09">Given this divergence of positions and provisions, it cannot be asserted that the death penalty is incompatible with applicable international law.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Cornette</span> <span class="nation">Guyana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa01">My delegation takes the floor in explanation of vote after the voting with regard to draft resolutions VI and XI of <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.3</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">While our delegation voted in favour of draft resolution VI, entitled "Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran", we would like to place on record our reservations regarding operative paragraph 4 (g), which calls for the regulation of capital punishment.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa03">Capital punishment is an intrinsic part of the Guyanese legal system. Consequently, my delegation cannot accept within this resolution attempts to impose conditions on the use of capital punishment by States. The language of operative paragraph 4 (g) seeks to define in broad and sweeping terms the nature of crimes for which capital punishment may be prescribed and to set limitations for its use. Since there exists no international consensus on the abolition of capital punishment, my delegation is concerned that the wording in this paragraph can be construed as an attempt to undermine internal judicial laws. We believe that it is the sovereign right of each State to implement a legal system which it deems appropriate and effective for its own particular circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa04">Further, Guyana supported draft resolution XI, entitled "Situation of human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)". However, we would like to express our reservations on the seventh preambular paragraph, which refers to</p>
	<blockquote id="pg031-bk02-pa05">"the reports and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa06">In this report, the Special Rapporteur deals with the issue of capital punishment and ultimately calls for the abolition of the death penalty. Guyana's objections to this are twofold. First of all, capital punishment is applied in Guyana and is considered a legitimate part of the State's judicial system. Moreover, since there exists no international consensus on the abolition of capital punishment, we cannot support the Rapporteur's statement in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa07">We would like to request that these comments be recorded in the official records.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Myaing</span> <span class="nation">Myanmar</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk01-pa01">My delegation voted against draft resolution VI, entitled "Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran" in the Committee and has continued to maintain that position at this plenary meeting. The reason we requested the floor today is to bring the attention of the Assembly to operative paragraph 4 (g), which is connected with the issue of capital punishment. The language used therein is in contravention of that of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Furthermore, no international consensus has yet been reached to abolish capital punishment. The inclusion of such a paragraph in the draft resolution is of concern to our delegation.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg032-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rodríguez San Martín</span> <span class="nation">Bolivia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa01">The General Assembly has taken a decision on the draft resolution entitled "Situation of human rights in Cuba", which expresses the international community's concern at the situation regarding fundamental freedoms in Cuba, on the basis of the report submitted by the Special Rapporteur. The Bolivian delegation voted in favour of this draft resolution because we are convinced that the full and effective enjoyment of human rights is a basic condition for development. We believe that participatory and representative democracy is the way to achieve sustainable development and stability for peoples. Respect for human rights is part and parcel of a democratic system, which is why the promotion and protection of human rights concerns us all.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Xie Bohua</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk03-pa01">I would like to make the following statement regarding our position under agenda item 112 (c) on draft resolution III, "Situation of human rights in Kosovo".</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk03-pa02">Respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity is an important principle of the Charter of the United Nations. On the basis of this principle, the delegation of China is never in favour of consideration, under the agenda item on human rights in individual countries, of issues relating to an area that falls within the territory of one country. We believe that Kosovo is part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is a sovereign country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk03-pa03">On the basis of that consideration, the delegation of China could not support the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in Kosovo that has just been adopted. Therefore, we abstained in the voting.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Foo</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa01">When the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran was acted on in the Third Committee, a total of 10 delegations placed on record their reservations on the statement on capital punishment contained in operative paragraph 4 (g). Today, a further three delegations have also recorded their reservations on the paragraph which is now contained in draft resolution VI in <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.3</a>. These 13 delegations had different voting positions on the resolution as a whole. However, all agreed that the language of operative paragraph 4 (g), in attempting to dictate what crimes should or should not be punished by the death penalty, was sweeping and intrusive and, indeed, out of line with general international law.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa02">Article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights explicitly permits capital punishment for</p>
	<blockquote id="pg032-bk04-pa03">"the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa04">It does not single out any particular crime. Even the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, in referring to the use of the death penalty in the country, did not make any value judgement on what crimes could or could not be penalized by capital punishment.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa05">My delegation would like to reiterate its objection to operative paragraph 4 (g).</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa06">My delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution "Situation of human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)" in the Third Committee on 26 November 1997. We have done so again today in the plenary. In supporting the resolution, however, my delegation would like to reiterate, for the record, our reservations on the seventh preambular paragraph of a resolution that was before the Assembly as draft resolution XI in <a href="../pdf/A-52-644-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/644/Add.3</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa07">The seventh preambular paragraph makes reference to the Special Rapporteur's report, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-52-490.pdf" class="pdf">document A/52/490</a>, which, <i>inter alia, </i>claims that the death penalty is incompatible with applicable international law. The Special Rapporteur's comments on the death penalty clearly exceed her mandate. Her claim that the death penalty is incompatible with international law is patently wrong.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa08">Representatives to the Third Committee will recall that when this draft resolution was taken up for action on 26 November 1997, a total of 22 countries expressed similar reservations, either in explanations of vote or in general statements, with regard to the Special Rapporteur's comments on the death penalty. A further three delegations have expressed reservations today in the plenary.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk04-pa09">It is hoped that the General Assembly will take due note of the reservations expressed by the 25 delegations which have spoken out on this issue. It is clear that there is no international consensus on the abolition of capital punishment.</p>

	<p id="pg033-bk01-pa01">First, on the question of human rights in Nigeria, our position is that we abstain, as it was in the Third Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk01-pa02">Still on the subject of Nigeria, our belief that we should abstain emanates from the fact that a lot of good is being done in Nigeria. Even the report or communiqué of the Commonwealth summit of Heads of State indicated that a lot of good is being done in Nigeria. The elections which have recently taken place at the state level are also indicative of all the good that is being done in Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk01-pa03">My delegation therefore believes that before adopting or drafting resolutions, those who are keen to do so should first embark upon a deeper study of a country to see if there have been any improvements or not. Let us, as delegations, avoid drafting resolutions routinely, because doing so would mean that we are not exercising justice at all, except to act on grudges.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk01-pa04">On the Sudan, we abstained, on the principle that the resolution being debated here fails to acknowledge all the efforts that have been exhibited in the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk01-pa05">We also abstained on Iran, because we believe that the Government of Iran is doing a lot of good and is moving in a good direction.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk01-pa06">On the question of capital punishment, my country and many developing countries still have capital punishment statutes, like many countries in the "supreme" world.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk01-pa07">On Kosovo, our position is that we abstain, because we believe that the national integrity of a State should be respected.</p>

	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa01">My delegation voted against the draft resolutions on the human rights situations in various countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran. My delegation does not agree with the manner in which the human rights situations of those countries are handled.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa02">My delegation has always maintained its position that a politicized approach to the human rights issue cannot in any way contribute to international cooperation in the field of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa03">In addition, I would like to put on record my delegation's reservations on operative paragraph 4 (g) of resolution VI, on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran, concerning the death penalty. My delegation believes that the decision as to whether to maintain or abolish the death penalty is a matter of the sovereign rights of individual States.</p>

	<p id="pg033-bk03-pa02">My delegation has just voted in favour of this text again, but wishes to express its reservations on the seventh preambular paragraph, which refers to the comments of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, whose mandate was to study the situation of human rights in the territories of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk03-pa03">The Rapporteur made several comments, in particular on capital punishment, which is still part of our national legislation and on which there is not yet an international consensus, so my delegation would like to put this statement on the record.</p>

	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa01">Costa Rica co-sponsored draft resolution XI, on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). We wish to reiterate our support for the seventh preambular paragraph, which refers to the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights concerning the human rights situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and, in particular, for her most recent report, of 17 October 1997, as well as for her comments on capital punishment.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa02">This is because Costa Rica is a party to the Additional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We believe that the Covenant is a fully legitimate and valid part of international law. It is clear that the Protocol is optional and therefore is binding only on those States parties that have adopted it.</p>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa03">Costa Rica is a party to the Protocol, and we abolished capital punishment more than 100 years ago. This happened because of the sensitivity of a woman, the wife of the President of the Republic, Doña Emilia Solórzano de Guardia, who urged her husband to submit a draft bill to Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly to that end. After a lengthy debate, the bill was adopted. Years later, the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica declared Doña Emilia an honoured daughter of the country.</p>

	<p id="pg035-bk05-pa01">I almost feel I should apologize to you, Mr. President, and to my colleagues -- and perhaps in particular my colleague from Swaziland -- for prolonging our proceedings at the end of a long day and a long week. However, this issue is important, and the purpose is one we all share.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk05-pa02">I am therefore not apologetic but pleased to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-52-L.66.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/52/L.66</a>, entitled "United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture". This draft resolution is wholly procedural and limited in scope and substance to <a href="../pdf/E-RES-1997-251.pdf" class="nolink">Economic and Social Council decision 1997/251</a>, by which the Economic and Social Council approved by consensus the request of the Commission on Human Rights to the General Assembly, in preparing for the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to proclaim 26 June United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, with a view to the total eradication of torture and the effective functioning of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk05-pa03">Since the agenda for the Third Committee this year does not include a specific item on torture, and owing to the fact that <a href="../pdf/E-RES-1997-251.pdf" class="nolink">Economic and Social Council decision 1997/251</a> has not been expressly endorsed but merely taken note of in the report of the Third Committee, Denmark has decided to present this draft resolution in the plenary of the Assembly. You may ask, "Why Denmark?" Simply because Denmark was the originator of Commission on Human Rights <a href="../pdf/A-RES-1997-38.pdf" class="nolink">resolution 1997/38</a>, which was adopted without a vote. It is my sincere hope that the present draft resolution can also be adopted without a vote.</p>
