	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1201.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1201</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council, recalling its previous decisions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular the statement of its President of 28 March 2002 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-8.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/8</a>), <a href="../pdf/S-RES-733(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 733 (1992)</a> of 23 January 1992 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1425(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1425 (2002)</a> of 22 July 2002, and taking note of the report of the Secretary-General of 25 October 2002 (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1201.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1201</a>), reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia and reaffirms its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of the country, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council firmly supports the unified approach of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to national reconciliation in Somalia, and reiterates its strong support for the Somalia National Reconciliation Process and the ongoing Somalia National Reconciliation Conference in Eldoret, Kenya, as sponsored by IGAD. The Council urges all parties throughout Somalia to participate in the process in accordance with the framework established by IGAD, and expects the decisions adopted throughout the process to be abided by and implemented expeditiously, including the Declaration on Cessation of Hostilities and the Structures and Principles of the Somalia National Reconciliation Process, signed by all delegates in Eldoret on 27 October 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Eldoret Declaration').</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the Eldoret Declaration as an important step towards the overriding objective of ending the violence and the suffering of the Somali people and bringing them the peace they so dearly deserve. The Council calls on all parties to cease all acts of violence and to respect the cessation of hostilities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council further welcomes the Joint Declaration issued by the involved parties in Mogadishu on 2 December 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Mogadishu Declaration'), including their stated commitment to cease all hostilities and jointly bring an end to all killings and abductions of innocent people and hijacking of public transportation in the city, as well as to solve all differences through dialogue and goodwill. The Council notes the further agreement reached on 4 December 2002 by involved parties to cooperate through peaceful means in order, inter alia, to reopen the International Airport and Seaport in Mogadishu and to restore public services in the city.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction the commencement of the second phase of the Somalia National Reconciliation Process in Eldoret on 2 December 2002 and welcomes this as a significant step forward. The Council will continue to follow this Process with keen interest and strongly encourages all parties to continue to participate constructively, in accordance with the framework established by the IGAD Technical Committee, in a spirit of tolerance and mutual accommodation during each phase of the Process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council commends the Government of Kenya for its special commitment as host and IGAD's Technical Committee, comprised of the three frontline States, Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti, for its crucial role in facilitating the Process. The Council strongly encourages their continued active and positive role in promoting the Process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council encourages Member States in a position to do so urgently to provide further contributions in support of the Process through the IGAD Technical Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council, condemning recent attacks on humanitarian personnel and civilians in Somalia, welcomes the agreement by all delegates in Eldoret to guarantee the security of all humanitarian and development personnel and installations, and urges them to take practical steps to grant safe and unfettered access to humanitarian personnel in their efforts to deliver assistance throughout Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council expresses serious concern regarding the situation of displaced persons in Somalia and urges relevant authorities and Member States to provide support for the return and reintegration of Somali refugees and the provision of urgent humanitarian assistance to, and protection for, those who have been internally displaced. It notes with particular concern the situation of 150,000 internally displaced persons in areas of Mogadishu that remain inaccessible to humanitarian workers. The Council calls on the armed factions to provide immediate safe access to these and other vulnerable populations throughout the country, consistent with the Eldoret Declaration and the Mogadishu Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council calls again on all Member States, entities and individuals to respect fully the arms embargo established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-733(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 733 (1992)</a>, as strengthened by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1425(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1425 (2002)</a>, and urges all Somali and regional parties as well as Government officials and other actors contacted outside the region to cooperate fully with the Panel of Experts in its quest for information related to the embargo, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1425(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1425 (2002)</a> and article 2.5 of the Eldoret Declaration. The Council appreciates the Panel's oral briefing on 14 November 2002 to the Council, through the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-751(1992).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 751 (1992)</a> concerning Somalia, and looks forward to the Panel's written report at the end of its mandated period.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue putting in place, in a coherent manner, preparatory activities on the ground for a comprehensive post-conflict peace-building mission in Somalia once security conditions permit, as stipulated in the statement by the President of the Council of 28 March 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">"The Security Council recognizes that a comprehensive post-conflict programme for disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration will be an important contribution for peace and stability in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">"The Security Council encourages the Secretary-General to support actively the IGAD-sponsored Somalia National Reconciliation Process and the ongoing Conference in Eldoret.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">"The Security Council expresses its commitment to assist the parties in the implementation of the steps and conclusions for peace, as adopted throughout the Somalia National Reconciliation Process."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-35.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
