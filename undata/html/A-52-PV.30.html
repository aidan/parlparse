	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">This morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">The five non-permanent outgoing members are the following: Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and the Republic of Korea. These five States cannot be re-elected and therefore their names should not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">Apart from the five permanent members, the Security Council will include in 1998 the following States: Costa Rica, Japan, Kenya, Portugal and Sweden. The names of those States, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot papers.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">Of the five non-permanent members which will remain in office in 1998, two are from Africa and Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean and two are from Western European and other States.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">Consequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December 1963, the five non-permanent members should be elected according to the following pattern: three from Africa and Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa06">In accordance with established practice, there is an understanding to the effect that, of the three States to be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from Africa and one from Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa07">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa08">In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa09">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa07">I request representatives to use only those ballot papers that have been distributed and to write on them the names of the five States for which they wish to vote.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa08">A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a ballot paper which do not belong to that region will not be counted.</p>
