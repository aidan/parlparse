</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01"> Today's Security Council meeting reflects the Council's determination to confront reality rather than escape from it; to recognize an evil rather than excuse it. The Council's decision a year ago to establish the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) was a swift and concrete reaction to the terrorist attacks of 11 September. It showed that the Council was willing to act, as well as speak, in defence of every country and every citizen threatened by international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">Terrorism is a global threat with global effects. Its methods are murder and mayhem, but its consequences affect every aspect of the United Nations agenda -- from development to peace, to human rights and the rule of law. No part of our mission is safe from the effects of terrorism, and no part of the world is immune from this scourge. By its very nature, terrorism is an assault on the fundamental principles of law, order, human rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes upon which the United Nations is established. Countering terrorism, therefore, is in the interest not only of States and intergovernmental institutions, but also of local, national and global civil society. This Organization therefore has a clear obligation to deal with this global threat. But it is also well placed to do so. The United Nations has an indispensable role to play in providing the legal and organizational framework within which the international campaign against terrorism can unfold.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Let me here pay tribute to the Counter-Terrorism Committee and its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for its work in ensuring the implementation by all Member States of an effective counter-terrorism strategy. Through its work, the CTC has become an important agent for international consensus on counter-terrorism, calling for the effective implementation of the 12 international anti-terrorism conventions. Moreover, the CTC has helped to strengthen global capacity in this field through a coordinated programme of needs-assessment and technical assistance. Let me also say that I very much welcome the Chairman's intention to consult with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Last autumn, to identify the long-term implications and broad policy dimensions of terrorism for the United Nations, I set up a Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorism. It combined the expertise of key agencies, programmes and departments within the Organization with that of independent specialists. On 28 June this year, the Group submitted a report with recommendations on steps that the United Nations can take. The report, which I made public on 10 September, contains proposals for a strategic definition of priorities to orient the Organization's work in this complex field. I endorse the three-pronged strategy suggested by the report.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">When approaching issues related to terrorism, the United Nations will set itself three goals: dissuasion, denial and cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">First, we must dissuade the would-be perpetrators of terror by setting effective norms and implementing relevant legal instruments, by mounting an active public information campaign and by rallying an international consensus behind the fight against terrorism. To achieve effective dissuasion, it is essential to remember that the fight against terrorism is above all a fight to preserve fundamental rights and sustain the rule of law. By their very nature, terrorist acts are grave violations of human rights. Therefore, to pursue security at the expense of human rights is short-sighted, self-contradictory and, in the long run, self-defeating. In places where human rights and democratic values are lacking, disaffected groups are more likely to opt for a path of violence or to sympathize with those who do.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">Secondly, we must deny would-be terrorists the opportunity to commit their dreadful acts. We can do this by supporting the efforts of the Counter-Terrorism Committee to monitor compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>; by greater efforts to achieve disarmament, especially through strengthening global norms against the use or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and by giving technical support to States seeking to curb the flow of arms, funds and technology to terrorist cells.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">To be effective and sustainable, a strategy of denial must be grounded in both international and domestic law. It is not good enough to sign the key international instruments. We must implement them as well.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">Given the levels of inhumanity to which modern-day terrorists have descended, efforts to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have assumed new urgency.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">Other legal instruments -- such as those that deal with transnational crime, narcotics and money-laundering -- are essential to denying sources of finance for terrorist networks. States must ensure that these instruments are adopted and effectively applied. Moreover, the struggle against terrorism demands closer analysis of its links with crime, narcotics and the illicit trade in weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">There may, in addition, be a need for the General Assembly to consider making more resources available to ensure that the work of the CTC is effective and sustainable over the long-term. As I have mentioned in the past, the CTC's unprecedented effort to review national reports on the implementation of international legal instruments relating to terrorism has stretched, almost to breaking point, the Secretariat's resources for processing documentation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa12">Thirdly, we must sustain cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, on as broad a basis as possible, while encouraging subregional, regional and global organizations to join forces in a common campaign. In overcoming as elusive a transnational threat as terrorism, cooperation is essential. Fortunately, there has been some progress. The United Nations is committed to working with international partners in the fight against terrorism and to achieving unity of purpose and action. Just as terrorism must never be excused, so genuine grievances must never be ignored simply because terrorism is committed in their name. It does not take away from the justice of a cause that a few wicked men or women murder in its name. It only makes it more urgent that the cause is addressed, the grievances heard and the wrong put right.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa13">As the United Nations unites to defeat terrorism in the months and years ahead, we must act with equal determination to solve the political disputes and longstanding conflicts which generate support for terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa14">To do so is not to reward terrorism or its perpetrators, it is to deny them the opportunity to find refuge in any cause, any country. Only then can we truly say that the war on terrorism has been won.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his statement. I now call on the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">In my national capacity may I warmly welcome you to the presidency of the Security Council for this month. You have our full support. May I express my delegation's gratitude for the very constructive presidency of your predecessor, Ambassador Tafrov.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">I am extremely grateful to the Secretary-General for joining us this morning on this important subject and I would like to express my gratitude to him and through him for the solid support which the Secretariat has shown under his leadership over the past year.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">I speak to you this morning against the sombre background which the Secretary-General has so eloquently set out. One year ago today, the CTC held its first ever meeting to discuss how it would fulfil the mandate set by the Security Council to monitor the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The task which faced us then was challenging; to begin a dialogue with every Member State on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, to find out what measures Governments had put in place already and what more needed to be done to ensure that there was no support, active or passive, for terrorism, and to work with the resolve demanded by the Council's determination in paragraph 8 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to take all necessary steps to ensure the full implementation of that resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">The way in which the CTC has responded to this challenge is well known to the Council through the quarterly reports I have made on behalf of the Committee, and through the CTC's 90-day work programmes, the fifth of which, issued recently as <a href="../pdf/S-2002-1075.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2002/1075</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">Cooperation has the first hallmark of the CTC's modus operandi, because <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, while mandatory on all Member States, has to be implemented willingly by Governments to make a difference. Dialogue and partnerships with Governments is essential in order to be successful in raising global standards against terrorism. The natural ally of partnership is transparency, which I hope has become our second hallmark.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">The CTC is not a tribunal and does not judge States, but it does expect every State to work at its fastest possible speed to implement the far-reaching obligations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. They therefore all need to know, all the time, how the CTC is operating and why.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">There is still much more to do before terrorists find that there is no safe haven, because the bar against terrorism has been raised in every country. The CTC will continue to offer encouragement, advice and guidance to States on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It will focus, when reviewing reports or working on assistance, on the areas which need to be tackled first. For most States that will be by ensuring that they have, first, legislation in place covering all aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and a process in hand for ratifying as soon as possible the twelve international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism. Secondly, States must have effective executive machinery for preventing and suppressing terrorist financing.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The CTC will continue to coordinate and facilitate the provision of technical assistance focusing on these priority areas. There is now, on the CTC's web site (www.un.org/sc/ctc) a comprehensive directory of information and sources of assistance in the field of counter-terrorism, which has been put together as a tool for States. Our experts are in direct contact with Permanent Missions to discuss the provision of assistance. They will do whatever they can to help States access the help they need, and you will find that the experts may have their own ideas about where assistance might be helpful, drawing on their knowledge of what assistance programmes are available, what best practice has been established around the world and what gaps have been identified in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> implementation, in the State concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">While the response from the United Nations membership to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has been remarkable, it has not yet quite been universal. Let me draw the Council's attention to the fact that 16 Member States have not yet filed a report with the CTC. Of these, 7 have not made any kind of written contact; they are: Chad, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Swaziland and Tonga. The CTC is actively following up, with a view to offering advice and assistance to these States on preparing a report. The CTC urges all these States to submit a report, and to be in dialogue with the Committee on the steps needed to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">The CTC does not expect any State to report that it has fully implemented <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Indeed, as I have said before in the Council, the CTC will not declare any State "fully compliant". But it does expect every State to strengthen its capacity against terrorism by implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> at its fastest capable speed.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa11">Achieving this will be easier for individual States if they work within the collective effort of their region. Regional organizations must ensure that no gaps are left within their overall territory. To help them in this task, the CTC will deepen its relationships with international, regional and sub-regional organizations during the coming work period. It will invite them to contribute information on their activities, which can be collated so that each organization can be aware of, and glean ideas from, the activities of sister organisations around the world. We will work closely with them on the provision of assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa12">The CTC will remain in touch with Sergio Vieira de Mello, the new High Commissioner for Human Rights, in the context of the Committee's wish to remain fully aware of the interaction of its work with human rights concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa13">Let me say something about how the global environment for terrorists has changed since October 2001, when the CTC was created. Forty meetings, eighty-three sub-committee meetings and nineteen open briefings later, I am honoured to set out some of the achievements in the counter-terrorism field to which the CTC has contributed. As you will see from the following examples, global activity on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is taking place far beyond the walls of conference room 7, in virtually every capital of every Member State of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa14">At the national level Governments throughout the world have responded to the challenge laid down in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> to prevent and suppress terrorism. In almost every case, parliaments have begun to consider or adopt new laws and Governments have reviewed the strength of their institutions to fight terrorism. As required by the resolution, States have looked again at the 12 international conventions and protocols related to terrorism. Ratifications have gone up significantly since July a year ago. Then, only Botswana and the United Kingdom had ratified all 12 instruments; today, 24 States have done so. We want the pace to accelerate further.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa15">At the regional level, States have worked together in practical ways, often through their regional organizations, to improve regional capacity against terrorism. They have recognized that no country is safe from terrorism if its neighbour is not. Let me give a few examples. The European Union (EU), already a well-connected region, has introduced new measures aimed at tackling terrorism, such as the Common European arrest warrant. Across the Atlantic, the Organization of American States (OAS) has agreed to a regional convention and has developed practical ways of sharing best practice and coordinating on region-wide issues such as border security.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa16">Last month, members of the African Union adopted an action plan that sets out their own determination to fight terrorism. The CTC has had constructive contact with the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and Pacific Islands Forum. We shall continue our exchanges with over 30 international, regional and subregional organizations from every region of the world. It is welcome that they have tackled counter-terrorism, a new area for many of those organizations, with seriousness and determination.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa17">At the global level, the CTC has enjoyed unprecedented support from the United Nations membership for its efforts to turn the global consensus on fighting terrorism into practical action. One hundred and seventy-four Member States and five others have reported to the CTC on the action taken and planned, and the dialogue has continued. The CTC has responded to almost all of those first reports and has begun to review the 86 follow-up reports that States have provided. To date, the total number of reports received by the CTC stands at 265. Awareness of what we are doing, and of what we need to know, is close to universal.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa18">Cooperation between States, particularly in the form of assistance, has increased. More and more States and organizations are looking at what they have to offer and are informing the Committee of their willingness to help where needed. Many States have begun to provide help, and others have moved quickly to turn commitments into action on the ground. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development are developing programmes to help States put in place measures to stop their financial systems from being abused by terrorists. The Commonwealth Secretariat, with major funding from the United Kingdom and Canada, is offering help to its 46 members and others with legislative drafting. The United States has already offered training to representatives of over 48 countries.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa19">Let me close by paying tribute to the work of all members of the Committee, the Vice-Chairmen, the experts and the Secretariat. I recognize the strains we have placed on the Secretariat, but we have all had to raise our game on this important subject. Everyone has worked with dedication, good will and increasing professionalism. I should particularly like to mention for tribute the three leaving experts of our team, Dr. Walter Gehr, Ms. Heidi Broekhuis and Mr. Lotfi Daoues, who have all served with distinction on that team. I should also like to pay tribute to the support that I have had from my own delegation, notably from Anna Clunes and Juliet Gilbert.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa20">The Security Council has placed confidence in the Bureau to continue for a further six-month period, and I am grateful to the Council for that. I thank the Vice-Chairmen, Ambassadors Koonjul, Lavrov and Valdivieso, for steering the work of the CTC and its subcommittees. Together we are determined to make the next months even more productive.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Koonjul</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">Since this is the first formal meeting under your presidency, let me, first of all, convey my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption as President of the Security Council for the month of October. Let me also place on record our warm thanks to your predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Tafrov of Bulgaria, for his wise stewardship of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">Heartiest congratulations go to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for the outstanding work he and his team continue to do in the Committee. Despite the demanding nature of the task, Ambassador Greenstock has steered the work of the Committee not only with resolute determination and unmatched professionalism, but also with great openness and transparency. We are pleased to learn that he will continue to chair the Committee for the next six months. We will continue to cooperate closely with him, and we assure him of our full support.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">Let me also express my deep appreciation for the outstanding work performed by the team of the counter-terrorism experts, whose contribution to the work of the CTC has been extremely valuable and positive. I seize this opportunity to wish Dr. Gehr, Mr. Daoues and Ms. Broekhuis, who, I understand, will be leaving us shortly, plenty of success in their new endeavours. We will indeed miss them.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">We welcome the opportunity to discuss the state of implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> almost exactly one year after it was adopted on 28 September 2001. It is a matter of great success for the United Nations that 173 Members of the United Nations community submitted their reports, as required by the resolution. That shows the commitment of the international community to tackle the problem of terrorism in a serious manner. Mauritius fully subscribes to the assessment made in this respect by Ambassador Greenstock, the Chairman of the CTC. We are pleased with the progress made, and we are confident that Member States will continue to take all necessary measures to comply fully with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Immediately after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, Mauritius strengthened its legislative and administrative mechanisms in order to address the problems of terrorism. In our initial report, submitted to the CTC in December, we highlighted the major steps we had taken and which we proposed to take in order to combat terrorism. In July 2002, when we submitted our reply, we reported on the various actions taken at the national level. Several pieces of legislations were passed, among others the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the Financial Intelligence and Anti-Money-Laundering Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Banking Act and the Financial Services Regulations, which govern our offshore activities as well as our local banking sector, do not provide for any hawala-type banking system. Since 1990, Mauritius has no foreign exchange restrictions, and transactions through an informal banking system are, therefore, neither convenient nor profitable.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">Mauritius has also become a party to the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Conscious of the threat posed by terrorism to national, regional and international peace and security, Mauritius has aligned itself with all international and regional initiatives in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">We recognize the difficulties many countries are facing in effectively implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Those difficulties range from the lack of necessary expertise to the total absence of regulatory and legislative frameworks. We are pleased that the CTC is paying particular attention to the question of assistance, and we are grateful to all those countries, institutions and agencies that have expressed their readiness to extend assistance in the various areas. We would therefore encourage those countries which have problems to get in touch with the CTC or the experts in order to discuss their specific problems. At the same time, we renew our appeal to those Member States who have not submitted their initial reports to do so as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">The cornerstone of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is to develop a truly comprehensive and concerted approach to robustly deal with the scourge of terrorism, which manifested itself in the most disastrous and evil manner on 11 September 2001. It is absolutely imperative that all nations work individually and collectively to ensure that the world does not witness a repetition of those acts. The work of the CTC therefore remains extremely relevant inasmuch as it can assist and monitor legislative, judicial and administrative mechanisms put in place by Member States to fight terrorism. The CTC is fully aware of the fact that not all countries are or can be at the same level of implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We therefore support the gradual approach that the CTC is following and which gives time to allow for capacity-building at the national level and to respond to the obligations of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">We believe that the monitoring exercise should continue until we are satisfied that each country has been equipped legislatively and administratively to create a terrorist-proof society. In this respect, however, care must be taken to ensure that basic individual human rights are not sacrificed in an obsessive drive to fight terrorism. Here I would like to recall the very insightful statement that the Secretary-General has just made. The place of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism has, indeed, been the object of extensive deliberations in many parts of the world. There is, indeed, a very fine line between the respect of fundamental rights and the need for a country to take all necessary measures to prevent terror-related activities.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">While <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> does not contain any specific provision concerning respect for human rights, it is important that the concept be clearly embodied in all national legislation governing the fight against terrorism. We therefore welcome the idea that the CTC will remain in touch with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Sergio de Mello. Likewise, it will be important for the international community to reach agreement as quickly as possible on an acceptable definition of terrorism. We sincerely hope that work in that respect will continue in the appropriate forum.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">Finally, I take this opportunity to thank all the Members for the support that they have extended to me as Chairman of Sub-Committee B. I look forward to enjoying the same trust and cooperation for the next three months.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Mauritius for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">Allow me to express our appreciation to you, Sir, for convening this meeting. Allow me also to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month. I should like to express our thanks to Ambassador Tafrov for his efforts during his presidency of the Security Council last month. I should also like to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the important statement that he delivered at the start of this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">We meet one year after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the establishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), which were the international response to the terrorist acts perpetrated against the United States of America on 11 September 2001. My delegation must express its utmost appreciation to the Chairman of the CTC, Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock, to his Vice-Chairmen and to the other members of the Committee, as well as to the experts who reviewed and discussed the reports submitted by States -- which now number in the hundreds. I must also express our thanks to the Secretariat, which contributed effectively to the work of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The success of the CTC was due to its open dialogue with Governments, conducted in a climate of transparency. The response of the international community to the CTC also contributed greatly to its success, the principal objective of the Committee being to promote and to enhance mechanisms in Member States for combating terrorism and for enhancing their abilities to review legislation against terrorism and to fill any gaps in such legislation in accordance with the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The objective also included filling gaps in national legislations in order to bring proceedings against terrorists, to deny them the ability to perpetrate their acts, to prosecute them and to deny impunity to anyone in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">As a member of the Security Council, Syria welcomes the continuation of the work of the Committee, the appointment of its officers and the continuation of Ambassador Greenstock as the Committee's Chairman. Syria also welcomes the plan for the next 90-day period.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">The Syrian delegation is particularly appreciative of Ambassador Greenstock's position of not allowing anyone to use <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> or the CTC for narrow interests. He has repeatedly stated, including today, that the CTC is not a tribunal, although it does expect all States to cooperate with it in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Our delegation welcomes the efforts made by the CTC to assist States which expressed a need for particular assistance in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, whether directly or through States that have expressed their readiness to provide such assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">The success of the Committee's endeavours was also enhanced by the cooperation at the regional, subregional and international levels in order to address terrorist crimes in all their manifestations, especially transnational crimes. Here, we should like to point to the efforts within the League of Arab States and the Arab Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism. The Syrian Arab Republic was among the first States to submit their initial report to the CTC. We have also recently submitted our second report, including responses to the various questions posed by the Committee. A solid legislative foundation for combating terrorism is essential to ensuring progress in dealing with this threat within the framework of international law, as are full respect for human and civil and political rights and preventing their abuse under the pretext of combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">In the general debate of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic reiterated the condemnation of the Arab States of the terrorist attacks on the United States of America and their solidarity with the families of the victims. A year after the attacks, the world is puzzled to see that, despite all this; despite the efforts of the CTC; and despite the fact that the events have been officially linked to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime, the blame has now been shifted to Arab States, some of which are being threatened though none played a role in the attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">The Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms its call for further effective international cooperation, within the framework of the United Nations and international legitimacy, to eradicate terrorism and to defeat that dangerous scourge.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Franco</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I congratulate you, Sir, on assuming your new responsibilities. I also commend Ambassador Tafrov for his work last month.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">I wish to convey the apologies of Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso, the Vice-Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), who, for reasons beyond his control, is unable to be present here today.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">We appreciate the work and leadership of Ambassador Greenstock in his capacity as Chairman of the CTC and thank him for his comments today, which serve to elucidate the current political standing of this issue in the Security Council. My delegation associates itself with the statement to be made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the States members of the Rio Group.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">In response to your invitation, Sir, I take this opportunity to offer some thoughts on the role of the CTC on the basis of six general questions.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">First, what is the added value of the CTC? I feel that the Committee's greatest contribution has been to help forge a global and uniform cooperation framework to combat terrorism. Today, we, as members of the international community, are duty-bound to comply with certain minimum, globally accepted standards, as defined in imperative terms in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The CTC has done a great deal of work in information-gathering and follow-up. It has succeeded in persuading the great majority of States to adjust their internal structures to the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and has arranged assistance for others that have requested such help in complying with the Security Council's requirements.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">Secondly, what results has the CTC achieved in the fight against terrorism? The CTC has achieved many positive results. We attach tremendous importance to its successes in the area of cooperation. We sincerely applaud the constructive spirit in which States have faced up to their responsibilities. However, these achievements can be regarded neither as final objectives in and of themselves, nor as points of arrival. They are simply points of departure. They are a contribution that has made it possible to breathe juridical life into a set of national and international instruments and machinery that have established an environment more conducive to combating terrorism. Subsequent action will allow the achievement of more tangible results aimed at eradicating the direst threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">Thirdly, what is the greatest risk of the CTC? The greatest risk of the Committee, in our opinion, lies in the possibility that States may believe that complying with it is tantamount to accomplishing the fight against terrorism. This is a very dangerous impression. A country receives a certificate of good conduct from the experts and believes that this signals the end of its work. Another risk is that the reporting mechanism may become exhausted. We are gradually moving in that direction and there is an urgent need to review the scope of the challenges and the proportionality of our response.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">Fourthly, what will the major challenges to the CTC be in the future? In our opinion, the greatest challenge to the CTC is to develop actions and decisions specifically targeting States, individuals or organizations that are directly or indirectly involved in terrorist activities. In other words, we must move from the general framework of cooperation to its practical application through the consideration of specific cases. In order to do this, we feel that the CTC will require a re-evaluated and, possibly, a modified mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1390(2002).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1390 (2002)</a> could serve as the initial frame of reference for that application. In cases in which there is consensus among the 15 members of the Committee, terrorism in specific regions of the world could be another specific sphere of application. Although we acknowledge the great progress achieved by the CTC, we believe that the time has come to consider positively the elaboration of specific lists of terrorist individuals and groups in order to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> with full force. The CTC must draw specific distinctions between given cases if it does not wish in the middle term to become a body whose main working mechanism has been exhausted.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Fifthly, should we have the CTC operate like a sanctions committee? We definitely should not. Sanctions committees and the CTC are fundamentally different animals. While the former have specific targets that are the subject of sanctions aimed at inducing changes in conduct, generally in a given territory, the latter is establishing a global framework of cooperation that is binding on all States. That is why we must be very cautious with the comparisons that are frequently made between the CTC and the sanctions committees, as if they were the same thing. The functioning of each must be considered on its own terms.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">Sixthly, how can we ensure effective cooperation with the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>? This is an area in which we have not yet established genuine points of contact and exchange. In an ideal world of effective cooperation, the CTC's existence would contribute to the effectiveness of the work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. On 30 September 2002, during the informal consultations devoted to a political review of the work of that Committee, we sought to draw the attention of Council members to this. But it is clear that there is still a gap between the cooperation framework set up by the CTC and its effective application to specific cases, including the areas covered by the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I should like to congratulate you very warmly, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency for the month of October. I should also like to thank you -- and all previous speakers -- very sincerely for the very kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">As a country associated with the European Union, Bulgaria fully associates itself with the statement to be made later by the representative of Denmark on behalf of the Union. But I should also like to make some comments in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">One year ago, the great majority of United Nations Members voiced their unreserved support to the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is now clear that the activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee have yielded significant tangible results. Indeed, the majority of States Members of the United Nations and a large number of international and regional organizations have committed themselves actively to the common endeavour to enhance the capacity of States to combat terrorism. They have done so in the context of the continued threat to international security from a variety of terrorist organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">Bulgaria would like to pay tribute to the very important and positive contribution of the Chairman of the Committee, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, who has wholeheartedly and with great skill dedicated himself to the cause of combating terrorism. We are very grateful to him for his personal commitment, and for the commitment of the United Kingdom Mission, and we are glad that he is ready to continue with his work.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">My delegation would also like to thank the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee, Ambassadors Koonjul, Lavrov and Valdivieso, who, together with the entire Committee, have worked in a truly transparent manner that, in my opinion, is one of the most important and successful aspects of the functioning of the Committee during its first year.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">The Counter-Terrorism Committee has, to a large extent, been the foundation of a global coalition against terrorism. We note that 174 countries Members of the United Nations have submitted their national reports. We take this opportunity to appeal to the countries that have not yet submitted their reports to do so, although we acknowledge the difficulties that they may encounter in doing so. It is time for those experiencing difficulties to request assistance from the Counter-Terrorism Committee so that they can comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">It is very important to ensure that there are no missing links in the chain of the United Nations system with regard to this struggle, because terrorist organizations are inventive and are known to exploit any gaps or weaknesses in the network of cooperation among States.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">Another important element in the fight against terrorism is the ratification of the 12 international conventions that address counter-terrorism issues. Bulgaria is proud to be one of the 24 countries to have ratified them all. The implementation of the provisions of those international instruments is also of critical importance.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">In the coming months, the Counter-Terrorism Committee will be considering the next cycle of reports submitted by Member States under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We should acknowledge that the implementation of the provisions of that resolution is, as Ambassador Greenstock just said, a process whose end cannot really be anticipated. It is a very lengthy undertaking, and we are far from having reached the stage where all States Members of the United Nations are in a position to say that they are in full compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is clear that the capacity of Member States to comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is very uneven.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">Bulgaria supports the CTC's next 90-day work programme. It seems appropriate that the Committee should focus its attention on the existing lacunae, by which I mean identifying areas in which Member States need technical assistance. Maximum use should be made of the capacity and resources that are available in the United Nations system and in other international organizations and institutions. We believe that that is a very important aspect.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">Another point that I wish to raise is that Member States should encompass in their legislation and their administrative practices the issues of criminalizing terrorism and terrorist acts and halting the financing of terrorism. This is an extremely complex set of issues, and we applaud the Committee's efforts to work closely with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa12">Bulgaria has often stated and today reiterates that the regional and subregional dimensions are of critical importance in combating terrorism. Very often, regional and subregional organizations are truly the best adapted to the fight against terrorism, especially with regard to the financing of terrorism and to the links between organized crime and terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa13">In that connection, I would recall that my capital, Sofia, was the site of a regional forum last June devoted to combating terrorism, with the participation of representatives of all South-Eastern European countries, of the European Union, of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and of the United Nations. This was, in our view, an extremely useful and positive event. Among the measures agreed at the conference was, for example, the implementation of a unified travel document format for citizens of the region's countries.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa14">As I have previously emphasized, we feel that the OSCE is a regional organization that could play a more important role in fighting terrorism. For example, I could cite OSCE Permanent Council decision 487 of 2002, whereby the OSCE requires its members to fill out and submit to the Financial Action Task Force a self-assessment questionnaire on compliance with recommendations for combating the financing of terrorism. My country wished to set an example of promptness in that regard, and, at the beginning of September, Bulgaria submitted that questionnaire to the Task Force.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa15">The exchange of information among States from all regions seems to us a very important element in the fight against terrorism. It is very important to expand the legal framework of such exchanges. As an example, I should like to mention the legal agreement concluded between two neighbouring countries, Bulgaria and Romania. My country is continuing its legislative efforts in the fight against terrorism. The Bulgarian Parliament recently adopted a law against the financing of terrorism and is preparing to adopt, in the coming weeks, important amendments to the law against money-laundering.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa16">Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the work of the experts appointed to advise the Counter-Terrorism Committee, to thank the outgoing experts for their work and to reiterate that my delegation and my country will continue to give their full support to the Committee's work.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Traoré</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and to assure you of my full cooperation. My congratulations go also to your predecessor, Ambassador Tafrov, on the remarkable manner in which he conducted our work. My delegation thanks you for having organized this meeting on threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. I should also like to thank the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for his report to the Council as well as for the supplementary information that he has given us. In addition, I should like to express our gratitude to the other members of the Bureau and to the support staff for their high-quality contribution to the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Since the sad events of 11 September 2001, the issue of terrorism and its many consequences has strengthened the international community's determination to take aggressive and forceful measures to eradicate that scourge. The implementation of various Security Council and General Assembly resolutions as well as measures taken by Member States and by subregional, regional and international organizations are part of that scheme. We welcome the cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the various actors, and we encourage them to persevere on that path. We are convinced that that would allow us, among other things, to coordinate the activities of countries within their respective organizations and to benefit from the comparative advantages that that would offer.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">One year after the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, and after three reviews of the Committee's work, one must welcome the submission of 265 reports, of which 179 are initial reports and 86 are follow-up reports. An examination of most of them reveals not only the political will of Member States but also the Committee's determination to shoulder its responsibilities effectively and promptly. My delegation welcomes the work accomplished by the experts, particularly in the context of providing assistance to Member States that have expressed the need for it. We appreciate the creation of a directory web site on the issue, which deserves to be continually expanded. Bilateral contacts between countries requesting and furnishing assistance must be further coordinated by the experts.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">The fight against terrorism is a long-term challenge. Therefore, I should like to make an urgent appeal to the donor community to respond favourably to the needs expressed by various States, with a view to maintaining the current momentum. We urge the Committee to pursue its work with transparency, focusing its attention on the lessons learned from examining the initial reports, which will allow it to better orient its consideration of the follow-up reports and thus to formulate useful recommendations for Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In conclusion, my delegation supports the decision to renew the mandate of the Committee and of its Bureau, as well as the new work programme submitted for our consideration.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aguilar Zinser</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">My country wishes to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council, and we wish you every success in this difficult month. Our appreciation goes also to the Ambassador of Bulgaria for the manner in which he conducted the work of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">My delegation associates itself with the statement to be made later by the delegation of Costa Rica on behalf of the Rio Group. Mexico wishes to convey its very sincere and well-deserved congratulations and its appreciation to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock for the wise and efficient manner in which he has guided the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee since its inception. We hope that we can continue to rely on his leadership, and my country reaffirms its fullest support for the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">In the year that has elapsed since its establishment, the Committee has demonstrated its dynamism and its importance to the United Nations. I wish also to note the work of the Vice-Chairmen -- Ambassador Valdivieso, Ambassador Koonjul and Ambassador Lavrov -- who, along with Ambassador Greenstock, form an excellent team. The team of officials from the United Kingdom Mission, the outstanding work done by the Secretariat -- and here Mexico wishes to pay particular tribute to Ms. Sujata Mehta for her tireless work in the Committee -- all of these factors have contributed to the success of the Committee's work. It is also important to commend the work done by the experts and their team of assistants. They are quite simply the linchpin of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">The work of the Committee and of its experts in arranging the provision of technical assistance is, at this stage, acting as a kind of backbone, inasmuch as it provides support for cooperation within the Committee, thereby enabling the States Members of the United Nations to enhance their capacity to respond to terrorist acts. The dialogue between Member States and the experts should be interactive, so that countries can decide on the type and scope of the assistance that they wish to receive.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">Each and every one of us, as Members of the United Nations, must make an effort at the national level to adapt our juridical institutions and our political and legal instruments to this undertaking, to which the international community is committed. Mexico has undertaken these steps in the full understanding of its responsibilities. Mexico believes that the combat against terrorism requires concerted action on the part of authorities at various levels. This commitment on the part of the Mexican authorities is attested to by the fact that at this meeting the delegation of Mexico includes the Governor of the state of Michoacán, Mr. Lázaro Cárdenas Batel, and the Governor of the state of Oaxaca, Mr. José Murat, who are here to observe the Committee's work.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">We believe that one of the main contributions of the Committee is its compilation of the publicly available information concerning the practices of States in the combat against terrorism. This compilation will definitely facilitate the study of comparative international law in this field.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">Thanks to the work of the Committee, we are moving towards a process of uniformity and complementarity among the legal systems and judicial processes of States, which will enable us to work together to combat this common enemy.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">One of the basic principles underlying the struggle against terrorism is respect for international law and for human rights. If this were not so, the legitimacy and unity of our efforts would be significantly diminished and undermined. We must resolutely defend the fundamental principles that govern our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">Terrorism, in its many forms and its manifestations, represents an assault on fundamental human values: understanding, human compassion and tolerance. Terrorism is sometimes perversely used in the name of democratic freedoms to attack those very freedoms. Terrorism exploits those freedoms and attacks them. Terrorists penetrate open spaces; they take advantage of the transparency of the information and communications media; they use the media as a weapon and financial systems to their advantage; and they randomly attack innocent victims who are going about their daily business.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">Given their perverse nature, their fanaticism, their anonymity and their cruelty and brutality in selecting targets and victims without any consideration for the lives of women, children and innocent people, terrorists must be combated by every means available. But the fight against terrorism presupposes some very painful decisions for societies: the establishment of monitoring and surveillance systems that limit our freedoms, the building of barriers that impede our freedom of movement, and restrictions on some of our rights because of the struggle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">These measures affect all of us. They are preventive measures, the purpose of which is to prevent terrorist acts. But they also represent after-effects and damage, from which all of us suffer. They harm the quality of our lives and the ways in which we live together.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">Given this, the international community, and the United Nations in particular, must be very vigilant. We must clearly bear in mind the costs of each and every one of our actions, and we must be certain that the measures we propose and take are fully justified and truly effective.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa13">We must scrupulously combine the fight against terrorism with the defence of our freedoms and of human and civil rights. We cannot play the game the terrorists play. However effective we may be in instituting precautionary and preventive measures, terrorism will take advantage of every crack. No security measure will render us immune to terrorism. We are therefore compelled to make a substantive response in our fight against terrorism, a fundamental response that goes to the core and the root of the impulses that motivate such acts. The best, most effective weapons will be economic and social development, the quest for peace through broad-ranging and sustained efforts, focused attention to humanitarian issues triggered by conflict, the promotion of values, education and health care. The United Nations has a central role to play in all of these critical tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa14">We are aware that the Committee's mandate does not include monitoring human rights, because other bodies exist for that purpose. However, we would appeal to States to ensure that their domestic authorities comply with their international obligations in that regard. Taking note of the contributions that have been made by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, we would underscore the importance of that Office. We regard its input as valuable, and we feel it is essential for the Committee to maintain dialogue with it. We pay tribute to Mrs. Mary Robinson for her contribution, and we would like to offer our support to the new High Commissioner, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, as he begins his work.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa15">My country has begun consultations with other United Nations Members so that we can produce a General Assembly resolution on human rights and terrorism to give States the guidance necessary to guarantee full respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa16">Regional cooperation plays a very important role, since convergences of interest and geographical proximity make regional organizations a natural front for action in the fight against terrorism. Here, we applaud the progress achieved within the Organization of American States.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa17">I wish to conclude by reaffirming Mexico's absolute readiness to continue to participate in, adopt and support practical measures, with a long-term vision that will make it possible to forge and consolidate a new concept of international cooperation to combat this scourge. Such a concept would have as a fundamental purpose addressing the roots and basic causes of hatred, frustration and violence.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Mexico for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lee</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">Let me begin, Sir, by congratulating you on your assumption of the presidency in what promises to be an eventful month. You have my delegation's full support. I also join others in thanking Ambassador Tafrov and his delegation for their achievements last month. And finally, we also thank the Secretary-General for joining us earlier and for his insightful statement.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">At the outset, I would like to say that my delegation associates itself fully with the statement to be made later by the Ambassador of the Republic of Cambodia on behalf of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">With the passing of the one-year anniversary of the 11 September attacks, it is timely for the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to switch on their critical thinking mode today to reflect on what we have accomplished and to look ahead to what we need to do in the war against terrorism. When the CTC was first set up exactly one year ago, the challenge given to it to spearhead the global campaign against terrorism looked insurmountable. Hence, by all measures, the Committee has done extremely well over the past year, given the resource and time constraints it faces. This remarkable feat could not have been accomplished without the brilliant leadership and passion of Ambassador Greenstock as Chairman. We would also like to thank the three Vice-Chairmen -- Ambassadors Valdivieso, Koonjul and Lavrov -- for their excellent chairmanship of the subcommittees.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">One year ago, they and the Chairman took up their appointments, probably appreciating the enormous burden but without knowing the extent of work involved. Thus, we find it truly admirable that at this time the Chairman and the three Vice-Chairmen have knowingly agreed to continue their terms for another six months. In case we do not have the opportunity of another public meeting on this matter before we leave the Council at the end of this year, we would like to pay special tribute to Ambassadors Valdivieso and Koonjul, who will also be leaving the Council at the end of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">We are also enormously grateful to the Counter-Terrorism Committee experts for their accomplishments in the onerous task of reviewing the voluminous tons of country reports. Some members of the original group of experts will be leaving the Committee soon, and we wish them all the best in their future endeavours. Next, the translators must also be commended. They have worked feverishly behind the scenes, and under great pressure, to translate 265 reports and countless attachments. The other members of the CTC should also be commended for their proactive participation in the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">Last, but not least, we also commend the CTC secretariat, an integral part of the Committee, whose members have borne their administrative duties admirably.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">While the CTC has made an immense contribution in its one-year of existence -- and Ambassador Greenstock has already given us the details of their work -- the war against terrorism is far from over. Terrorism still pervades every corner of the globe, and the battle against terrorism is a continuous and formidable task.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Underscoring the grim reminder that the threat to global security remains unabated, the United States marked the first anniversary of the 11 September attacks by being on the second highest "orange" alert, deploying anti-aircraft missiles around Washington and closing embassies across Asia. Americans kept on guard at home and abroad. Many other countries also adopted similar heightened security measures. Hence, we would like to pose three future challenges for the CTC to consider.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">First is the need to deepen cooperation and collaboration. Terrorism is like a raging fire. One cannot just stand by and watch while the fire consumes your neighbour's lands. If the fire is left uncontrolled, there is a strong chance that it may spread and engulf the surrounding areas, including your own land. Ambassador Greenstock has also underlined the importance of close collaboration by noting in his statement that the success of the global campaign against terrorism, spearheaded by the CTC, hinges critically on the cohesiveness of all Member States to demonstrate their collective will to implement sound measures to eradicate the scourges of international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">In this context, our Foreign Minister Jayakumar underscored, in his address to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session on 13 September 2002, that it is imperative to consider new ways to synergize the coordination between the United Nations, other regional and international organizations and Member States. Here we agree with our colleague from Colombia that there needs to be more collaboration between the CTC and the 1267 Sanctions Committee in order to address the gaps mentioned by him.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">Secondly, there is the need to let go of conventional paradigms. It is alarming that many of us still possess the conventional paradigms of terrorist organizations characterized by well-defined hierarchies, a specific political agenda and a conventional arsenal. The global indifference to the evolution which has taken place in terrorist networks and their modalities has prevented us from effectively thwarting terrorists. For example, when the Aum Shinrikyo cult attacked Tokyo's subway network with deadly sarin gas in March 1995, countries around the globe were gripped with shock and scrambled to ask themselves whether they were prepared to handle similar biological or chemical terrorist attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa12">When the world watched with disbelief and horror on 11 September last year, much of the shock had to do with the fact that commercial aircraft with ordinary civilians on board had been hijacked by Al-Qaeda terrorists and used as attack weapons. Only then did the rest of the world begin to grapple with the prospect of similar unconventional terrorist attacks on their own soil.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa13">These events were just two of the many that illustrate clearly that we should have no illusions about modern-day terrorism. Terrorist groups have gone through a privatization process by receiving private funding and training, and they have adapted to new technology and methods to become highly networked organizational structures which are much less visible but much more lethal. As the world is besieged with the internationalization of terrorism, it is critical for Member States to examine the current modalities and to institutionalize mechanisms to deepen the exchange of information between intelligence and law enforcement officers at the regional and international levels, thereby forming our own closely coordinated networks. It takes a network to beat a network.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa14">The third challenge is the need to increase technical assistance to Member States. Bearing in mind the first two challenges that we have outlined above, this third is the most crucial. We live in a globalized environment where terrorism can and will exploit the porous borders and international trade of goods and services for their heinous ends. Therefore, it makes a great deal of sense for the international community and the United Nations to put together an extensive mutual assistance programme to strengthen the capacity of those Member States that lack the resources or experience to deal with terrorism effectively. In particular, the CTC needs to have a clear plan of action to deal with those States that have not taken firm action to counter terrorism, as required by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We strongly urge the CTC to focus considerable attention on the development of full-fledged outreach programmes to galvanize international assistance to those States that need the necessary aid and support to strengthen their national capacities to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa15">Singapore is ready to stand with the rest of the international community against the threat of the globalization of terrorism. We recognize that it is difficult for any one country to fight terrorism alone. Furthermore, we are situated in a region that has been dubbed "the second front" in the war on terror. Consequently, we are committed to regional efforts to eradicate international terrorism and to the deepening of our exchanges with regional and international players. For example, Singapore, Japan and the Republic of Korea will be co-hosting an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum workshop on counter-terrorism and security issues in Tokyo next week. The other regional efforts, in which we continue to participate, will be outlined in the joint ASEAN statement that I referred to earlier, and I will not repeat them.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa16">Finally, I cannot overemphasize that the war against terrorism is a never-ending battle, with no guarantee of complete success. However, we have no choice but to work continuously, conscientiously and in partnership with others to combat international terrorism. We cannot afford to lose this war.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Singapore for the kind words addressed to me.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency and to assure you of my delegation's full support. I would also like to thank Ambassador Tafrov and his staff for the excellent presidency last month.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">Let me seize the opportunity to thank Ambassador Greenstock for his excellent leadership of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the remarkable achievements so far. Equally, I thank his staff, the Secretariat and the team of Committee experts. The tasks they perform greatly facilitate the effective and uniform implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by the Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">The Counter-Terrorism Committee has now been in operation for a year and is embarking on its fifth 90-day work programme. The Committee has received and managed to review an impressive number of implementation reports submitted by Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">However, while being mindful that there remains more to do before global standards against terrorism are uniform and fully implemented, we should not underestimate the significance of what has been achieved up to now. Information obtained so far suggests that terrorist groups are already finding it increasingly difficult to receive funding through international channels.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">Indeed, the Committee's emphasis on cooperation, dialogue, partnership and transparency seems to have paid dividends, as has the strategy of cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations on promulgating best practices, seeking synergies of approach and the provision of assistance to Member States requiring technical support.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">The legitimacy of and global adherence to the Committee's work is clearly demonstrated by the number of reports submitted to it. We look forward to reports by all Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">Dialogue and partnership is required in order to attain a broad follow-up of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. States must put in place national legislation that covers all aspects of the resolution and the appropriate executive instruments to go with it. This is no small task.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">International terrorism can be defeated only through a sustained and comprehensive approach that involves the active participation and collaboration of all Member States. International terrorism is a global threat. No State alone can protect itself from terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">Almost a year ago to the day, Norway adopted a provisional ordinance containing the necessary provisions to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. On 28 June 2002, a new bill entered into force in Norway that establishes effective and permanent legislative measures against acts of terrorism and the financing of terrorism. Other Norwegian legislation has been reviewed to ensure that the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> are fully met.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">The new legislation also fulfils the relevant requirements of the 9 December 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Norway ratified the Convention on 15 July this year. We have thereby joined the group of States that have ratified all 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">We are mindful of the technical difficulties that some Member States may have in implementing the legal and financial measures envisaged in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. This situation raises concerns that we must seek to reduce through positive and coordinated action. Our chain will not hold if it has weak links. It is essential that all Member States implement the same measures and observe the same standards. The establishment of the CTC has added extraordinary value to the universal implementation of the legal obligations of United Nations Member States in the fight against terrorism. We appreciate the efforts of the Committee to assist States in strengthening their capacity to fight terrorism by implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">Norway will act in support of the CTC and offer suitable programmes to assist States lacking capacity to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and to report to the Committee. We have submitted information to the CTC about available Norwegian experts in relevant fields and we are ready, within our resources, to assist countries that have requested help in their efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We are currently looking into how that commitment can be transformed into concrete assistance to States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa13">Norway attaches priority to cooperation with African countries in combating terrorism. We support the African Union's work towards effective and comprehensive implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by its Member States. Similarly, we are supporting a project aimed at strengthening the capacity of countries in the Southern African Development Community region to follow up the specific measures of this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa14">International terrorism is a threat to international peace and security. It undermines global stability and prosperity, threatens social and economic development and endangers and violates basic human security. Terrorism is, not least, a threat against human rights. There is no contradiction between the measures set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, on the one hand, and the protection of human rights, on the other. We wholeheartedly support the CTC's determination to remain in close contact with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello. The effective implementation of anti-terrorist measures at the national level should not be perceived by anyone as an excuse to disallow fundamental rights and freedoms. Upholding and reinforcing the rule of law must stand out as a centrepiece of our strategy to combat terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Norway for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, and the delegation of Cameroon on assuming the presidency of the Council for the month of October. May I also express our appreciation for the efficient presidency last month in the hands of Ambassador Tafrov and the delegation of Bulgaria. I also wish to thank the President for arranging today's public meeting of the Council on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">Ireland fully agrees with the statement that will be made shortly by Denmark on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">The work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, under the leadership of Ambassador Greenstock, has been remarkable. A year ago, the world saw what the forces of barbarism, if unchecked, will do in defiance of our vision. That vision has been embedded by the United Nations in laws and norms respecting human dignity and diversity. It is a vision of a common moral world where nations and people live by certain shared standards and ideals. Today we can say with reasonable confidence that such atavistic forces now face an international community acting in concert and in a common endeavour so as to deny them capacity to act or ever again to inflict such atrocities on our world.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">Ireland therefore pays warm tribute to what has been achieved by the Counter-Terrorism Committee in requiring and encouraging full implementation of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. That work has been done with patience, with openness and with a sense of realism and balance. We all accept that many of the requirements laid out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> cannot be fully achieved by every State overnight. For this reason, in the five 90-day programmes and in the responses to national reports, the Committee has rightly sought to encourage rather than admonish, and to foster cooperation and shared effort rather than finger-pointing. This is certainly the right approach.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">It is also right for us to be aware of the need for vigilance and caution in maintaining and strengthening our common values, even as we confront together those who seek to destroy or erode those values. We do ourselves no service unless we accept that terrorism flourishes all too easily where injustice also flourishes; or that the fight against international terrorism can all too easily be used to attack or criticise legitimate political dissent; or that a blanket approach of endorsing in the round every action taken by every Government under the rubric of fighting international terrorism would be a flawed approach. A year after the barbarism of 11 September, we need to always recall that the fabric of laws and codes that we have painstakingly built up over recent decades in the United Nations remains all too fragile and vulnerable. Rights lost in any country are not easily restored. Voices stifled can indeed be muted, but at a great cost. Values endangered are our common loss.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">Ireland warmly endorses the report of the Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorism. In terms of the future work of the CTC, we especially agree with the recommendation in the report that it should be ensured that expertise developed in the various United Nations system offices is made available to the CTC. We should, in the view of my delegation, pay strong attention to the views of human rights experts, including, of course, those of High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello, who is building on the work of his predecessor, Mary Robinson; but also those of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">Ireland fully supports the recommendations of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights contained in the note entitled "A human rights perspective on counter-terrorism measures".</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">I have focused on human rights aspects not because the Committee is at all unaware of that dimension, but because, as we assess future steps in strengthening international cooperation against terrorism, it seems to my delegation salutary to stand back and look at the landscape as a whole and to remember that our work here in the United Nations is about values of humanism and humanity.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">There are three particular achievements of the CTC in its first year that I want to emphasize.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">First, capacity-building among States must be strengthened so that the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> are translated into operational action, not just laws on the statute book. Secondly, the strengthening of regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism has been a signal achievement of the past year. Thirdly, the CTC has strongly focused on assistance to States requiring support and advice in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Ireland was pleased recently to submit details of Irish national experts for inclusion in the directory of assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">Today's debate is an opportunity to say "thank you and well done" to the CTC, to its Chairman, to the experts advising the CTC and to the Secretariat. This, on behalf of my delegation, I warmly do and wish the Committee every success in its future work on behalf of all of us.</p>

	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">The great importance of today's meeting is evident in its very long list of speakers. Given the great number of speakers, I shall be very brief, focusing on my evaluation of the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">The Chinese delegation thanks Ambassador Greenstock for his presentation on behalf of the CTC. We endorse his summary and assessment of the Committee's work to date. My delegation believes that, during the year since its establishment, the CTC has done a great deal of effective work. The first-stage review is essentially complete; the second-stage review is proceeding on schedule. The Committee's open and transparent working methods have been greatly appreciated by the vast majority of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">The CTC's success could not have been possible without the efforts of its Bureau, its members, the experts and the Secretariat. We agree with the fifth 90-day work programme and the focus of work of the second-stage review adopted by the Committee. We endorse the renewal of the Bureau's mandate for six months.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">Apart from the two priority areas defined by the CTC, we believe that the Committee should pay special attention during the second-stage review to the question of providing assistance to Member States in need of such assistance. In this regard, we call on the relevant donors actively to respond to the Committee's appeal and to cooperate with the CTC experts in providing assistance, in a timely and effective manner, to the countries that have requested it. Moreover, we also believe that, in its future work in the second stage, the CTC should continue its review of the national reports, in strict accordance with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, so as to enhance Member States' counter-terrorism capacity in the legislative and administrative fields as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">The work of the CTC to date has laid a good foundation for Member States' ability to suppress terrorism and for international cooperation in that regard. Meanwhile, we should also note that counter-terrorism capacity-building is a long-term process inseparable from international counter-terrorism practice. The issue of how to integrate United Nations counter-terrorism efforts into international counter-terrorism practice requires the Council's attention.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk03-pa01">I thank the representative of China for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rostow</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa01">A year ago, the abominable terrorist attacks of 11 September compelled the international community to take a stand in defence of the shared values embodied in the United Nations Charter. The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the ensuing work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) represent a chapter in the history of the Security Council and the United Nations in which we can take pride together, while forever recalling the mortal menace and cruelty that have spurred our collective action. The efforts of the CTC are an essential front in our common fight.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa02">By now, all are familiar with the series of binding obligations that this resolution imposes on each and every Member State. Moreover, the establishment of the CTC through operative paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> will have an enduring resonance and significance. I might add that one should reflect on where we would be today had the CTC not been created. We would be way behind in the fight against terrorism and in the effort to improve the world's capacity to conduct counter-terrorism operations and to protect every nation State against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa03">Last September, during the drafting and negotiation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, my delegation admitted to scepticism at the intent to create a body to monitor its implementation. However, as my remarks just indicated, that scepticism has long since vanished. The achievements of the CTC in this first year would not have been possible without the contributions of the people who stand behind it. First and foremost, of course, the United States would like to commend Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his vigorous and committed leadership of the CTC. We would also like to thank the dedicated team of the United Kingdom mission -- Anna Clunes, Dominic Fortescue, Juliet Gilbert, Iain MacLeod and Karen Williams -- for their hard work in support of Ambassador Greenstock's efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa04">Secondly, we commend the three Vice-Chairmen -- the Ambassadors of Colombia, Mauritius and Russia -- for their, and their staffs', tireless efforts in making sure that the three subcommittees conducted their work in an efficient and professional manner and, indeed, in making the innovation of creating the subcommittees such a success. Thirdly, we would like to acknowledge the important contributions made by the dedicated team of CTC experts. Without their cooperation and skill, the CTC could not have reviewed and responded to the over 200 reports it has so far received.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa05">Finally, I would like to extend our congratulations to and acknowledgement of the important contribution of the Secretariat in support of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa06">Ambassador Greenstock has insisted on serious and energetic implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and on monitoring by the CTC. He has been imaginative and effective both in building and maintaining consensus within the CTC and among the United Nations membership. Indeed, in this work, he has set an example which others might follow, to the general benefit of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa07">Effective counter-terrorism requires international cooperation. There is simply no substitute for it, and the CTC has encouraged this cooperation. Effective counter-terrorism is also an effort to vindicate and defend the rule of law. The effective protection of human rights is always the defence of the rule of law. Terrorists and their supporters are enemies of the rule of law and we must not have any confusion on that point. The core of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is an obligation on all States to strengthen their legal institutions and capacities to combat terrorism. In that respect, there is no incompatibility between this effort and developing the rule of law and, therefore, the protection of basic human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa08">We believe that the priorities of the CTC for the next period, as set forth by Ambassador Greenstock and endorsed by the Committee, are sound and provide good guidance for the future work of the Committee, but they are based on the achievements of the Committee in its first year. The first achievement is the substantial number of States revising or upgrading their laws to fall in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Secondly, the Committee has helped accelerate the pace of ratification of the 12 international terrorism conventions and protocols, particularly the conventions on terrorist bombings and on the financing of terrorism. Finally, a wide array of international institutions and regional and subregional organizations have joined the CTC in the effort to enhance and speed up implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. In the view of the CTC, that is an indispensable partnership.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa09">Another critical aspect of the CTC's work this past year -- and it will be in the future -- has been its efforts to facilitate the provision of technical assistance to those States lacking capacity. That effort has included the creation of what will be a comprehensive dictionary or database of technical-assistance providers and an ongoing effort to facilitate the link-up between States requiring assistance and States willing to provide assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa10">As the CTC begins its second year of work, it should continue to approach its task with the same level of urgency and enthusiasm that has characterized its work over the past year. We also urge all Member States to continue to cooperate with the CTC and to implement their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> with a sense of urgency. It cannot be stated often enough that the threat of terrorist attack is still with us at all times.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk04-pa11">For my country, the one-year anniversary of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is, and forever shall be, bound to the events of 11 September 2001, when nearly 3,000 persons from over 90 countries lost their lives in the attacks we all remember. It is important that the United Nations has taken key steps in this struggle against terrorism, and will in the future, by strengthening international standards and norms through <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the work of the CTC, and by striking to cut off the financial lifeblood of terrorists through <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(2000).pdf" class="nolink">resolutions 1267 (2000)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1390(2002).pdf" class="pdf">1390 (2002)</a>. The United Nations and this institution have shown their capacity for important ongoing and indispensable effort on behalf of the international community as a whole.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Karev</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">Allow me, at the outset, to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the Council presidency and to wish you success in your work. I also express our gratitude to your predecessor, Ambassador Tafrov, for his successful guidance of the work of the Council in September. We are also grateful to the Secretary-General for his important statement made today in the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">In the first year of its existence, the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) has proven itself to be a reliable and key link in the emerging system designed to counter new threats and challenges. We are grateful to the Chairman of the Committee for his comprehensive briefing on the achievements of the body he has headed in its first year. We view positively the results of the Committee's work and the positive momentum of its ongoing activity. Everyone is well aware that most of the credit for that goes to Ambassador Greenstock personally and to his team. We must also mention the heroic work of the Secretariat staff and the Committee experts. We express our heartfelt gratitude to them, and we sincerely regret that we must part now with three experts, who are leaving the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">Due in large part to the dynamic work of the CTC, we are witnessing a process to establish, under the auspices of the United Nations, an unparalleled global structure to counteract the threat of terrorism. The Committee must play a pivotal role in ensuring that it speaks in a single voice and eliminates potentially weak links. In that context, of great importance is the organic linkage of the main areas of activity, an objective analysis of anti-terrorist measures adopted by various countries, and the establishment of a system designed to provide advisory and technical assistance to States so that they can implement their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">We believe that the Committee's intention is correct with regard to placing special emphasis, in its future work, on interaction with regional and subregional organizations in the anti-terrorist domain. It is likely that the interaction between the CTC, the Anti-terrorist Centre of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the regional anti-terrorist structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will yield promising results.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa05">We support the recently approved CTC programme of work for its fifth 90-day period. Concluding consideration of the second round of States' reports on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by the end of this year seems to us an ambitious objective. Achieving that will allow the Committee to compile a detailed atlas of vulnerable places and to concentrate on providing assistance to countries that need it.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa06">In that connection, it is important to maintain a balance between determining ways and means that the CTC will use and making recommendations to eliminate weaknesses that have been identified. The general view asserted in the Council that the CTC is not a punitive body and that it will adhere strictly to its agreed mandate is crucially important to the effectiveness of those efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa07">In the Counter-Terrorism Committee we are fully aware of the Security Council's readiness and ability to exercise its Charter authority to protect international peace and security in the face of the threat of terrorism. The Russian Federation will continue to make all efforts necessary to ensure that the activity of the CTC is effective and constructive.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa08">In conclusion, regarding the Council's activity in the area of anti-terrorism generally, we wish to note that the Council must redouble its efforts to help States implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1390(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1390 (2002)</a>, which provides for a wide range of measures against international terrorists and their sponsors. We have serious concerns regarding the fact that, as of the end of September of this year, only 70 Member States had reported on their steps to implement that resolution, even though all the reports should have been submitted to the Council in April. The situation with regard to reports submitted to the CTC is preferable.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for this kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa01">We wish to express our best wishes at the beginning of a month that is very important to the Security Council regarding international peace and security. We have full confidence in you, Mr. President, and in your team.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa02">France would like to associate itself in advance with the statement to be delivered on behalf of the European Union by the Permanent Representative of Denmark.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa03">In my national capacity, I would like to begin by expressing my warmest congratulations and our gratitude, first, to Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, and next, to all those who work with him in the British Mission and to the Vice-Chairmen who support him. Nor can I fail to mention the Committee's independent experts. They have all done an absolutely remarkable job.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa04">A year has passed. Now, together, we assess the road that we have travelled. Historic in many aspects, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> remains central in the determined efforts of the international community to combat the scourge of terrorism. We owe that success in large part to the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Without that organ for regular monitoring of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, what would have happened to the effective implementation of the resolution?</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa05">Innovative in many regards -- especially because of the transparency of its work, which is often mentioned as a model to be emulated -- the Committee has so far completely fulfilled the mission entrusted to it. We need only mention the unprecedented number of national initial and follow-up reports submitted to the Committee, as well as the evaluation letters which the Committee has provided them in return. We should also mention the significant number of States that in recent months have become parties to several international conventions and protocols suppressing certain terrorist acts, in particular, the 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa06">This work has made it possible to take a truly global inventory of the legislative and administrative measures adopted by States in the multifaceted area of the fight against international terrorism. Crucial as it may be, that inventory is, however, only an initial step. First, all States without exception must send a report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Those that have not yet done so are urgently requested to do so quickly.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa07">Secondly, the adoption in every country of legislation and administrative measures designed to combat international terrorism in all of its aspects, in particular the major aspect of the fight to suppress its financing, is an ongoing process that needs to be supplemented and adapted as needed.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa08">Finally, we must ensure that the provisions adopted will be effectively implemented in practice. That requires, among other things, appropriate administrative measures and structures.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa09">The work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee is thus far from finished. As indicated by its work programme for the remainder of the year, the Committee must simultaneously continue the evaluation of the reports and follow-up reports that it receives by carrying out a nuanced review of the reports according to the priorities that it has established. In the opinion of my delegation, that review must also take into greater account the compatibility of legislation that has been adopted with the administrative and other structures that have been put in place, in order to make possible the most effective implementation possible.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa10">We must enhance the Committee's action in facilitating the provision of the technical assistance that is requested or that is considered by the Committee to be necessary or even a priority. Here, it must be very clear that it is not the duty of the Committee itself to provide that assistance. It must simply carry out a better assessment of the requests for assistance brought to its attention and must help to put those requesting assistance in contact with those who have made offers in the relevant areas. In that respect, the directory of technical assistance is an important tool; more States and international and regional organizations that can provide technical assistance in the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> should participate in the directory.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa11">Finally, we must continue to maintain close relations with international and regional organizations that have capabilities in the area of fighting terrorism. That cooperation must not only aim at avoiding needless duplication of activities or means but must also contribute to better cohesion in the efforts to fight terrorism in a given region.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk03-pa12">In order to successfully carry out all those tasks, the Counter-Terrorism Committee must be able to count on full cooperation from all. France, for its part, will continue to cooperate with the Committee at the national level and within the European Union. And it will do so with determination.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of France for his kind words addressed to the delegation of Cameroon and to the presidency.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Cameroon.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">Today's discussion of the results achieved by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism one year after the Committee's creation, attests to our refusal to yield.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">Humankind, thirsting for the culture of civilization, solidarity and social justice, had just celebrated in a spirit of enthusiasm and joyfulness its entry into the third millennium. We all thought that a new era had been born, one free of everything that had endangered the future and the hopes of humankind.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">On 11 September 2001, in the space of an hour, we were awakened by brutal reality and the horror of a new transborder and transterritorial curse: terrorism. We were shown proof that hatred, the cause of the crimes and the wars of the twentieth century, had not disappeared: racial hatred, ethnic hatred, religious and political hatred, hatred of others, hatred of foreigners. It is that hatred which shaped and nourished the terrorism that emerged on 11 September, a terrorism of a new type. It is new in terms of its global scope, its intolerance and its cowardice. The revolutionary and the anarchist of yesterday or the resistance fighter from the Second World War spared children and civilians. The terrorist of today attacks society itself. With utter and indiscriminate folly he strikes children, the aged, men and women, rich and poor, believers and non-believers without any distinction whatsoever. Such terrorism cannot be justified by anything, neither as means nor as an end.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa06">The terrorism of 11 September 2001 was also motivated by the will to force itself on others, and to force them to do its will, a will to impose its own law on people, communities and countries through humiliation and by causing crowds and individuals to tremble in fear of that unknown.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">Finally, the terrorist who showed his face on 11 September is, despite external appearances, a coward who dons a mask to make his move, then fades, disappears and sinks into anonymity. He is a coward, for, even if he is willing to die, he does so in order to more effectively kill men, women and children who have done nothing to him and whom he does not even know. That is the terrorist who emerged on 11 September.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa08">Those who train the terrorist, educate him, urge him on, give him shelter and provide him with the means to perpetrate his acts are all equally guilty. Giving in to that terrorist means giving up and abdicating our national sovereignty as States. It means abdicating our ethics, our awareness as human beings.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa09">It is that refusal to yield that underlies the vast process of mobilizing our energies begun by the United Nations the day after 11 September 2001 and that underlies <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa10">Cameroon remains fully committed to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, welcomes the largely positive results of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and we wish to renew our backing and support.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa11">My country wishes to pay well-deserved tribute to the CTC's Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his commitment, his creative imagination, his enthusiasm and his impartiality. Cameroon also wishes to welcome and congratulate the chairmen of the three subcommittees.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa12">Finally, Cameroon commends those States involved in the anti-terrorist struggle. We call for all States to adhere to the twelve international conventions against terrorism. We express a heartfelt call for specific international cooperation to strengthen the national capacities of those States which are in need of this.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa01">I am very grateful to members of the Council for their remarks this morning, and particularly for their universal support for the CTC, its work programme so far, its achievements and its indications of future direction.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa02">I want to comment briefly on some of the things that have been said and hope that some things said this morning will be picked up reactively by some of our speakers this afternoon.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa03">The Ambassador of Colombia was correct to give a critical appreciation of the work of the Committee so far and to point, not least, to some of the risks we face if we do not adapt as we go on. He was correct to say that, if we focus only on reports, the momentum behind the reports exercise risks fading if it does not lead on to other things. He coupled with that the need to consider very carefully how we should move from bureaucracy to action, and perhaps look at casework in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa04">I would like to give notice through the Council to members of the CTC that I think we should discuss this quite soon in the next season. We are never going to become a tribunal. I will certainly not preside over a committee that does that. But it is going to become increasingly necessary to deal with the gaps that we and our experts perceive in the capabilities of Member States to deal with terrorism in their jurisdictions and to try and work with them to meet those gaps, particularly where there is a real life vulnerability or a real life likelihood that those gaps will make it easier for terrorists to actually operate. I think that is an area which is relevant to the kind of gentle warning made in Colombia's presentation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa05">I also take careful note of his suggestion, as others have done, that we need to improve cooperation or perhaps, to put it better, the operational linkage between the work of the CTC and the work of the Sanctions Committee on Afghanistan. I shall certainly bring that up for discussion within the Committee before Ambassador Valdivieso leaves the Vice-Chairmanship.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa06">I want to pick up one comment from the Ambassador of Mexico, his observation that uniformity and complementarity in the international system are beginning to take a grip. We do not mean uniformity in the sense that we must all do everything the same way, because national politics, jurisdictions, legislative and other Government machineries are different, and cultures are different, but uniformity in the objective and in the determination is extraordinarily important. This is something to which the CTC has been able to contribute over the past year. Complementarity in the way in which we fill gaps and raise capacities is absolutely vital. This is why I have placed so much emphasis on the work of the regional and subregional organizations -- because like-minded States have to work together on this and encourage and help each other, since they are collective neighbourhoods protecting the whole neighbourhood. That sense of complementarity is a very useful theme which we should keep in mind as we go along.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa07">I appreciated hearing several Council members mention human rights in some detail. This is a sensitive subject both for the CTC and the Council, but the awareness of the CTC to human rights obligations must be very active, not just passive. I think Mexico, Ireland and the United States particularly focused on this, and reminded us that what we are promoting in the CTC must be actively compatible with human rights obligations, leading to greater opportunities for Member States to meet their human rights obligations against the tension of the requirement to meet obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Here -- and this is particularly relevant in this area, although it applies more generally -- I would like to pay tribute to the work of the legal advisers of delegations in the Committee. Some of them actually sit on the Committee as their national representatives there, but all the legal advisers have played a very important role, not just in advising us on what the law requires -- what <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> says, and where we should be going in the legislative part of our programme -- but also in directing us in that rather difficult area between politics and law, both domestic and international, which all members of the Council from time to time have to get right. In this respect, I would like to thank my own legal adviser, Iain MacLeod, who has been a tower of strength to me across the board.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa08">Finally, the representative of Singapore mentioned three challenges, two of which I want to comment on. First of all, "new ways to synergize coordination" (<i>supra</i>) must not be just a rhetorical phrase. Energy must be put into the business of technical assistance and cooperation. I think that we are beginning to do that, but I am not yet satisfied that we have linked up with the international organizations that are leading in this field, to make them aware of what the CTC has to do and what it has the power to do, and of what they are doing. That is another theme for this upcoming season which I want to get right and to which the Committee will need to give some thought.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa09">Secondly, and most interestingly, I thought that Ms. Lee was right to advise us to beware of sticking only to conventional paradigms. Many articles have been written recently on asymmetrical warfare. Terrorism is one of the instruments of asymmetrical warfare -- that is warfare by small groups against large States, warfare in unconventional ways, and the delivery of unconventional attacks against established States and established governmental institutions. The CTC, while dealing with an asymmetrical threat, is trying to establish a symmetrical response. That does not mean to say that we are being conventional, but we have to be aware that in producing a collective, governmental, symmetrical and in many ways defence-oriented response -- defence understood in its widest sense, not just physical but also metaphorical -- we have to be aware that we are dealing with a nasty asymmetrical enemy. That too is something on which I would quite like to have some expert briefing of the Committee in the months to come.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk03-pa10">I will be available this afternoon to respond to comments from non-members of the Council. But I would like to draw the attention of the United Nations to the leaflet on the CTC that we have produced, which is available in and around this Chamber, for Member States, members of the Council and those outside to use in reminding their Governments of the facts behind the CTC -- what it is doing and what it intends to do -- in an easily digestible form. I urge everyone: please use it, distribute it and keep up the good work.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Naidu</span> <span class="nation">Fiji</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">My delegation warmly congratulates you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">It is my honour to address the Security Council on behalf of the group of countries members of the Pacific Islands Forum that maintain permanent missions in New York: Australia, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, Fiji.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">Since the last time a statement was made in the Security Council on the issue of terrorism by the States members of the Pacific Islands Forum group, we have continued to work individually and collectively to combat terrorism in our region. Our resolve to continue doing so was embodied in the Nasonini Declaration on regional security, which our 16 leaders issued in August this year. The Declaration, which is being issued in <a href="../pdf/A-57-331.pdf" class="pdf">document A/57/331</a>, affirmed our common commitment to cooperation on law enforcement, based on a strong legislative foundation, as a key element in addressing the threat of terrorism and transnational crime; it stressed our region's commitment to global counter-terrorism efforts, including through the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF) special recommendations, including associated reporting requirements; and it underlined the importance of introducing legislation and developing national strategies to combat serious crime, including terrorist financing and terrorism, money laundering, drug trafficking and the smuggling of and trafficking in people.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">The fight against terrorism cannot be won with statements of intent. It needs concrete and practical cooperation, and it needs the continuous enhancement of capacity to take action. In our region we have focused both on practical cooperation and on capacity-building. The former takes place through a number of coordination and information-sharing mechanisms, including in relation to police and law enforcement, immigration and customs and weapons controls. Those efforts are continuing to be refined and developed.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Capacity limitations present a major challenge to many of our members. Several are in dialogue with the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), and with Ambassador Ward in particular, but we are also looking at what more can be done regionally and bilaterally. Forum leaders have endorsed the establishment of an expert working group to coordinate the development of a regional framework to address terrorism and transnational crime, and have asked that the group report to the Forum's 2003 meeting and review regional implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and the FATF special recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Leaders also recognized that further urgent action was needed on the part of some members. Officials are working on a strategy to address these subjects. They are looking at, among other things, the vulnerability of banking and financial systems and transport infrastructure, particularly international airports. Forum island countries with a capacity to assist others recognize their special responsibilities in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">Much has been achieved over the past year in putting in place the legislative, regulatory and administrative framework for combating terrorism. The CTC, under the exemplary leadership of Ambassador Greenstock, can rightly take much credit for that. But there is no room for complacency; our efforts remain a work in progress. We in the Pacific recognize that there can be no standing still in the fight against terrorism. No region is truly pacific when it comes to the threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">As we face the evolving challenge of terrorism, and as we work to implement the letter and the spirit of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the Security Council can be assured of the fullest support of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum group.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zarif</span> <span class="nation">Iran</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and also to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Tafrov of Bulgaria. I wish especially to thank the Secretary-General for his thoughtful and far-sighted remarks to the Council earlier this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">I would also like to thank Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his excellent work as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) and for his comprehensive briefing today. My thanks go also to the three Vice-Chairmen of the Committee and to all its members and experts for their dedicated efforts to implement the tasks assigned to the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">The fight against terrorism remains a priority for the international community. We have all emphasized the central role of the United Nations, and we thus acknowledge the important contribution of the CTC during the first year of its work. I would like to reaffirm that my Government is fully committed to cooperate with the Committee and, in that context, is in the process of finalizing its second report to the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">Here, I wish to cite briefly a number of areas where we have undertaken new measures. First, a national coordination committee has been established to facilitate the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Secondly, we have augmented and intensified the practical arrangements to ensure, among other things, the safety and security of civil aviation; increased security at the borders with a view to preventing the entry of terrorists into our territory; and enhanced the anti-money-laundering mechanisms in the banking system. Thirdly, the forces at our 900-kilometre border with Afghanistan have been increased in order to identify and to arrest individuals suspected of being involved in terrorist activities. Simultaneously, several large-scale operations to locate and remove "safe houses" in the eastern provinces have been carried out. As a result, some 150 suspected individuals of many nationalities have been arrested and handed over to the authorities of their respective countries. Fourthly, a thorough study of existing national laws has been carried out, with a view to ascertaining whether the terrorist acts mentioned in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> are crimes under our domestic laws. While many existing laws make terrorist acts punishable, a comprehensive law on combating terrorism is in preparation and will be submitted to our Parliament in due course. Fifthly, bilateral arrangements have been made with a number of neighbouring countries, as well as with countries from other regions, to deal with security matters and to coordinate counter-terrorism measures.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">The heinous terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 created unprecedented global momentum to join forces under the umbrella of the United Nations in order to eradicate the menace of terrorism and to prevent the recurrence of similar attacks against innocent civilians. The CTC, which is an embodiment of such a United Nations-led multilateral coalition against terrorism, is doing a commendable job. Yet an opposing unilateralist trend is on the rise that runs the risk of arresting the momentum of that effort and by shattering the universal consensus, undermining the overall effective fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">We expected that the 11 September events would lead to more understanding of the imperative of a fresh and more nuanced approach to security -- a value that is indivisible and cannot be achieved at the expense of others or through military might alone. Regrettably, that expectation has yet to be realized. Moreover, a year after the start of a new round of the war on terrorism, the war faces the risk of being hijacked and diverted towards other ends.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">There is no doubt that terrorism is a crime. However, oversimplifying terrorism without objectively addressing the issue in its entirety does a disservice to the cause of combating terrorism. Contemporary history clearly demonstrates that terrorist acts have roots in political issues, which neither justifies the acts of its perpetrators nor necessarily demonizes the cause they may embrace. However, it cannot be denied that almost all terrorist activities either directly originate from a conflict situation or draw strength and recruits from it. Terrorism is a response -- however perverted and barbaric -- to injustice, exclusion and frustration arising from powerlessness. We regret that there is a remarkable inclination to overlook these more complex historical and political dimensions and motivations, which provide a fertile ground for terrorist activities. We believe that, while efforts to combat terrorism and to deprive it from funding and other support should continue, it is also necessary to focus on the situations that bring it about and sustain it. To do otherwise would amount to cutting off its limbs and leaving its roots intact.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">There should be no doubt that efforts aimed at hijacking the fight against terrorism and using it as a means to suppress people and to repress their national aspirations would lead to a decline in international support for that fight. As a result, the international coalition, which is indispensable for fighting terrorism, would fall apart. Employing the fight against terrorism as a means to bring pressure to bear on States that may pursue a different political outlook is yet another danger that threatens its integrity and support base.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa09">The decisive stage in the war against terrorism is capturing the minds and hearts of peoples. Thus, the abuse of the fight against terrorism by demagogues to spread hatred and bigotry among various cultures and religions may in fact prove to be no less serious in its consequences than terrorism itself. The international community, and indeed the Council, need to analyse the problem and to articulate and develop effective mechanisms to arrest this ever-growing threat to international security. Engaging in more sober reflection, soul-searching and constructive dialogue and less rhetoric, agitation and incitement is probably the only credible way to ensure cooperation at the international level -- a global coalition for peace -- thus rendering the global environment less conducive to terrorism. Undoubtedly, such an environment is a sine qua non for the success of the CTC.</p>
