	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq announcement of 10 February 2006 of the certified election results for the Iraqi Council of Representatives. The Security Council is particularly encouraged that political parties representing all of Iraq's communities participated in the election, demonstrated by the high voter turnout across Iraq. The Council commends and congratulates the people of Iraq for demonstrating their commitment to a peaceful, democratic political process, and for having braved difficult conditions and the threat of violence to cast their votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council stresses the importance of inclusiveness, national dialogue and unity as Iraq's political development moves forward. The Council calls on Iraq's political leaders to work with resolve towards the formation of a fully inclusive Government, which will strive to build a peaceful, prosperous, democratic and united Iraq. The Council urges that all Iraqis participate in the peaceful political process and calls upon those who continue to use violence to lay down their arms. The Security Council unanimously condemns acts of terrorism in Iraq. Such acts should not be allowed to disrupt Iraq's political and economic progress.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council gives special recognition to the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq for its role in organizing and administering the elections. The Council also commends the Secretary-General and the United Nations in successfully assisting election preparations, and notes in particular the role of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). The Security Council also appreciates the assistance given by other international actors, including European Union electoral experts and the International Mission for Iraqi Elections (IMIE).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council underlines the need for continued and enhanced international support from all States and relevant international organizations to assist Iraq's wide-ranging political, economic and social development. The Council calls on the United Nations to play the fullest possible role in Iraq. It also calls on all other international actors, particularly Iraq's neighbours, to conform to relevant Security Council resolutions and consider also how they can reinforce their contribution at this important time. In this context, the Council also looks forward to the continued efforts of the League of Arab States in support of the political process endorsed in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1546 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1637(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1637 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its support for a federal, democratic, pluralist and unified Iraq, in which there is full respect for human rights."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-8.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/8</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
