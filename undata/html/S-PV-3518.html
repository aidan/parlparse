	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the second progress report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), <a href="../pdf/S-1995-274.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/274</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have also received photocopies of a letter dated 13 April 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, which will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-1995-296.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/296</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council has considered the Secretary-General's progress report of 7 April 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-274.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/274</a>) on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the confirmation by the Secretary-General that the cease-fire is generally holding and that the level of cease-fire violations has remained relatively low. It also welcomes the continued deployment of UNAVEM III military and police observers to team sites and regional headquarters outside Luanda, and the progress reported by him in a number of important areas, including liaison with UNITA, the completion of the first phase of disengagement, discussions of the modalities for the incorporation of UNITA into the national army. It commends the parties for their efforts in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council notes that a number of developments give cause for concern. These include reports of continuing military actions and preparations, in particular the attack on the airstrip at Andulo by the Angolan air force, the failure to complete the second phase of disengagement by 10 April 1995, some restrictions on UNAVEM III's access to Government military facilities, and recent attacks on the personnel of UNAVEM III and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It welcomes the improved access by UNAVEM III to UNITA-controlled areas but notes that some local UNITA commanders continue to impose restrictions on the movement of UNAVEM III personnel and calls upon UNITA to ensure unrestricted access.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council calls on the parties to cooperate fully with the United Nations, in particular through the Joint Commission, and to ensure the safety of the personnel of UNAVEM III and the NGOs. It notes with satisfaction that the members of the Joint Commission, including representatives of the Government of Angola, met Dr. Savimbi in Bailundo on 7 April and that at that meeting he publicly confirmed his commitment to the Lusaka Protocol. It reiterates its call for a meeting between President dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi as a matter of urgency because such a meeting may help to improve the climate of trust and give new impetus to the peace process in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's decision to proceed with preparations for the deployment of UNAVEM III's infantry units (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-230.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/230</a>). It notes that he has reminded the Angolan parties that they must implement without delay the requirements of the Lusaka Protocol, provide UNAVEM III with the indispensable logistic support, and undertake essential tasks such as mine clearance, the repair of major transport routes, and the designation of quartering areas, to make it possible for United Nations infantry battalions to deploy to Angola in May 1995. The Council fully supports the Secretary-General in this regard and emphasizes the need for full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. It welcomes his intention to deploy the infantry battalions in stages. It stresses the importance it attaches to the Government of Angola providing the logistic support envisaged for UNAVEM III. In this context it welcomes the Government of Angola's agreement to allow the United Nations full operational access to Catumbela airfield and calls upon the Government of Angola to ensure that this arrangement is extended for as long as required by UNAVEM III. It also welcomes the Government of Angola's intention to conclude, by 15 April 1995, a Status of Forces Agreement with the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council reaffirms the obligation of all States to implement fully the provisions of paragraph 19 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-864(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 864 (1993)</a> and states that the continuing flow of arms into Angola contrary to the provisions of the Acordos de Paz' and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-976(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 976 (1995)</a> contributes to the country's instability and undermines efforts at confidence-building.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council is encouraged that the Secretary-General has been able to report overall progress in the humanitarian situation in the month since his last report to the Council. It calls upon the parties to continue to facilitate access to all areas of the country for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. It also calls once again upon the parties to respect the safety and security of all humanitarian personnel in Angola. It endorses the call on the parties by the three observer States to the Angolan peace process (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-239.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/239</a>) to cooperate fully in releasing all war-related detainees through the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as all captured foreign citizens, or to provide information about their fate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"While the Security Council takes note of the progress made in the implementation of the comprehensive mine action programme, it also notes the statement in the Secretary-General's report that the mine situation in Angola remains critical. The Council therefore urges both parties to support and facilitate mine clearance and to comply fully with the relevant provisions of the Lusaka Protocol. In this context, it welcomes the statement by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, following the 13th meeting of the Joint Commission, that the Government of Angola and UNITA have pledged to put 800 and 400 personnel, respectively, at the disposal of UNAVEM III for mine clearance activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council will continue to monitor the situation in Angola closely. It looks forward to the next monthly report of the Secretary-General and requests him, in the meantime, to ensure that it is kept informed of developments in Angola and on prospects for the prompt deployment of the infantry battalions of UNAVEM III."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-18.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/18</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
