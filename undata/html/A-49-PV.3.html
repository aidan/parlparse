	<p id="pg005-bk10-pa01">I wish to draw the attention of members to the Summary of Scheduled Meetings in today's <i>Journal</i>. In Section IV of the summary of the 1st meeting of the General Committee, &quot;Adoption of the agenda&quot;, the last paragraph of the text under item 153 should be deleted. That modification applies to all official languages.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk10-pa02">In respect of paragraph 42, therefore, the General Committee decided not to recommend the inclusion of item 153 of the draft agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk10-pa03">We turn now to the agenda which the General Committee recommends for adoption by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk10-pa04">In accordance with past practice, we shall follow the numbering given in paragraph 43 of the General Committee's report (<a href="../pdf/A-49-250.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/250</a>) and, where it seems appropriate, we shall consider items in groups. I should like to remind members once again that at present we are not discussing the substance of any item, except when such discussion can assist the Assembly in deciding whether or not to include an item in the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk10-pa05">Items 1 to 6 have already been dealt with.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk10-pa06">We turn to items 7 to 25. May I remind members that we are dealing only with the question of the inclusion of the items.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Giovas</span> <span class="nation">Greece</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk25-pa01">Greece has repeatedly stated its concern on the situation in the territories of Croatia under temporary United Nations protection. As a country of the region, both in our national capacity and as a member of the European Union, we have made every possible effort, and will continue to do so, in order to convince the parties involved of the need to achieve a <i>modus vivendi </i>in those areas.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk25-pa02">In this context, we are aware of the reasons for which the Croatian Government has asked for the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the General Assembly. However, we share the strong reservations expressed during the meeting of the General Committee by some of its members on the title of the item, since it could prove to be inflammatory at a highly sensitive stage of the peace process in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk25-pa03">We are confident that the Croatian delegation has duly taken note of those reservations and we hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly on this item will be non-confrontational and constructive.</p>

Only two plenary meetings were envisaged by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-47-237.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 47/237</a>, but I have been informed that a considerable number of Members have expressed interest in participating in these meetings and that therefore two meetings might be insufficient.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk15-pa02">In the light of such information, I should like to request representatives who wish to speak to inscribe their names in the list of speakers as soon as possible so that we can plan how best to organize those meetings and avoid very late hours.
