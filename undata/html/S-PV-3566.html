<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lukabu Khabouji N'Zaji</span> <span class="nation">Zaire</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">It is a pleasure for me and my delegation, Sir, to see you presiding over the work of the Security Council this month. We know your ability, and we know that the Council is in good hands.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">As the Council considers a draft resolution by which it would lift the embargo on the supply of arms to Rwanda, I wish to convey Zaire's gratitude to Council members, who have worked tirelessly to improve the text that was initially proposed. At the same time, we must stress that the compromise text of the draft resolution on lifting the embargo on the supply of arms and related matériel to Rwanda, which the Council is soon to adopt, although it has indeed taken into account some aspects of Zaire's position, falls far short of our expectations, given the deterioration of the situation and the exacerbation of tension in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">By suspending the embargo on the supply of arms to Rwanda for a trial period of one year, the Security Council would authorize Rwanda to obtain military equipment and other modern, sophisticated war matériel at a time when it is barely concealing its warlike intentions and when it is threatening to attack refugee camps in Zaire. It is also a time when Rwanda is not promoting a climate of understanding and national reconciliation, but, rather, is encouraging new flows of refugees to Zaire, which has the appearance of the expulsion of Rwanda's own nationals for political, ethnic and tribal reasons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">In other words, even though the Security Council has included conditions in this text, adoption of the draft resolution will not contribute to easing tension in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Facing this situation, Zaire is justified in derogating from the principle that refugees should not be subjected to measures such as refusal of entry at the border or, if they have already entered a territory where they seek asylum, expulsion or deportation to another State where they may be persecuted. Indeed, in accordance with article 3 of the General Assembly's Declaration on Territorial Asylum, of 14 December 1967, any State Member of the United Nations can derogate from the principles enunciated therein for overriding reasons of national security or in order to safeguard its population, as in the case of a mass influx of persons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Clearly, in this case Zaire intends to give the persons concerned the option of finding another host State.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">So far, out of solidarity and a sense of humanity, the Republic of Zaire has not wanted to resort to those provisions, convinced, on the one hand, that the United Nations and the international community would do everything possible to alleviate Zaire's burden and to facilitate the return of refugees to their countries of origin, and on the other hand, that the sister Rwandese Republic would assume in good faith its obligations under the tripartite agreement between Zaire, Rwanda and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the repatriation of Rwandan refugees, which was signed in Kinshasa on 21 October 1994. Unfortunately, this has not happened, and the Republic of Zaire cannot indefinitely sacrifice its own security for the sake of unilateral solidarity and humanitarianism, which could be suicidal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">That is why, as the Council is about to adopt the draft resolution before it, Zaire would like to draw the Council's and the international community's attention to the worsening of the situation on the eastern borders of our country. We would like the Security Council to address the situation. The Republic of Zaire would like to inform the Council here and now that if the situation should degenerate we will hold the Kigali Government and the Bujumbura Government responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">The Security Council should attach priority to the disarmament of the militias, of course, but we should bear in mind the recent massacre of a group of peaceful Italians. The Republic of Zaire wishes to take this opportunity to express its most heartfelt condolences to Italy over the loss of those peaceful people who were working for an organization with laudable goals and who were savagely massacred.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">I would like to ask the Security Council to bear in mind what I have said the next time it considers the situation in Rwanda and to take it to heart.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Zaire for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I hear no objection I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martínez Blanco</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">My delegation thanks the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), dated 8 August 1995, submitted pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-997(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 997 (1995)</a>. We consider the report positive. It shows that there have been improvements in the security situation; that the Government of Rwanda continues to take measures aimed at establishing the environment of confidence needed for the voluntary return of refugees in conditions of security and dignity; and that the Government also continues striving to strengthen the administration of justice, establish public order and promote national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Indeed, national reconciliation is a task that the Government of Rwanda must deal with as a priority. In the context of that task, it is undeniably important to strengthen the country's judicial system and simultaneously to adopt measures intended to promote human rights and to see that those rights are respected. This means the establishment of conditions that can produce the climate of confidence needed for the return of the refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">It is also satisfying to know that the maintenance of security in the country has improved and that the Government is now cooperating more closely with UNAMIR in the fulfilment of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">With regard to the task of national reconstruction, it is encouraging to know that the donor community and United Nations organs have met and have acknowledged the need to speed up the distribution of funds already committed for Rwanda. This would no doubt provide great support for the reconstruction of the country's infrastructure and for restoring and building up its national production capability.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Unfortunately, all the efforts made by the Government of Rwanda, with the assistance of the international community, to recover from the effects of the tragic events of 1994 could be thwarted by destabilization provoked from outside Rwanda -- with repercussions for neighbouring countries -- if there is no reduction in tensions and if lack of security persists in the parts of Zaire bordering Rwanda. These tensions exist because of reports of military training and weapons transfers to members of the former Government forces and militias that plan to attack the established Government. Therefore, the international community, which has been playing a leading role in the reconstruction of Rwanda and in the promotion of repatriation and reconciliation, must take measures such as the Government of Zaire; suggested establishment of an international commission to deal with reports of arms supplies to the forces of the former Rwandan Government.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">In general, my delegation is in agreement with the Secretary-General's observations and conclusions in his report. We support his initiatives to convene a regional conference to study the interrelated problems of peace, security and development in the Great Lakes subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">My delegation also believes that the draft resolution makes it possible for the Rwandan Government to address its internal-security problem, along with a number of related problems. It also provides a clear-cut monitoring mechanism for the restrictions imposed by paragraph 13 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, I wish to say that my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution because it contains the elements we believe essential for helping the people of Rwanda achieve peace, stability, confidence, reconstruction and the security the country needs.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nkgowe</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">It is a matter of public record that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 918 (1994)</a>, of 17 May 1994, was adopted at the height of one of the most tragic events in the history of Rwanda. The arms embargo was aimed at a Government which had planned, masterminded and presided over the mass execution of its own people. Today, the embargo is clearly applied not only against the wrong Government but against the one that has stopped the genocide.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The delegation of Botswana fully understands that, while it is true that the arms embargo now applies to a Government which committed no crime at all, it is equally true that the geopolitical and military situation in the Great Lakes subregion of Africa made it necessary for the Security Council to maintain the arms embargo for some time. There was no deliberate intention on the part of the Security Council to punish Rwanda or its new Government. The primary concern was to stem the flow of arms to a volatile subregion of Africa which could easily be engulfed by military conflict and thus threaten international peace and security. In our view, the arms embargo was also in the interests of the people of Rwanda, who needed relative peace and stability to re-establish their State institutions without the threat of war. However, recent developments have rendered the maintenance of the arms embargo politically untenable.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Elements of the former Rwanda armed forces have for some months now been engaged in military training and an arms build-up, in readiness for ultimately invading Rwanda. The Secretary-General's report submitted to the Council in June 1995 indicated that there was an increase in the militarization of the refugee camps and in cross-border incursions. These developments were of such a magnitude that the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-997(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 997 (1995)</a>, of 9 June 1995, in which it affirmed that the arms embargo applied to Rwandese nationals in neighbouring States as well. The Council also deemed it appropriate to request the Secretary-General to undertake consultations with neighbouring States to explore the possibility of deploying military observers in the airfields and other transportation routes. A solution has still to be found, as no agreement was reached on the deployment of the observers.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">The Security Council has repeatedly reminded the Government of Rwanda that it has primary responsibility to create conditions conducive to national reconciliation. This responsibility entails guaranteeing the security and safety of the people of Rwanda. The Council reaffirmed this primary responsibility of the Government of Rwanda in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-997(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 997 (1995)</a>. There can no longer be any justification for the continued denial to the Government of Rwanda of the wherewithal to defend itself and the people of Rwanda when a clear threat exists to the national security of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">Rwanda, like every other State, has the legitimate right of self-defence. We all know that no one would come to the defence of the people of Rwanda in the event of a determined offensive by elements of the forces of the former Rwandese Government. The Government of Rwanda continues to make concerted efforts to create a climate conducive to national healing and reconciliation, and we do not believe that elements of the former Government forces should be allowed to disrupt this process.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">The lifting of the arms embargo on Rwanda should not be misconstrued as licence for military preparations by anyone. This would be unacceptable as it would lead to an increase in tension and instability in the subregion. It is the hope of my delegation that the action of the Council will serve to deter those who committed genocide and who still entertain the idea of shooting their way back to Kigali to continue their despicable deeds. The international community should be united in its resolve to ensure that there will never be any repetition of the events which started in April 1994. The message to the Government of Rwanda is also loud and clear. Paragraph 6 of the draft resolution before us calls upon the Government to create conditions which will enable the over 2 million refugees to return in honour and dignity. The return of the refugees is at the heart of Rwanda's problems. The acquisition of defensive capability is only a temporary measure. The real solution will come with the return of the refugees, national reconciliation and durable peace in the country, and we encourage the continued efforts of the Government of Rwanda in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">My delegation attaches the utmost importance to the political and diplomatic efforts aimed at finding solutions to the problems facing Rwanda and the States of the Great Lakes subregion. Operative paragraph 5 correctly requests the Secretary-General to report on his efforts for the preparation and convening of a regional conference on security, stability and development within one month of the adoption of this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">According to the Secretary-General's report, the Government of Rwanda has taken steps to improve relations with its neighbours. These efforts form a good basis for subregional cooperation and they have the full support of my delegation.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Egunsola</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his latest report on the situation in Rwanda and the activities of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). We are encouraged by the Government's efforts in trying to stabilize the political, security and socio-economic conditions of the country 12 months after what the Secretary-General himself has described as one of the most tragic chapters in Africa's history. Starting almost from scratch and with no infrastructures or public revenue, the Government in Kigali must be congratulated on its achievements. The international community has a moral duty to assist and complement the efforts of the Government, particularly in the areas of justice and national reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction, the humanitarian situation and the return of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Although the security situation in Rwanda has improved, thanks to the combined efforts of the Government and UNAMIR, tension and lack of security also continue to be reported along the borders, in particular from areas of Zaire adjacent to Rwanda. Reports of infiltration and sabotage by armed elements, as well as allegations that members of the forces of the former Government are conducting military training and receiving deliveries of arms, have greatly heightened tensions in the border areas. In fact the Governments of Zaire and Rwanda recently admitted that the situation in the border zone had further deteriorated.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">My delegation has supported the request of Rwanda -- as part of measures to stabilize the situation and assure the Government of Rwanda of its own security -- that restrictions on the acquisition of arms imposed under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a> in so far as they relate to the Government of Rwanda, be lifted. This would not only enable the Government to defend itself and its citizens, but also serve to deter military adventurism from opponents of the Government from outside. We believe that the mere knowledge that the Government is in a position to properly defend itself will make them think twice. To that end, Nigeria together with other members of the caucus of the Non-Aligned Movement, initiated the draft resolution before us today.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">I believe we all appreciate the fact that no Government will sit by idly when a force determined to obliterate it is forming and arming a few miles across its border. And if we are to save the people of Rwanda, who have already suffered so much, from being subjected to another cycle of violence we have to act now, particularly as we know that any military action in Rwanda would further destabilize the already unstable situation in the whole area of the Great Lakes. Moreover, if we expect the Government of Rwanda to take full responsibility for peace and security inside the country, we cannot deny the Government the legitimate means with which to carry out this responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">None the less, my Government is not unaware of the other side of the argument, that introducing more weapons to an already volatile environment has its own destabilizing effects. That was why the caucus of the Non-Aligned Movement incorporated into the text of the draft resolution safeguards to ensure that the weapons get only to the intended beneficiary and are put to the use to which a legitimate Government has a right, that is, self-defence: no more, no less. Furthermore, in order to ensure transparency and, more important, to assure the international community -- particularly the neighbouring States -- that the arms will be put to legitimate defensive purposes alone, we have agreed to a one-year trial period during which these restrictions will only be suspended. My delegation also supports the proposal to establish a commission to conduct a full investigation of allegations of illegal arms flows into the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">We look forward in the next 12 months to a termination of the arms embargo as it relates to the Government of Rwanda. We are confident that security conditions both within and outside Rwanda's borders will have improved substantially, making the further acquisition of arms by the Government unnecessary even after the arms embargo is lifted.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">To make this possible, however, necessary steps in the areas of justice, national reconciliation and political accommodation will have to be undertaken by the Government of Rwanda, supported by the international community. For the moment, we are encouraged by the further steps that have been taken to get the International Tribunal for Rwanda up and running. We hope it will be able to commence substantive work in the near future. We agree that in the meantime something has to be done about the serious congestion in the prisons, which constitutes a major humanitarian crisis. The Government of Rwanda requires the assistance of the international community in order to improve the prison conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">With regard to the return of the refugees, we believe that some of the steps being taken by the Government, as well as the proposals for a regional approach that were agreed in Nairobi and Bujumbura, would, if implemented, address the urgent problems facing the repatriation of refugees. We also support the proposals put forward by the Secretary-General to encourage dialogue among all sectors of Rwandese society, including those in the diaspora but not those suspected or implicated in last year's genocide.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">On the performance of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), we commend the contributions that have been made and continue to be made by UNAMIR personnel in the discharge of their mandates, and call upon the Government of Rwanda to continue to extend the necessary cooperation to UNAMIR.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, my delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his personal commitment to ensuring the stability of the region, as evidenced by his recent visit to the area.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Africa, given its vast size and natural and human resources, has great potential for development. However, the disintegration of the bipolar world has had a huge impact on Africa, which is now in great need of an environment of peace, unity and stability. China has always paid great attention to developments in Africa. We deeply sympathize with the conflict-torn African continent in the post-cold-war era and with its peoples in their suffering caused by the conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">China attaches importance to Africa. It has been an important component of China's foreign policy to support the African peoples in their endeavours to maintain peace and stability, and to strengthen friendly relations of cooperation with all African countries. We support the reasonable demands and just stands of African countries in international affairs. That is precisely what the Chinese delegation has been doing at the United Nations, including in the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">Since the outbreak of the crisis in Rwanda, the international community -- particularly the Organization of African Unity and Rwanda's neighbours -- have made commendable efforts towards the early restoration of peace and stability in that country. The Rwandese Government has done tremendous work in promoting national reconciliation, repatriating refugees, rebuilding the homeland and improving the security situation throughout the country. At present, stability is gradually returning to Rwanda. There has also been some improvement in relations between the Rwandese Government and the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">All these are welcome developments. However, the repatriation of Rwandese refugees and displaced persons is proceeding slowly. The humanitarian situation remains grim. The flow of weapons into Rwanda has yet to be controlled. These problems, if not solved promptly, will severely undermine the process of national reconciliation undertaken by the Rwandese Government. Therefore, we believe that the Security Council should accord the same attention to the question of Rwanda that it accords to other regions and that the international community should continue to take measures to help the Rwandese Government and people resolve their current difficulties so that they can enjoy peace and stability again at an early date.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">In the light of the changed situation in Rwanda and at the request of the Rwandese Government, the Security Council today will adopt a resolution concerning the lifting of the arms embargo against the Rwandese Government. We hope that this move by the Council will contribute to national reconciliation in Rwanda within the framework of the Arusha Peace Agreement. We also hope to see an early solution to the arms problem in refugee camps outside Rwanda, in order to establish conditions for the repatriation of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">Based on its consistent position of support for the peace process in Rwanda, the Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before us. We sincerely hope that the Rwandese people will, under the leadership of their Government, continue to work together to build Rwanda into a country of peace and stability.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sidorov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">The delegation of the Russian Federation has repeatedly expressed its serious concern over the complicated and explosive situation in the Great Lakes subregion. The current hotbed of tension has been significantly exacerbated by the uncontrolled spread of arms among civilians and refugees, which has created a real threat to the peace and stability of all countries of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We are especially concerned by outside reports on military preparations and the increasing incursions of forces of the former Rwandan regime that are trying to destabilize the situation in Rwanda, whose people have just begun to heal their wounds after last year's unprecedented tragedy. We fully share the opinion expressed by the Secretary-General in his report of 8 August to the Security Council that the inhabitants of Rwanda, who have suffered so terribly, must not fall victim to yet another cycle of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The Russian delegation is firmly convinced that the tasks of ensuring security and strengthening peace and stability in Rwanda and throughout the region can be fulfilled only through a careful and integrated approach to the elimination of the causes of conflict and tension. It goes without saying that the Government of Rwanda, especially in the light of the imminent major reduction of the United Nations presence in that country, should be allowed to meet its own need for weapons within the limits of a sufficient defence capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">At the same time, in the light of the fragile situation in Rwanda and in a number of neighbouring countries, it is important that this process take place under firm international control and that it proceed in accordance with an internal settlement and with the changes in the military and political situation in the Central African region.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Parallel with this, measures should be taken, in our view, to bring about cooperation with the Governments of the countries of the region to curb the illegal inflow of weapons and to prevent their delivery to forces of the former Government on the territory of States around Rwanda and also within the refugee camps. An important step in this direction might be the deployment of United Nations military observers on the territory of those countries, and also the rapid establishment of a commission of inquiry into the illegal delivery of arms to armed units of the former Government of Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">At the same time, we assume that these measures will not have their full effect in terms of the long-term strengthening of peace and security if priority is not given to peace negotiations. In this connection, we fully support the idea of rapidly convening a regional conference on security, stability and development, and also of convening a regional meeting to solve problems related to the repatriation of refugees. It is extremely important to develop dialogue within Rwanda, with the participation of representatives of all sectors of the population of the country, and also through the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to strengthen conditions of stability and confidence that would ensure the return of refugees from neighbouring States. We think that it is precisely this type of integrated approach that will ensure a genuine settlement of the problems of Rwanda and of the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">In the Russian delegation's opinion, the draft resolution we are now considering in the Security Council is a balanced and careful text and fully responds to these tasks. We are prepared to support its adoption.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kovanda</span> <span class="nation">Czech Republic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">One year after the end to the genocide in Rwanda, one year after the end of the civil war, Rwandan authorities and the people of Rwanda have accomplished a very great deal in reconstructing their country. For this, they deserve our admiration and congratulations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">Problems remain, of course. Of these, none is more pressing than that of the refugees. Gathered in the millions in camps just outside the country, they are, on the one hand, being controlled, even terrorized, by camp leaders, partisans of Rwanda's previous genocidal regime, and, on the other hand, being demoralized by the ready handouts provided through the international community's generosity -- handouts that are an easier source of livelihood than working the fields in their home villages.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">Even more disturbing are reports of arms trafficking in the camps and of possible preparations for another military conflagration in the area. This gives the camp leadership a Khmer-Rouge tint, to be sure. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the draft resolution under consideration is operative paragraph 2, which would kick off a process that would eventually, we hope, lead to a thorough investigation of arms flows in the region; and we are pleased that the Government of Zaire has expressed its support for the establishment of a commission of inquiry to this effect.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">If the return of refugees is hindered by their campmasters, on the one side, they are not assured of a terribly warm welcome in Rwanda, on the other side. Unlike the situation of the camps, this is a situation over which Rwandan authorities have far greater control. Paradoxically, as domestic stability is ever more firmly established, the relative weight of responsibility for refugee return that falls on Rwandan authorities increases. The Government must have as its constant priority improving conditions: both those that are tied directly to refugees' willingness to return and those that shape the overall image of the country and thus influence their willingness to return, at least indirectly.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Two of the latter aspects are particularly important: the situation in jails and the justice system. The two are linked. There can be no excuse for 50,000 people to be languishing in jails a year after the end to the genocide -- with no relief in sight, because no trials have started. It is imperative that the Government, which we hear is not united in its view on these matters, demonstrate the necessary political will and resolve fundamental political issues that are delaying the process, namely: first, the nomination of judges to the Supreme Court; secondly, the use of expatriate personnel in the judicial system; and, thirdly, the solution of procedural irregularities that have resulted from the emergency nature of most arrests.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">The start of trials has to become a priority for all branches of government; the legislature and the executive have to cooperate with the judiciary for judicial action to begin.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">This draft resolution started out as one dealing with the now-obsolete provisions of the arms embargo that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a> imposed on Rwanda. The embargo was imposed on a genocidal regime, and many of us recall the sorry spectacle of a representative of that regime sitting at this table, making his objectionable presentation and voting against paragraph 13, which actually imposed the embargo. Surely, a lot has changed since then.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Today we are in effect suspending the arms embargo for a little over a year, allowing it to terminate automatically unless the Council decides to reimpose it, based on a report that the Secretary-General is called upon to submit next August. In other words, Rwanda is not off the embargo hook entirely; and one hopes that progress in solving its domestic problems, and, for that matter, progress in resolving the camp-population issue, will be so clear that there will be no reason to reimpose it.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">The embargo-suspending provisions of this draft resolution rightly emphasize two things: first, any arms flows into Rwanda must be destined solely for the Rwandan Government forces -- that is to say, for no other forces in the country, and for the forces of no other Government outside the country; and, secondly, the free-for-all arms bazaar is one of the greatest scourges of the countries in the region.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fulci</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">To explain my delegation's position on the draft resolution before the Council, allow me to begin by recalling the Italian Government's strong conviction that the serious crisis afflicting the region of the Great Lakes can be solved only through political and diplomatic means -- certainly not through military means. Stability and security in the entire region, including Rwanda, can be fostered not through an increase in arms -- we all know that there are already too many in the area -- but through confidence-building measures aimed at creating a climate of trust and dialogue and through a diplomatic conference with the participation of all the Great Lakes States, which, in our opinion, could greatly help to find a global solution to the many problems of the area.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">As one more tragic proof of the excessive circulation of weapons in the area, let me recall the cowardly killing, on Sunday, 6 August, in the vicinity of Goma, close to the Rwandan border, of six Italian citizens, six people of good will engaged in humanitarian work on behalf of the Italian non-governmental organization <i>Mondo Giusto</i>, which means "A Just World". The perpetrators are still unknown, but, according to the account of the only survivor, they did not steal any property from the victims. Clearly, they wanted to send an ominous message of some sort. In this regard, my Government's and my gratitude goes to all colleagues who have in recent days expressed their condolences, which I have already conveyed to the families.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The Italian Government is fully aware, on the one hand, of the legal and political grounds for the Rwandan Government's request to have reinstated its capacity to defend the country, and, on the other hand, is fully aware that conditions have evolved since the embargo was imposed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">There is still a threat to the stability of Rwanda, primarily by elements belonging to the former Government and army, which entertain hopes of revenge. Another threat to stability comes from the fact that a large number of Rwandans, for fear of reprisals, are still living in refugee camps outside Rwanda, thus preventing a true and complete process of national reconciliation and denying the contribution of their work and their talent to the economic recovery of Rwanda. Needless to say, the result of all this is that instability spreads throughout the area and threatens the security of other countries, not of Rwanda alone.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Therefore, we believe that it is crucial for the Council not to be seen as sending the wrong message that only a resort to weapons would provide sufficient security. This is why we have agreed to a cautious approach by postponing to a later date the definitive lifting of the embargo, while suspending its effects in the meantime. The draft resolution attaches conditions to ensure that it will not result in another wave of proliferation: arms will have to be marked and registered, and the Sanctions Committee has to be notified of their supply.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We have noted with satisfaction the more positive recent developments in Rwanda, as reflected in the report of the Secretary-General. It is reassuring, in particular, to see that working relations between the Rwandan Government and the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) -- to which my Government attaches the greatest importance -- are better now than in the past. The draft resolution takes due note of this fact. Of course, a lot still needs to be done, especially in some areas, such as the overcrowding of the prisons and all the ensuing problems. Not only is it necessary to train the police and provide it with new arms; it is also necessary to rebuild the judicial system. One of the main reasons why the Blue Helmets are still there is exactly to help the Kigali Government in this particular field and to achieve genuine national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">UNAMIR's capacity to fully implement its mandate will encourage, we believe, the voluntary repatriation of refugees to Rwanda. Their return should remain a top priority of the Kigali Government, as it should remain a top priority for the international community. We fully share the views of the Secretary-General in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">History has given ample evidence that the massive presence of refugees in camps right outside the border of a State is bound to provoke violence and instability. The people of Rwanda have already experienced enough violence and enough bloodbaths.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">For all these reasons, I will cast Italy's vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Inderfurth</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa01">The United States has just cast its vote in favour of a resolution which in effect removes the arms embargo placed upon the previous Government of Rwanda. The current Government of Rwanda has been seeking this change for a number of months, and we have supported its request from the beginning. The Government of Rwanda faces a threat from extremists in the militias and former army, who will -- according to the terms of today's resolution -- continue to be restricted from buying arms. With the adoption of this resolution, the Government of Rwanda will be better able to deter violent action by these groups or, if necessary, defend the new Rwandan society it is trying to build. The Government of Rwanda has agreed to certain conditions, such as reporting its purchases to the Council, in order to assuage the concerns of Council members and neighbouring States. We appreciate the flexibility shown by the Government of Rwanda on these issues. We fully support its right of self-defence, but underline that an unwarranted stockpiling of arms should not take place.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa02">This step, however, goes only part of the way towards normalizing the situation in Rwanda. The prompt submission by the Secretary-General of recommendations for a commission of inquiry into allegations of arms flows to former Rwandan armed forces and the speedy establishment of such a commission are also necessary for the reduction of tension and the creation of a climate of trust.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa03">Today's resolution underlines the expectation that the Government of Rwanda will shoulder all the responsibilities of an effective government, including creating the conditions of trust and confidence which are necessary for the safe and voluntary return of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa04">One key element in creating such a climate of trust is an immediate improvement in the overcrowded conditions of Rwandan prisons. The United States is gravely concerned about the humanitarian crisis caused by the detention of more than 50,000 prisoners. We believe the Government of Rwanda should take measures as soon as possible to reduce the prison population through the release of young and elderly prisoners whenever possible, to reach agreement with international humanitarian organizations on steps to alleviate the overcrowding, to reduce the number of arrests to the absolute minimum, and to take steps to establish a functioning judiciary in Rwanda, beginning with naming a new Supreme Court.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa05">The Council's action today takes one step towards addressing the problems of the region. We trust that the Secretary-General and the Governments of Rwanda and its neighbours will also take steps which are necessary for improving the situation. The Council, for its part, will surely be taking further actions to address the multifaceted situation in Central Africa.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ladsous</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution just adopted by the Security Council. I must note, however, that we did so in spite of questioning the timeliness of the decision.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">My Government entirely understands that from the legal standpoint the Kigali authorities wish to regain full sovereignty. It is normal for a Government to request full exercise of its competence to ensure the security of its inhabitants, and for it to possess the means to do so. By suspending the embargo against Rwanda until 1 September 1996 the Security Council has just complied with this request.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Yet the decision we have just taken should not be completely separated from the political context in Rwanda and in other countries of the region. We know that the Kigali Government has made many efforts to promote normalization of the situation in Rwanda, and the 8 August 1995 report of the Secretary-General testifies to this. But the report also stresses that many problems have only barely begun to be resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">There are nearly 2 million Rwandan citizens outside the borders of Rwanda. We have been saying for over a year that the return of refugees -- with the exception of criminals, who must be put on trial -- must be a priority for the Kigali Government. We are obliged to note that, for the moment, very few have agreed to return to their villages. To be sure, the fault lies in part with the militias, which continue to pressure these innocent civilians, but the situation in Rwanda does not really encourage their return.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">There continue to be large numbers of arrests; the conditions of detention are tragic; there is a near absence of dialogue between the refugees and the Kigali authorities: none of this is likely to make Rwandan expatriates return home. We think that the decision to lift the embargo will be an added deterrent, which is why we would have preferred a gradual lifting of the embargo that dealt on a priority basis with equipment for maintaining order, and especially for equipping the police and the gendarmerie.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">But we have no wish to despair. We hope that the authorization to import weapons, now granted to the Government of Rwanda, will be used in a measured, well-advised way, and that the additional flows of weapons will not increase tension among the countries of the region, as some signs seem to indicate they will.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">The international community must continue to give its full support to the Kigali Government to enable it to complete the work of national reconciliation and reconstruction to which it has committed itself. If we want to avoid new disasters, we must make rapid progress towards that goal.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">My Government remains convinced that the rapid organization of a regional conference on peace, security and development would lay a solid, indispensable foundation for the restoration of stability in the Great Lakes region. That is why we await with interest the report the Secretary-General is to make to the Security Council within one month.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">For its part, the French Government remains fully prepared to participate in a constructive initiative that would allow the reintegration of all Rwandans into their homeland, the restoration of democracy and the resumption of progress in that part of Africa.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cárdenas</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">The resolution the Security Council has just adopted includes a necessary and justified measure: the lifting of the embargo on arms and related <i>matériel </i>that had been imposed on the Government of Rwanda. Members will recall that by its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a> the Council imposed the embargo on the former Government of Rwanda in circumstances completely different from those of today.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Internally and externally, the situation has changed, and the serious security concerns are no longer aroused from within, but rather from outside Rwanda. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his valuable report (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-678.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/678</a>), which points to important progress in a number of areas; to an appreciable improvement in the security situation in Rwanda and in relations between the Government and the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR); to the Government's adoption of measures to encourage the voluntary return of refugees, including an invitation that was extended to representatives of the refugees to visit Rwanda; to the intensification of bilateral contacts in the region; and to a gradual shift in the focus of the international community, from emergency assistance to the phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The report of the Secretary-General also notes the tension and lack of security in areas neighbouring Rwanda, which are exacerbated by reports of infiltration and sabotage by armed elements, and by accusations that members of the forces of the former Government and militias have been engaging in military training and have received arms from abroad.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">In these circumstances, the Security Council has a responsibility with respect to the external security of Rwanda, a Member State bearing the burden of the arms embargo. Because of this responsibility; because we consider that the embargo must be viewed as an exceptional measure and in a restricted context; because, as we said earlier, the present situation in Rwanda is totally different from that which earlier prompted the imposition of the embargo; because Rwanda should be enabled to guarantee the security of its inhabitants and to exercise its right of self-defence: for those reasons the Argentine Republic supported the lifting of the embargo on arms and related <i>matériel </i>with respect to the Government of Rwanda, and the retention of the embargo with respect to those in the States neighbouring Rwanda if such sale or supply is for the purpose of the use of the arms within Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">To be sure, we are fully aware of the problems Rwanda faces because of the absence of an effective justice system and the abuses and arbitrary arrests and detentions arising from the remaining limitations and from the inhuman conditions in its prisons. We also recognize the particularly tense and volatile situation in the Great Lakes region, and we note with concern that no less than a quarter of Rwanda's population lives in refugee camps in neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Owing to this special situation, which involves not only Rwanda, we support the temporary implementation of a system of notification and the marking and registering of arms entering Rwanda; this will serve to win the confidence of the refugees and dispel all doubts about Rwanda's true intentions with respect to arms.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">We believe that the implementation of this special monitoring regime might have been enough to lift the arms embargo, without the need to call for a new decision by the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">We wish to take this opportunity to urge the countries of the region, many of which are subject to many difficult problems because of the massive presence of refugees in their territories, to join forces in order to resolve together the region's critical security and stability situation. In that respect, we encourage swift responses to the requests in paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">We acknowledge the achievements of the Government of Rwanda in its efforts to redress a situation that was until very recently tragic and in its population's recovery of its normal rhythm of life. None the less, much remains to be done, and in that respect we urge the Government of Rwanda to redouble its efforts to promote dialogue between all its political sectors and to guarantee respect for human rights and the security of its entire populace. This effort is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">The promotion of the voluntary return of refugees must also continue to be a priority, since without the integration of all Rwandans and respect for their diversity there will be no lasting stability.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa11">The tragedy experienced by the people of Rwanda barely a year ago has extremely complex social, psychological, political and economic dimensions. We know it is no easy task to redress quickly a situation like this one, and this is the challenge facing the Government of Rwanda. In the performance of that task, we trust that the international community will continue to contribute, and indeed will increase its contribution, to the effort for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Rwanda.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Henze</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">First of all, I should like to express my delegation's satisfaction that the Council was able to reach a unanimous decision on the matter of the arms embargo against the Rwandan Government. This resolution demonstrates the Council's ability to take decisions on difficult issues.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">My delegation voted in favour of this resolution, which suspends the embargo against the Government of Rwanda for one year and lifts it as of 1 September 1996. We understand that the lifting of the embargo is more a matter of principle for the Rwandan Government than an issue of practical concern. We voted in favour of the resolution because we think it is a well-balanced text. On the one hand, it takes into account the legitimate demands of the Rwandan Government. On the other hand, it acknowledges the fragile security situation in the subregion. It was therefore appropriate to link the Rwandan Government's right to buy weapons with extensive control mechanisms, including Rwanda's obligation to notify the sanctions Committee of its arms purchases.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">The arms embargo against Rwanda is not an isolated question. It is closely linked to the overall situation in the Great Lakes region. The resolution has taken this aspect into account by requesting the Secretary-General to make recommendations to the Council as soon as possible on a commission to investigate the flow of arms to forces of the former Rwandan Government. In our view, such a commission should be established without further delay, and we hope that all the countries concerned will cooperate with it. In this respect, we welcome, in particular, the commitment of the Government of Zaire to work with such a commission. I should like to point out that, in addition, we would still prefer the deployment of United Nations military observers in the border regions, in particular at the airfields in eastern Zaire. Also, the urgent convening of a regional conference remains an absolute priority.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The return of the Rwandan refugees remains central to the question of stability in the Great Lakes region. In this respect, we call upon the Rwandan Government to intensify its rehabilitation efforts and, in particular, its efforts for national reconciliation. We urge the Government to start a genuine national dialogue with all members of Rwandan society, excluding, of course, those responsible for last year's genocide. In order to promote a climate of trust in the country, we also call upon the Government to address immediately the situation in its desperately overcrowded prisons and the necessary reform of its judicial system. Germany is ready to give assistance to alleviate the situation of the prisoners.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The resolution we have just adopted is an important step towards the normalization of the situation in this part of Africa. But more remains to be done. The main responsibility lies with the countries of the region themselves. We are determined to assist them in their efforts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir John Weston</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">The British Government welcomes the adoption of this resolution. We believe it is a sensible, balanced text, the provisions of which will contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region. My delegation is particularly grateful for the helpful and constructive contribution made by the Rwandan delegation during the negotiations on the text. We welcome its agreement to the arrangements for notification of all arms supplied to the Government of Rwanda under the terms of this resolution, which we believe will be an important confidence-building measure with respect to neighbouring countries.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">My delegation also welcomes the provisions in this resolution aimed at tightening the embargo where it remains in place. In this context we are pleased to see that the resolution reinforces the ban on arms transfers to exiled extremist groups. We look forward to receiving the Secretary-General's recommendations on a commission to investigate alleged arms flows to forces of the former Rwandan Government in the Great Lakes region. We call upon all States in the region to respond positively and constructively to the Secretary-General's further consultations concerning the deployment of United Nations military observers to monitor the embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">The British Government hopes that, when the Security Council comes to review the issue of the operation of the arms embargo in 12 months' time, we will be able to register a net improvement in the political and security situation in the Great Lakes region.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">At the same time, we believe that a lasting solution to the problems of this region can be brought about only by peaceful means, through political and diplomatic activity, including, in particular, dialogue and negotiation. In that context, we welcome the efforts made by the Government of Rwanda to promote national reconciliation. We hope these efforts can be intensified in order to help create an atmosphere of security, trust and confidence conducive to the safe return of refugees, which remains essential for the long-term stability of Rwanda and the region as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The international community must also play a part in this process. We look forward to receiving the Secretary-General's report on his efforts to convene a regional conference on security, stability and development, and on the case for a possible regional meeting on the repatriation of refugees, in which, no doubt, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will have a role.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bakuramutsa</span> <span class="nation">Rwanda</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like at the outset to express its condolences to the representative of Italy on the death of Italian citizens who became victims in Zaire of people they had gone to help and their hosts. My delegation has always denounced the mixing of refugees with armed groups; it has always denounced the policy of a host country that supports armed groups that hide in the midst of refugees to manipulate and use them.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We would ask the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and particularly its office in Zaire, to carry out its responsibility to facilitate the return of the refugees and to condemn dealings between the camps under its control and the camps of the former Rwandan forces.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">We would also ask the partners of the Governments of the area of the Great Lakes that are interested in the situation in Rwanda to help reduce tensions in the region. The question of the Rwandan refugees has been exploited in various ways which are in the interests of neither Rwanda nor the refugees. There are those who would like to use the refugees to enhance their image with the international community and play a key role in the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">We recall the fact that Belgium and France have a major, historic responsibility in the current situation in Rwanda. This responsibility is entirely shared with the United Nations in general and with the Security Council in particular. It necessitates cooperation with the Rwandan Government to put the country back on track, to rebuild it and Rwandan society. But my delegation emphasizes that the historic responsibility I have referred to does not give any country the right to set itself up as the spokesman for Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">I should like, through you, Mr. President, to thank the Secretary-General wholeheartedly for his visit to Rwanda. It was high time it took place, and it was necessary not only for Rwanda but for the United Nations. But above all I thank the Secretary-General for his report, which describes the real developments in Rwanda one year after the assumption of power by a Government that has fought genocide and is attempting to put the country back on its feet. Without much in the way of human resources, without <i>matériel</i>, Rwanda is on the right track: after the genocide of an eighth of its population, Rwanda has succeeded in bringing together 6 million Rwandese and has made it possible for people traumatized by cruel torture and brainwashed by State and Church propaganda to live together. Rwanda has succeeded in establishing a government of national unity, a parliament representing all political parties in the country and has restored electricity and telephones and other means of communication.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">The Government has made an exceptional effort to put the country back on its feet. By way of example, I would note that after the Second World War one European country had 60,000 people executed: Rwanda has killed no one. And those who engaged in vengeance or personal justice in Rwanda were executed.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">That is why my delegation asks those countries that are sheltering the criminals who have engaged in genocide to take appropriate measures to arrest them, since those countries have signed the Convention on genocide.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">The fear in the Great Lakes region has not been created by weapons: but it has been created by the impunity that prevails there. The Government of Rwanda wishes to establish in the country a state of law which is based not on fear or force but on justice.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">As I have stated on more than one occasion, there is no proliferation of arms in Rwanda. In Rwanda, the priority is not the purchase of weapons. The priority is national reconstruction, the return of the refugees and the rebuilding of Rwandese society.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">Rwanda's main objective in submitting this resolution was based on the principle of the sovereignty of the country and its right and duty to defend its population and its territory.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">Rwanda has no intention whatsoever of provoking a war against its neighbours. Rwanda shares many interests with all the bordering countries. But the current Government does not want to inherit an embargo which was imposed upon the genocide Government. Instead of being arrested and brought to trial, the members of that genocide Government have been fed, taken care of, housed, trained and armed. The "brains" of that former Government, its soldiers and the members of its militias have never expressed regret for their acts. On the contrary, they are arming in order to commit the same crimes again. The real danger for the region is the impunity that the international community seems to be encouraging; it is a much greater danger than the weapons that are being acquired.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">My delegation would like, in conclusion, sincerely to thank those countries that are giving their support to Rwanda so that it can pursue its development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">As to the countries neighbouring Rwanda, in Central and Eastern Africa, and the European countries that are still hesitating, on behalf of my Government my delegation invites them to visit Rwanda, to see with their own eyes what the country has achieved, and to establish with the representatives of the Rwandese people a better form of cooperation, based on mutual respect.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Khussaiby</span> <span class="nation">Oman</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to express on behalf of my delegation our appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his progress report on the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) as well as for his latest visit to Rwanda, which has reflected the international community's concern and its interest in assisting the people of Rwanda to grapple with the aftermath of the tragic events that befell their country last year.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">We note with satisfaction that the security situation in the country has improved considerably since last June. Working relations between the Government of Rwanda and UNAMIR has also improved. As a consequence, the restrictions on UNAMIR's freedom of movement have been lifted and the Mission is now in a better position to carry out its mandate successfully.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">On the political level, we welcome the strenuous efforts of the Rwandese Government to promote law and order in the country and to encourage national reconciliation through fostering confidence-building measures and the safety and voluntary return of the refugees. We welcome, in particular, the Rwandan Government's attitude towards the refugee delegations who are visiting the country to see for themselves the current situation in Rwanda and who will share their impressions with the refugees in the camps. We hope that the favourable impression with which they leave will dispel the refugees' fears and speed up their repatriation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">However, there are clearly a number of obstacles which should be overcome if the process of national reconciliation is to bear fruit. This includes the overcrowding in the Rwandan prisons, the inadequacy of the judicial system, and the tension on the borders with some neighbouring countries. But most dangerous of all are the continuing reports that elements of the former Government army and militia are regrouping, training and rearming themselves with a view to a violent return to Rwanda. My delegation is of the view that the international community should continue its efforts aimed at preventing the recurrence of last year's tragic events in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">In this connection, we welcome the resolution we have just adopted suspending until September 1996 the restrictions on arms sales or supply imposed under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a>, with a view to lifting it totally thereafter. We believe that in view of the new realities on the ground and the change in the circumstances which prompted the imposition of those restrictions, this action on the part of the Council is fully justified.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Moreover, the Government of Rwanda, like any other sovereign Government, has every right to exercise its inherent right of self-defence against any elements which pose a threat to its territorial integrity and security. We consider the aims of the Rwandan Government to be noble, and any deviation from those principles will complicate the actions of this Council in the future.W e deem it appropriate that these restrictions remain on the non-governmental forces so that this measure can accomplish its dual purpose.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">On the other hand, we have seen a deterioration of security in the border areas between Rwanda and Zaire. The Council needs to keep a close watch on arms movements in that part of Africa. That is why we believe that the question of the registration of weapons is very important, as indicated in paragraph 11 of the resolution. My delegation commends the Government of Rwanda for giving its acceptance. My delegation also concurs with paragraph 10, which addresses the movement of weapons to neighbouring countries or to people not in the service of the Government of Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">We know very well that the justice system in Rwanda needs the help of the international community. This is an area which cannot be established efficiently overnight. At the same time, many detainees are languishing in jails which are in very, very bad shape. Here, too, Rwanda needs the urgent help of the international community. But, more than that, we need Rwanda's commitment and will to offer fair treatment to all its people and in trying to promote reconciliation among its people.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">Finally, we hope that the support of our Council for the Rwandan call to lift the arms embargo will be taken as a gesture of the Council's trust and confidence in the efforts already demonstrated by the Rwanda Government.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">At the outset, my delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the progress of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda and the valuable observations contained therein, which have provided the necessary framework for the Council's discussion on the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">My delegation voted in favour of the resolution before us today, which decides that the restrictions imposed by paragraph 13 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 918 (1994)</a> concerning the sale or supply of arms and related <i>matériel </i>to the Government of Rwanda shall be suspended, and terminated permanently on 1 September 1996, unless the Security Council decides otherwise. The arms embargo was imposed because the uncontrollable circulation of arms was a major factor in the destabilization of the country. In fact, the present Government has made serious efforts towards stability and a peaceful reconstruction of Rwanda, and it is therefore our view that the decision which the Council has taken today will in fact help prevent a recurrence of past violence.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Considering the recent history of Rwanda, it is understandable that there may be some concern that an increasing flow of arms may lead to disorder in the country, but the resolution should be seen from a more positive perspective. It marks an important step in the development of Rwanda and represents the international community's adjusting views on its realities. Furthermore, elements in the resolution, such as a review of the effects of the resolution in six months and one year, as reflected in paragraph 12, would help ensure the fulfilment of its basic objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">It is essential that the Rwandan Government refrain from the use of arms and related <i>matériel </i>for any but legitimate purposes in accordance with international law, such as self-defence. We expect that the resolution will enable Rwanda to take primary responsibility for maintaining its own security structure, independent of United Nations forces, in order to ensure peace and stability throughout the Great Lakes region. In this regard, it is of paramount importance that the countries surrounding Rwanda contribute to monitoring the arms flow in the region in order to prevent civilians or destabilizing forces in the region, especially refugees in Rwandan camps within their territories, from acquiring military <i>matériel</i>. Therefore, my delegation supports the establishment of a commission to investigate the alleged arms flow to former Rwandan government forces in the region, as reflected in paragraph 2.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">The lifting of the embargo on the Government of Rwanda does not come without a measure of responsibility. We are confident that Rwanda fully recognizes the importance of continuing its efforts to create an atmosphere of confidence and trust for the safe return of refugees and that it will strive towards a solution to the humanitarian problems regarding its prisons. To that end, we also underline the need for increased efforts to expedite the improvement of the prison and judicial system.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">The Indonesian delegation is pleased to note the spirit of cooperation with which the Council has responded to the resolution, which respects the sovereign right of the Government of Rwanda to maintain peace and security, while addressing concerns about a recurrence of the tragedy that claimed the lives of so many innocent civilians in Rwanda's terrible civil war.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Finally, my delegation would be remiss if we failed to express our appreciation to all the military, police and civilian personnel of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda for their tireless efforts on our behalf in working for peace and stability in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">There are no further speakers on my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
