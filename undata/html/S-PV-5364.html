	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council commends the efforts of the African Union for successful deployment of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) and for significant contribution to the provision of a secure environment for civilians and the humanitarian situation in Darfur. The Security Council welcomes the African Union Peace and Security Council's recognition of the partnership between the African Union and the United Nations in the promotion of peace, security and stability in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council takes note of the 12 January 2006 Communiqué of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union in which the PSC expressed its support, in principle, for a transition from the African Union Mission in Sudan to a United Nations operation, and requested the Chairperson of the African Union's Commission to initiate consultations with the United Nations and other stakeholders on this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council therefore requests the Secretary-General to initiate contingency</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk07-pa06">planning without delay, jointly with the African Union, in close and continuing consultation with the Security Council, and in cooperation and close consultation with the parties to the Abuja Peace Talks, including the Government of National Unity, on a range of options for a possible transition from AMIS to a United Nations operation. Such planning should be undertaken on the basis of a unified, integrated approach; of maximum use of existing AMIS and United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) resources subject to the agreement of troop-contributing countries; of an assessment, to be confirmed by the Council, of the essential tasks to be carried out in southern Sudan and Darfur with a view to reallocate existing troops and assets to the maximum extent practicable; and of a readiness to review and adjust the current structure of UNMIS, including command and control and logistics, at the earliest opportunity to make best use of available resources when the African Union deems a transition feasible and agreeable. The Security Council will be engaged throughout this process.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong support for AMIS until any eventual transition is completed. The Security Council looks forward to an early decision from the African Union Peace and Security Council and will keep this issue under consideration with a view to reviewing the options submitted by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council stresses the importance of urgently reaching a successful conclusion of the Abuja Talks and calls on all parties to negotiate in good faith in order to reach a peace accord as soon as possible. The Security Council reiterates in the strongest terms the need for all parties in Darfur to end the violence and atrocities. The Security Council demands all parties to the Darfur conflict to cooperate fully with AMIS and to fulfil all the obligations to which they have committed themselves."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-5.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/5</a>.</p>
