<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01"> I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Malaysia, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in which they request to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to participate in the consideration, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01"> I also wish to remind all speakers, as was indicated by my President at this morning's session, to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">I now give the floor to the representative of Japan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Okuda</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai served as a poignant reminder for all of us of the serious threat that terrorism continues to pose seven years after the tragic events of September 2001. Following the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Japanese Prime Minister Aso conveyed to Prime Minister Singh of India Japan's willingness to cooperate with India and to assist in the investigation. Having just witnessed that despicable crime, we consider it very timely to have an open debate in the Security Council on the topic of "Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts". We would therefore like to express our sincere appreciation for the valuable initiative taken by President Mesi in convening this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Japan fully agrees with the idea emphasized in the concept paper prepared by Croatia that it would be meaningful for the international community to reaffirm its solidarity against terrorism at this juncture. We also endorse the paper's recommendation strongly advocating for a multidimensional and comprehensive approach to countering terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I hardly need to reiterate the importance of the role of the Council. In particular, three of the Council's subsidiary committees continue to play a crucial role. Member States have primary responsibility for the implementation of relevant resolutions. The Council and its subsidiary bodies must do their best to facilitate the efforts made by the Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">This year, as Chair of the Group of Eight (G-8), Japan has been striving to strengthen cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Action Group established by the G-8 and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate here at Headquarters. It is our hope that this cooperation will contribute to enhanced cooperation between the Council and Member States, especially in the area of counter-terrorism assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">Seven years after the 11 September attacks, Afghanistan and its surrounding areas remain the most critical region in our fight against terrorism. In this regard, in addition to various measures taken on the ground, we believe that full recognition should be given to the importance of the related maritime operations. Japan has been contributing to the counter-terrorism operations in the Indian Ocean since 2001 and we are determined to continue this effort.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">Japan also believes that regional cooperation has a crucial role in our counter-terrorism efforts. To advance such cooperation, Japan has been participating actively in various regional initiatives and working closely with regional partners, particularly in South-east Asia. To cite one example, we have been cooperating with countries that are preparing for their accession to relevant international conventions. In 2003, we began to organize seminars, mainly for Asian experts, on the promotion of accession to international counter-terrorism conventions and protocols.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">Counter-terrorism measures must not be confined to traditional measures related to law enforcement; non-traditional areas identified in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy must also be adequately addressed. In particular, efforts to reduce poverty and measures in the area of education must be further strengthened in order to address conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">Japan continues to believe that the United Nations must play an integral role in the fight against terrorism. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy provides a valuable basis for our unified efforts in that context, and the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-272.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 62/272</a>, which reaffirmed the Strategy and called for its implementation, was very welcome. Through this open debate, the Council should renew its commitment to addressing the serious threat to international peace and security posed by terrorism. Japan takes this opportunity to reaffirm its willingness to contribute to the Council's efforts in that regard.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Liechtenstein.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wenaweser</span> <span class="nation">Liechtenstein</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Government and the people of Liechtenstein, I would like to express our solidarity with and sincere condolences to all those victimized by the recent terrorist attacks in India. We unequivocally condemn such heinous acts of terrorism -- irrespective of their motivation and wherever and by whomever committed -- and reiterate our full commitment to international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">We are grateful for the concept paper (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-738.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/738</a>) submitted by the President for today's debate, and our statement will be focused on a few specific points.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">We strongly agree with the notion reflected in the paper that the use of armed force cannot be the only answer to the scourge of terrorism and that terms such as "war on terrorism" have brought about more problems than solutions, in particular with respect to the uniform application of international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">We believe that today's debate provides us with a good opportunity to promote international solidarity in countering terrorism on the basis of a comprehensive approach, as reflected in the United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy of September 2006. Merely reaffirming those commitments, however, will not by itself improve our response to terrorism. During the seven years following the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United Nations has massively scaled up its global counter-terrorism toolbox, and Member States as well as international and regional organizations have taken numerous steps to that effect; but still the threat of terrorism seems more pervasive than ever. That simple fact underlines the limitations of traditional counter-terrorism measures and the need to systematically address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorist activities.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">This Council has a particular role to play in that regard with respect to the need to address a number of long-term conflict situations whose repercussions are being felt all over the world and that are directly related to violent extremism. Other parts of the United Nations system, including the General Assembly, are called upon to redouble their efforts, within their respective mandates, that contribute to the prevention of terrorism. In that regard, we recall that the General Assembly has a particular responsibility that it needs to address urgently: the finalization of the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We hope that renewed vigour in global counter-terrorism cooperation will bring about a political climate in which the outstanding issues with respect to what has been termed the definition of terrorism can be solved.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">The Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy identifies the absence of the rule of law, human rights violations and a lack of good governance among the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. It is equally true that the fight against terrorism can have a negative impact on the rule of law, human rights and good governance, as States and international organizations take sometimes urgent and forceful counter-terrorism measures without allowing for appropriate checks and balances on executive action.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">The United Nations Special Rapporteur to conduct a comprehensive study on terrorism and human rights has given numerous relevant examples of such measures where public and individual security interests are not always properly balanced against the human rights of affected individuals. Given the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security, including with respect to the fight against international terrorism, we are convinced that the Council should lead by example when dealing with the difficult question of balancing security interests and human rights. We are therefore pleased that further improvements have been made to the Council's counter-terrorism sanctions regime, and we urge the Council to take further necessary steps in that regard.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Kazakhstan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Aitimova</span> <span class="nation">Kazakhstan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Let me first of all express my appreciation to you, Sir, and to your country in its capacity as President of the Security Council during the month of December 2008, for organizing this open debate on one of the most critical issues of international peace and security. The continuing terrorist acts around the world are a constant and painful reminder that terrorism remains one of the most serious threats to all States and peoples. Terrorist acts cause the increasing mistrust of people in the capability of the international community to effectively respond to those inhumane acts of violence.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The terrible events that took place in Mumbai represent the most cruel and large-scale terrorist act since 11 September 2001. Together with the rest of the international community, Kazakhstan pays special tribute to the innocent victims of the barbaric act of the terrorists and expresses its solidarity with the Government of India.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">In his telegram of condolences to Indian Prime Minister Singh, President Nursultan Nazarbayev pointed out that, in this time of tragedy, it is necessary to strengthen international cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Kazakhstan is confident that only in that manner will it be possible to confront any act of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Today we are facing unprecedented global threats: inter-ethnic and inter-confessional conflicts; international terrorism and organized crime; natural, anthropogenic and humanitarian disasters; diseases and epidemics; and energy and environmental problems. The continued surge of terrorist acts throughout the world has laid bare the transnational nature of terrorism. One must recognize that terrorism is well organized, financially self-sufficient and bolstered by powerful ideological dictums that poison the consciousness of an ever-greater number of people. Against that background, the strengthening of the international legal framework of counter-terrorist cooperation is especially relevant. Kazakhstan supports the adoption without further delay of a comprehensive convention against international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">The United Nations, with its authority, universal character and unique experience, continues to play an indispensable leading and coordinating role in all global affairs. Its effectiveness, however, depends on our will; and we should, through joint efforts, reform the Organization with a view to strengthening the role of the Security Council in reacting expeditiously to the main challenges to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">We are sure that constructive and successful cooperation among United Nations Member States on the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy will strengthen regional and international security and eliminate the issue of international terrorism in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">Regional and subregional arrangements play a critical role in the efforts to enhance the effectiveness of global actions against terrorism. In particular, a significant contribution to counter-terrorism efforts in the Eurasian region could be made by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. The Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia is another such structure.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, we would like to express once again our deepest sorrow over the loss of innocent lives in all acts of terrorism and convey our sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims. We believe that the international community should join in the efforts to ensure broad and effective cooperation in the struggle to eliminate the threat of terrorism forever.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Cuba.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Núñez Mordoche</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa01">Cuba firmly condemns and rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including State terrorism. We consider that all terrorist acts, methods and practices wherever, by whomever and against whomever they are committed to be totally unjustifiable, whatever the motive invoked to justify them. The recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai are new and clear proof of the danger that terrorism represents for us all. Cuba expresses its sincere condolences to the people and the Government of India with regard to the victims of those criminal acts.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa02">We urge all States to fulfil the obligations they have undertaken to combat terrorism by prosecuting or, where appropriate, extraditing the perpetrators of terrorist acts; by preventing the organization, instigation or financing of such acts against other States from within or outside their territories or by organizations based in their territories; or by refraining from supplying arms or other means that could be used for terrorist acts in other States, among other actions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa03">Cuba also rejects acts, measures and the use or the threat of the use of force that violate the United Nations Charter and international law and that any State imposes or tries to impose against others under the pretext of combating terrorism. Likewise, our country categorically rejects the unilateral drawing up of lists accusing States of allegedly supporting terrorism, which are inconsistent with international law.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa04">We are convinced that multilateral cooperation, under the auspices of the United Nations, is the most effective way to combat international terrorism. We stress the importance of the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by all Member States. In that respect, we consider it appropriate to convene an international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, so as to define terrorism and adopt comprehensive and effective measures for joint action against it. We support the conclusion, as soon as possible and within the framework of the United Nations, of a comprehensive convention on combating international terrorism that includes the definition of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa05">For years, our country has been submitting to the Security Council detailed information on the terrorist acts against Cuba by various individuals and organizations, as well as on the conspiratorial protection that the United States Government offers them. To date, our denunciations have not received any concrete response from the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa06">It has been over a year and a half since the release in the United States of the terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, who is rightly designated the most notorious terrorist of the Western hemisphere. Despite having all the evidence against him for his countless terrorist acts, the United States Government has never done so. Cuba believes that that case is a clear and flagrant violation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and other relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, as well as a number of international legal instruments pertaining to the fight against terrorism. Once again, the Cuban Government demands that the United States authorities return the terrorist to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which has requested his extradition, or that they try him on their territory.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa07">While it lets self-confessed and unscrupulous terrorists go free, for over 10 years the United States Government has been keeping in high-security prisons five Cuban anti-terrorist fighters political prisoners, who were only trying, with great self-sacrifice and courage, to obtain information on Miami-based terrorist groups, so as to prevent their violent acts and save the lives of Cuban and United States citizens. Once again, we demand their immediate release.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa08">Double standards cannot prevail. It is impossible to eliminate terrorism, if some terrorist acts are condemned, while others are silenced, tolerated or justified. Cuba has never allowed, nor will it allow its territory to be used for terrorist acts against any State, without exception. As we have until now, we will continue firmly to fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the  representative of Israel.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Eilon Shahar</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">At the outset, Sir, I would like to thank you for convening this timely debate. I would also like to thank you for your leadership as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and I further recognize the Croatian stewardship of the Council of Europe's Committee of Experts on Terrorism. I also welcome the participation of the President of Croatia and the Secretary-General in this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">Israel believes that the issue of terrorism deserves to be among the highest priorities of this Council, the United Nations as a whole and all Member States. We welcome the opportunity to help reinvigorate international resolve to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">The recent horrific events in Mumbai clearly demonstrated that terrorism is one of the greatest global threats to international peace and security in recent history. My Government extends its condolences to the Indian people. Citizens from a number of other nations, including Israel, were also killed in those horrific days, and we also extend our condolences to the citizens of those countries, and especially to the families of all those who were lost and injured.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">Among the locations targeted by the terrorists was the Chabad House, where Israelis were singled out for cold-blooded murder. Rising out of the maelstrom of unspeakable acts was an Indian caregiver, who risked her life to save a two-year-old Israeli child. The caregiver's actions are proof that, while terrorists seek to destroy our way of life, the noblest human impulses and values must and will prevail.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">The events in Mumbai have shown, once again, that terrorism knows no borders and that international cooperation is crucial to defeating it. The chain of cooperation, from country to country, must be strong and complete. Otherwise, the terrorists will find the weak link and exploit it. We must control our borders, shut off the valve of funds to terrorist networks, including through sources such as drug trafficking, and face terrorism with a seamless, united front, pursuing terrorists wherever they may be. We also urge States to fully implement all their obligations under international law and to adhere to all relevant Security Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">Israel lies in a region heavily scarred by terrorism, and my country, in particular, has been on the front line of efforts to combat that evil for many decades. Israelis and Jews are targeted at home and abroad because of the passport they carry or their religion. Like any other terrorist group, Hezbollah and Hamas, two organizations committed to the destruction of my country, could not operate without the support given to them by States, in this case, Iran and Syria. We urge the international community to stand firm against those organizations and to speak in one voice against any State sponsorship of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">Terrorism is spreading at an alarming rate, expanding both in geography and in the audacity of the crimes. Terrorists abuse the benefits of globalization, including the free flow of people and information, in order to bring fear, misery and death to innocent civilians. We must also be acutely aware of the dangers of cyberterrorism. The perpetrators of terrorist acts operate outside the conventions of international relations and, indeed, in violation of basic human behaviour norms. They are not constrained by law, reason or even self-preservation. It is precisely those factors that have made this plague so difficult to fight.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Yet, in spite of the scale of the threat, we are hopeful. We have the tools to combat terrorists, but what we are lacking is universal political will. There are some regions and nations that have not displayed the needed sense of urgency. In some cases, States may turn a blind eye to terrorists in their midst. In other cases, they may even use terrorist organizations as a tool of foreign policy. However, whether the support is active or passive, it is still support. States that assist terrorists will, at the very least, alienate themselves from the international community. They must also be made to understand that they are helping to undermine their own sovereignty and that it is difficult to reverse that downward spiral.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">Around the world there are failed States and States in danger of collapse that have the destructive capacity in either raw materials or developed technology that can be used in weapons of mass destruction. In that environment, it is critical that while we combat terrorism, we do everything within our power to ensure that terrorists cannot gain access to any capacity to inflict mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">There can be no excuse or justification for terrorism, for State sponsorship of terrorism or States closing their eyes to the problem within their own borders. All manifestations of terrorism must be condemned, and we should deny any attempt to legitimize certain kinds of terrorism or to make the distinction between good terrorism and bad terrorism. The General Assembly and the Security Council consistently reaffirm this position.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa11">Religious and political leaders have a special responsibility to speak out against fanaticism and extremism. Terrorist movements indoctrinate their adherents -- often susceptible youth -- into believing that violence is the only means available to realize their goals. Some movements glorify martyrdom. We need to address incitement to violence at all levels, in the political sphere, in schools and in houses of worship.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa12">Combating terrorism is a difficult task, but one which no State, no matter how limited in resources or capacity, need tackle alone. Technical assistance in many fields is available through a number of international mechanisms, including the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. We applaud the work of these bodies and urge States to use and support these available resources.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa13">In conclusion, history tries to teach us a lesson that we too often forget. Appeasement, silence and neglect make a risky strategy in the face of danger. Instead, let each one of us do all we can to confront this threat. We should send a clear message through our actions that the nations of the world are resolved to eliminate terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Singapore.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Menon</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">I would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest condolences to our Indian colleagues as well as to all who lost loved ones in the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The attacks have shown that terrorism is a threat that spares no one. The fatalities from the attacks included more than 20 foreigners from at least nine countries. Singapore was also not left untouched by this tragedy. A Singaporean woman, killed in the Mumbai attacks, was the first Singaporean to fall victim to modern-day terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The tragic events in Mumbai are a grim reminder that the scourge of terrorism continues unabated. Singapore stands firmly behind the Indian Government in its fight against terrorism. It is equally if not even more important for countries in the South Asian region to work closely with one another to tackle a scourge that has cost countless lives and brought pain and suffering to all within the region. Not to do so would be to waste a golden opportunity and play into the very hands of those who seek to sow the seeds of discord among the peoples of the region.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">Seven years after the 11 September attacks and six years since the first bomb attacks in Bali, terrorism persists. The latest attacks in Mumbai, as well as the continued incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan, underscore the common terrorist threat that we continue to face.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">Terrorists continue to adapt and evolve. By decentralizing their networks, spawning independent home-grown groups and harnessing modern technology, they are making it that much more difficult for security authorities to detect and predict future attacks. We are also seeing more and more instances of plots or attacks involving self-radicalized individuals. These individuals are not recruited by any terrorist groups; they become exposed to deviant ideology, frequently through the Internet, and embrace the radical ideas they come across. They then facilitate, or worse, participate in, terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Singapore recognizes the diversity and constantly evolving nature of terrorism. The Singapore Government has adopted a multipronged strategy to deal with terrorism. The first element of this strategy is the use of a multi-ministry networked approach. Such an approach integrates the work of otherwise separate bodies, enables inter-agency coordination and allows the Government to leverage the strengths of diverse organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">The second element in our strategy is community engagement. Singapore is a multicultural and multireligious society; every community must play its part to hold society together during a crisis. Singapore's Prime Minister launched the Community Engagement Programme in February 2006. This Programme aims to strengthen understanding and develop trust among various ethnic communities and across society. The goal is to be able to maintain social harmony after any terrorist attack. A number of interfaith events, dialogues and forums have been held under the auspices of this Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">Singapore also relies heavily on members of all of its religious communities to help counter any misrepresentations of religion. For example, after several members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were apprehended for planning terrorist acts on Singaporean soil, our Muslim community stepped forward to help rehabilitate them. Muslim clerics from the Religious Rehabilitation Group work closely with the Singapore authorities to counsel the detainees and their families to correct their misinterpretation of Islam. The Religious Rehabilitation Group has also reached out to the wider community, both Muslim and non-Muslim, through forums and publications.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Another key element in our strategy is cooperation with the international community. Terrorism is a global problem and it obviously requires a global response. The United Nations continues to play an important role in sending a clear political signal that the international community's condemnation of terrorism in all of its forms and manifestations is consistent, unequivocal and strong. In this regard, Singapore welcomes the General Assembly's review of the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in September this year. Having assessed how far we have come and what else needs to be done, we should leave rhetoric aside and redouble our efforts to implement concrete counter-terrorism measures. Singapore is doing its part at the national and regional levels to implement the Strategy. We look forward to continued and closer cooperation with other Member States and to interacting with the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force to further enhance counter-terrorism efforts at the United Nations. Singapore also looks forward to further progress in discussions on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism at the upcoming ad hoc committee meetings during the current session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">Terrorism cuts across national, geographic, religious and ethnic boundaries. The transnational nature of modern-day terrorism means that all Governments will be faced with the challenge of confronting this menace. Terrorists seldom work in isolation and more often than not operate in well-organized networks of individuals, cells and groups around the world. The battle will be long-drawn-out. Modern-day terrorists have deep ideological roots and the adherents of these ideologies are prepared to go to extreme lengths to achieve their aims. Therefore, it is imperative that countries stay the course and continue to work closely to combat this scourge and exchange information on strategies to address the root causes of the issue. It is only through our combined efforts that we can hope to defeat the terrorist networks we are currently facing.</p>

	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01"> I now give the floor to the representative of Mexico.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Heller</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I would like to congratulate you, Sir, and the delegation of Croatia on convening this debate. We would also like to acknowledge the Croatian delegation's work in heading the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">First of all, we would like to express the solidarity and condolences of Mexico to the families of the victims and to the people and the Government of India for the tragic events of 26 November in Mumbai. We regret the loss of so many human lives, among them that of a Mexican citizen.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Terrorist attacks that have occurred in various regions of the world require us to redouble our efforts in international cooperation in combating terrorism, and we firmly reiterate our rejection of terrorist activity in any form or manifestation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Mexico would like to stress the central role of the Organization in combating terrorism and would recall the framework that is the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. However, its effectiveness will depend on the coordinated and comprehensive implementation of the Strategy, and that is based on its four pillars.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">I would like to refer to the human rights pillar. For my delegation, that is a central element in any activity to combat terrorism. Since 2001, Mexico has consistently urged that States ensure that the measures that they adopt to combat terrorism comply with their obligations with regard to international law, in particular those relating to human rights, refugees and humanitarian law. During our most recent term as a member of the Security Council in 2003, we supported the adoption of this approach in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. Some weeks ago, the Third Committee of the General Assembly took up this issue in a substantive way, and we hope that in the next few days the Assembly will adopt the resolution entitled "Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism".</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">In view of the intensification of communications in the globalized world in which we live, it is easy for terrorist organizations to use advanced technology and resources to achieve their objectives. For this reason, we consider the work of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> especially important, particularly the work to strengthen measures to detect and withhold financing for terrorist purposes. Also, we should prevent those organizations from having recourse to activities such as transnational organized crime, trafficking in illicit drugs, money-laundering and arms trafficking for their own purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">Mexico believes that it would be timely to strengthen cooperation among the Committees established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a>, as well as among the respective groups of experts, and to clarify differences in their mandates and activities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">Mexico is fully committed to combating terrorism. My country has actively participated in the drawing up of treaties on this issue and seeks to faithfully implement relevant Security Council resolutions. Mexico is a party to the 13 international legal instruments on terrorism and the two that exist in the inter-American sphere.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">We are especially concerned about the access terrorist organizations have to conventional weapons and the ease of that access due to the existing legal vacuums that promote illicit arms trafficking, constituting a threat to the security of many States. Additionally, combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is essential to preventing access to those weapons by terrorist organizations. Mexico recognizes the value of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1540 (2004)</a> in this regard, as well as the efforts made by States to achieve its full implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">Mexico believes that the United Nations should give priority to comprehensive strategies in combating terrorism in order to seek a lasting solution that deals with the causes of conflicts and corrects at their roots the impulses that lead to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">In this sense, the most effective actions against terrorism are those that promote economic and social development, because this scourge is not produced in a void. Its origins and development are linked to specific social, political and economic conditions, as well as to concrete historical conflicts that have not been resolved. It is in this framework that attempts are made to foment or justify terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">Also, specific and timely attention is necessary for humanitarian problems and promoting education and health in regions with the most severe structural problems in order to prevent the emergence and proliferation of terrorist organizations. For this reason, Mexico believes that for an effective fight against terrorism, the international community must maintain a comprehensive and coordinated strategy. Insofar as the international community can remain united, respecting its values and strengthening international cooperation, our chances of success will be better. We will fight terrorism while promoting, defending and ensuring respect for our own values.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01"> I now give the floor to the representative of Argentina.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Argüello</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I would first like to express Argentina's condemnation of the recent terrorist acts in Mumbai and its solidarity with the Government and people of India.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">I wish to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate. The subject is, I wish to stress, of the utmost importance for all States and for my country. I also wish to recognize Croatia for preparing the concept paper before us. It is very useful for today's debate in the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The Argentine Republic believes that international terrorist acts constitute a threat to peace and international security, to life and human dignity and to peaceful and civilized coexistence. They also endanger stability, democracy and the socio-economic development of nations. In recent years, my country suffered two brutal terrorist attacks, and we will not cease to seek and punish the perpetrators.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">An effective fight against terrorism necessarily entails the commitment of the whole international community, participating together organically and permanently, legitimized by the fact that that commitment is based on respect for general international law, international humanitarian law and international human rights law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Such organic and institutionalized participation to prevent and eliminate terrorism implies the direct involvement of the United Nations, in particular the General Assembly and the Security Council and its subsidiary organs, but also regional organizations. It also entails a two-fold commitment by individual States. On the one hand, they should become parties to the international instruments negotiated to confront terrorism, among which we emphasize the importance of the United Nations conventions. On the other hand, they should adopt domestic laws necessary to fully comply with such instruments.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">I wish to report that my country has ratified the 12 United Nations conventions on terrorism and has enacted the domestic measures stipulated by those instruments. It has also ratified the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism and signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Nuclear Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">At the national level, the Argentine Penal Code was amended in 2007 so as to incorporate the crime of illicit terrorist association. We have also amended Law 25.246, which created the Unit for Financial Information, and entrusted that Unit with the examination, treatment and transmission of information related to the laundering of the assets produced by the activities of an illicit terrorist group and the financing of terrorism. In the context of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, my country adopted the National Agenda for the Fight against Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">My country gives priority to the fight against terrorism also at the regional level, in the Organization of American States (OAS) and MERCOSUR. In the case of MERCOSUR, Argentina actively participates in its working groups on terrorism. As regards to the OAS, we participate in the activities of its Inter-American Committee against Terrorism. We also participate in the informal mechanism of the 3+1 Group on Tri-Border Area Security, composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">As stated in the draft presidential statement to be adopted at the end of this debate, Argentina believes that Member States must work together urgently to prevent and suppress terrorist acts, while at the same time it emphasizes the central role of the United Nations in the global fight against terrorism. We reaffirm the importance of all Security Council resolutions and those of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Finally, Argentina reiterates its call, already expressed, and as the President of the Security Council will do on this occasion, to States to become parties, as soon as possible, to all international instruments dealing with terrorism and to implement those to which they are party. Likewise, we join in firmly condemning the incitement to commit terrorist acts and repudiate any attempt to justify such acts, as that could incite the commission of other terrorist acts.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Turkey.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. lkin</span> <span class="nation">Turkey</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I wish to thank Croatia for taking the initiative to organize this open debate on such an important issue. I would also like to thank His Excellency the President of Croatia for presiding over this morning's part of our meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">In fact, terrorism is already one of the most discussed topics at the United Nations. There is every reason for that, since terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. Indeed, it concerns all nations, large and small, and it takes its toll on human beings of every age, culture, religion and nationality.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">In other words, we all are vulnerable to this global scourge. Thus, it requires a firm and united response by all Member States. And that is why we see each and every discussion on this issue, including today's debate, as useful in helping us to better understand various national and regional perspectives so as to find common ground for joint and more effective responses.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">In that regard, I would like to add my voice to those of previous speakers in strongly condemning all acts and practices of terrorism. Terrorism is a crime against humanity, and it can never be justified under any pretext, regardless of its motivations and objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">The recent heinous terrorist attack in the city of Mumbai underscored once again the importance of a firm commitment on the part of the international community to effectively combat and eradicate terrorism. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, who were targets of that monstrous crime against humanity. It once again underlined the fact that it is only through a coherent, consistent and resolute stance on the part of the international community that we can gain the upper hand against this scourge. We therefore hope that our debate today not only will send a strong message confirming our determination and unity in the fight against terrorism, but also can identify ways and means to further strengthen the central role of the United Nations in global counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">In fact, this Organization has already made some significant contributions to global counter-terrorism efforts, primarily through norm-setting and capacity-building. We commend those endeavours. However, we can by no means consider our mission accomplished. In the area of norm-setting, for instance, we ought to finalize, without further delay, our work on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism and present the international community with a comprehensive instrument that would further strengthen our efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">As regards capacity-building, on the other hand, the United Nations should continue to strengthen the facilitation of technical assistance aimed at enhancing the capabilities of Member States in the fight against terrorism. We must help those countries that are willing to shoulder their counter-terrorism obligations but lack the necessary resources and expertise to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">In that context, we note with appreciation certain steps taken, such as the recently introduced Preliminary Implementation Assessment mechanism, which is expected to identify areas in which countries need to take additional measures for the full and efficient implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">We also welcome the completion of the general survey of the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> by the Counter-Terrorism Committee, and we are looking forward to having the draft technical implementation guide that the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate is currently preparing. We hope that those initial steps will pave the way for the United Nations to play a more regulatory and guiding role in steering our counter-terrorism efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">That said, we need to work on developing a global monitoring mechanism that would not only identify threats and perpetrators in clear terms, but also highlight the weak and strong aspects of our implementation of the resolutions and agreements that we collectively underwrite. It is only through such central and effective monitoring and follow-up mechanisms that we will be able to fulfil our commitments and encourage tangible and substantive cooperation among Member States in a way that can create a synergy of efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">Turkey, as an advocate of strong international cooperation in the field of counter-terrorism, is ready and willing to contribute to all efforts to that end. In the light of our upcoming membership, we are also looking forward to actively and constructively participating in the counter-terrorism activities of the Security Council in the next two years by sharing our experiences and best practices on this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa12">Before concluding, allow me to briefly mention the Alliance of Civilizations initiative, which was launched in 2005 by the Secretary-General under the sponsorship of Turkey and Spain. The initiative, which is aimed at building bridges among diverse cultures and religions through our common values and ideals, could in fact be one of the most effective ways of dealing with all forms of extremism, including terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa13">Finally, we thank you once again, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. We are looking forward to working with you in strengthening the international community's fight against terrorism.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Azerbaijan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mehdiyev</span> <span class="nation">Azerbaijan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">At the outset, on behalf of my Government, I would like to commend the initiative of the Croatian presidency of the Security Council to hold this debate, which indeed offers a timely opportunity to engage in open deliberations with a view to strengthening international solidarity and the leading role of the United Nations in global counter-terrorism activities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">We remember all victims of terrorist acts and express our condolences to the people of India and the families of those who suffered as a result of the recent terrorist attacks on Mumbai. Azerbaijan strongly condemns terrorism as one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and is making sustained efforts to contribute to the international community's efforts aimed at consistent, comprehensive and coordinated responses to prevent and combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">In addition to the potential threats facing us as a result of our proximity to hotbeds of conflict and regions that harbour major terrorist groups and are sources of proliferation problems, Azerbaijan is a direct target of specific externally sponsored terrorist activity. Since the late 1980s, neighbouring Armenia openly encroached upon the territory of Azerbaijan and, in addition to launching combat operations there, resorted to deliberate terrorist attacks against my country's citizens and critical infrastructure as a way to implement its annexationist policy. In total, as a result of the terrorist acts against Azerbaijan, more than 2,000 of Azerbaijan's citizens have been killed, the majority of them women, elderly persons and children.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">Indeed, terrorism is closely related to aggressive separatism. Areas of armed conflict -- especially territories under foreign military occupation -- often create conditions conducive to exploitation by terrorists. Thus, the continuing occupation of a part of Azerbaijan's territory by Armenia provides fertile ground for terrorist and related activities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">Against that background, we are seriously concerned, inter alia, by the fact that conventional arms control mechanisms are not effective in such territories. The accumulation of a great number of armaments and ammunition there, beyond the reach of international control, poses a serious threat to regional peace and security. Our particular concern relates to the possibility of the use by terrorist groups of specific weapons, including individual anti-aircraft missile systems.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">Those trends have had an immediate impact on the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is no accident that Armenia's military expenditures, calculated in terms of gross domestic product, are among the highest in the world. We regret that members of the international community -- especially those mediating the negotiation process -- show a certain indifference to this problem, which in fact negatively affects the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the conflict as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">In this regard, we deem it necessary to take more efficient measures aimed at preventing those who are in effective military and political control of occupied territories from acquiring conventional weapons and to disclose their attempts to deny responsibility. Equally, reinforcement of existing non-proliferation mechanisms acquires additional significance and must be a serious part of the international effort.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">An important condition of counter-terrorist activity is that States refrain from organizing, financing, encouraging, providing, training or otherwise directly or indirectly supporting terrorist activities. Furthermore, insofar as international terrorist activities still rely on physical movement to reach another country in order to promote their messages and in certain instances to collect material resources, it is important that States take appropriate practical measures to ensure that their respective territories are not used for such activities, especially when they are aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">Terrorists must never be allowed to create a pretext for their actions. All terrorist acts constitute serious crimes; they are unjustifiable and unacceptable and must be unequivocally condemned and prosecuted.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">The absence of a clear definition of terrorism in international law merely hampers the efforts of the international community to bring not only individual terrorists and organizations to account, but also States that promote, support or finance terrorist activities. In this regard, Azerbaijan reiterates its determination to make every effort to reach an agreement on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism that will serve as an effective instrument to counter terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa11">The war on terrorism should not be used to target any particular religion or culture. Today, we are living at a time of heightened religious awareness, which in certain instances takes on exaggerated forms and sometimes is maliciously exploited to fuel conflicts on ethnic, religious or cultural grounds. In recent years, unacceptable attacks against Islam in some countries confirm the vital necessity of joint efforts and dialogue to counter such defamatory manifestations and misconceptions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa12">Constructive interaction between different cultures and religions, including in the framework of such initiatives as the culture of peace and the Alliance of Civilizations, should continue playing a special role in contributing to peace and mutual understanding and thus to the efficient implementation of counter-terrorism measures.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I call on the representative of the Republic of Korea.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park In-Kook</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">I would like to take this opportunity to strongly condemn the indiscriminate violence that struck Mumbai through a series of ugly and odious terrorist acts. On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Korea, I would also like to convey our deepest condolences to the victims, their families, the Government of India and its people. We wish the injured a speedy recovery.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Despite the strengthened efforts of the international community, terrorism has continued to plague countries across the globe and remains a great concern to the international community. It hinders the reconstruction and stabilization of war-torn countries and the well-being of all people. Further, the increasing links between terrorism and transnational crime are also alarming. Strengthening law enforcement in capturing and dismantling terrorist organizations and improving the capacity of States to prevent and combat terrorism are important elements in countering the threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">Moreover, addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism would contribute to strengthening the international response to the scourge of terrorism as underlined in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In this regard, measures such as the easing of socio-economic marginalization, the promotion of dialogue among civilizations and the integration of ethnic and religious minorities would complement the efforts of the international community to counter terrorism in a sustainable manner.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">Strongly convinced that terrorism should be eradicated regardless of its forms and motivations, the Republic of Korea is fully committed to preventing and combating acts of terrorism and its misguided extremist ideology. To this end, the Government of the Republic of Korea is actively participating in international efforts by faithfully implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">1267 (1999)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a>. It also joins other efforts such as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In order to effectively respond to terrorist threats, comprehensive and systematic counter-terrorism efforts are required at the global level. In this regard, the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy offers a solid basis for international counter-terrorism cooperation. The Republic of Korea strongly supports the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the complete implementation of the four pillars of the Strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">The Strategy also emphasizes coordinated joint efforts by encouraging Member States and international and regional organizations to support its implementation through mobilizing resources and expertise. The harmonization of counter-terrorism measures and the exchange of best practices of various regions and Member States is an important element in the effort to cope with terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">It is time now to make another serious attempt, together with the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, to adopt a comprehensive convention on international terrorism that would reinforce the legal network to prevent international terrorism. In an effort to strengthen legal instruments, it is also essential for all Member States to become party to the relevant international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism and to assist each other in doing so. In this regard, the Republic of Korea has ratified 12 United Nations counter-terrorism conventions and signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">The United Nations actions to counter terrorism are continuously evolving to adapt to constantly changing threats. The United Nations concentrates its efforts on devising a harmonized international framework that ensures effectiveness, efficiency and continuous improvement. The United Nations should keep playing a central role in these well established mechanisms of international counter-terrorism cooperation. Greater interaction and complementary cooperation between the Security Council and the General Assembly should be continuously promoted to ensure synergy in the efforts of the United Nations to counter the threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai and frequent attacks elsewhere in the world have demonstrated only too clearly that terrorism is an indiscriminate affront to universal values and civilizations. Terrorism cannot be linked to a particular nationality, religion, civilization or culture. It is simply a common threat we are facing, which requires solidarity in the international community.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I call on the representative of the Philippines.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Davide</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">Tomorrow we celebrate the commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Only last 24 October, we also celebrated the sixty-third anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Charter. Above all measures, these are historic milestones for the United Nations and are events of unparalleled significance.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">One of the purposes of the Charter is to maintain international peace and security and to that end, inter alia, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. In its preamble, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world and that disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts that have outraged the conscience of mankind. These rights include the rights to life, liberty and security.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">There can be no doubt at all that terrorist acts are threats to international peace and security. Hence, the holding of this debate on the agenda item "Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts" is certainly very timely and appropriate. Thus, the Philippines commends and expresses its gratitude to the President of the Security Council for organizing this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">More than enough has been said and recorded in the United Nations system on terrorism. The latest comprehensive report of the Secretary-General under agenda item 118 of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session, entitled "United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy: activities of the United Nations system in implementing the Strategy" (<a href="../pdf/A-62-898.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/898</a>), shows us the complexity of the problems created by international terrorism as it affects international peace and security; the progress made thus far in combating it; and the measures recommended to be pursued to prevent or counter terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">In my speech at the tenth annual International Judicial Conference, held in Strasbourg, France, in May 2002 under the sponsorship of the Center for Democracy, the Council of Europe and the Furth Family Foundation, I asserted that we must resist the temptation to attribute to terrorism some kind of mythic magnitude that makes it larger than life. I told the audience that terrorism is man-made; therefore, it can be solved by men and women of resolve.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">Today, I say that there is one body that is much greater than the men and women of resolve. It is the United Nations, with its 192 Member States. Not only does it have the resolve, it has the will, the power, the might and the resources to counter and solve terrorism and to demolish, if it wishes to, every act of terrorism in any part of the globe. With the deadly tentacles of terrorism spreading over many places, the latest of which was Mumbai, India, the United Nations must now more than ever assert its power and might.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">For this debate, allow me to contribute a few thoughts on how the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, can move further forward in this fight against terrorism from the legal and judicial perspectives, with which I have some familiarity.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">I respectfully submit, as I did at the Strasbourg Conference I mentioned earlier, that there should now be a universally accepted definition of terrorism and a condemnation thereof as a crime, with a recognition of the criminal intent of fomenting fear and terror. I find in the report of the Secretary-General, referred to earlier, that there is an Ad Hoc Committee, established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a> of 17 December 1996, that is tasked with drafting a comprehensive convention on international terrorism and is ably supported by the Office of Legal Affairs. While having achieved some progress, the Committee is finding some disagreements among Member States regarding the scope of the convention, and attempts will be made to resolve them in the Sixth Committee during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. The convention could be the proper document for the definition of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">At that same Conference, I also stated that the United Nations lost its first opportunity to establish a definition of the crime of terrorism when the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was deliberated upon and approved by 160 Member States. Moreover, the Statute could even have included terrorism as one of the crimes recognized by the Court.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">I hope that the Security Council and the General Assembly can do something to expedite the adoption of the convention on terrorism, which is still in the drawing board of the Ad Hoc Committee. Likewise, I wish to reiterate here the proposal I made before the same Strasbourg Conference for national legislatures to enact laws defining and punishing terrorism as a crime. It could be treated as a crime in violation of the law of nations. This would have two legal consequences. First, it would make applicable the doctrine of universal jurisdiction. Secondly, it would provide for concurrent jurisdictions between international courts and domestic courts and allow the latter to yield jurisdiction to international courts according to treaty obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">The Philippines has already enacted a law, the Human Security Act of 2007, defining and penalizing two crimes: first, terrorism; and secondly, conspiracy to commit terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa12">Finally, allow me to state that among the strong and effective deterrents to the commission of crimes are the expeditious prosecution and trial of cases against the offenders and the rendition of just, fair and impartial judgement. Delays in the prosecution, trials and judgement of terrorists would send wrong signals to them and their co-conspirators. It would either embolden them to assert their strength and make a mockery of the weakness of the processes aligned against them, or give them reason to claim that their comrades in detention are deprived of due process and then instigate an escalation in their terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa13">Things would have been entirely different if, for example, there had been expeditious prosecution and trials and the meting of justice to terrorists involved in the 9/11 tragedy and similar tragedies. Continuous trials of these cases must be adopted as a standard practice. In this regard, the United Nations must do something.</p>

	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Jordan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Allaf</span> <span class="nation">Jordan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank the Permanent Representative of Croatia for holding this important meeting. We would like to welcome his role in chairing the Counter-Terrorism Committee, an auxiliary body of the Security Council. We appreciate the concept paper that was presented by the President as a basis for the Council's work in today's meeting. We would like to thank His Excellency the President of Croatia for his presence.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">Allow me also, on behalf of His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein and the Government and people of Jordan, to present our sincere condolences to the people of India for the terrible suffering that they have endured after the reprehensible terrorist attacks in Mumbai. We condemn these despicable acts in the strongest terms. We express our deep sympathy to the bereaved families of the victims and reiterate our solidarity with these families during this trying time.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">The Mumbai terrorist acts sought to send a clear and strong signal to people throughout the world that terrorism is not simply a threat to international peace and security and that it is no longer confined to political, psychological and material damages, but that it also seeks to make itself a crucial actor on the international scene, to participate in defining the security environment throughout the world and to impose its personality and fingerprints on regional conflicts.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">We think that the message got through. This message causes great concern to people throughout the world. It raises essential questions in terms of the future of combating terrorism. An important question is: Should we take it that the Mumbai incident is a strategic turning point, inasmuch as it pushes extremism and evil into bilateral and regional conflicts? Also, through these forces, is terrorism then trying to reach its objectives with a minimum degree of visibility, of losses and of responsibility? This message requires a serious reply from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">This step requires a strategic transformation on our part. Our political will and that of the international community and international organizations must be brought to bear on it. We must transform our vision of terrorism and our determination to defeat it. We must transform our reading of the magnitude, scope and depth of the threat posed by terrorism to the international community, human values and the prosperity of societies. We must also bolster our determination to establish the appropriate political, security and social environment necessary to defeat terrorism. Lastly, there is a need to harmonize the resolve of the international community, which is at the heart of that vision.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">It is illogical and unacceptable that international terrorism can adapt, renew itself and manoeuvre while the international community continues to be held hostage to slow bureaucracies in combating it due to its insufficient determination and indecisive tools. In his concept paper, the President cited some of the serious bureaucratic difficulties that constitute serious obstacles in the face of the scope and dynamism of terrorist acts and highlight our ineffectiveness to combat them. We recognize the great strategic value of counter-terrorism and its importance as a basis for international efforts. However, the structure of our global strategy must be adapted and its ability to respond quickly must be enhanced. That is the only way to achieve the goals of counter-terrorism at the level of this international Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">The current situation therefore calls for calm and reason, and not for tension, hasty action or misguided decisions. The policy of escalation will only serve the interests of terrorists, who are wagering on such a policy. We must therefore avoid escalation. My country supports the wise efforts that have been made to demonstrate restraint and reason. Those efforts reflect the will of the international community and its determination to avoid more regional confrontations, which undermine international peace and security and divert counter-terrorism from its real objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">Jordan itself is a long-standing victim of terrorism. We have taken pioneering steps to support international efforts to combat terrorism and have always been an important part of the partnership to that end. We have signed most of the international agreements and protocols that constitute the international counter-terrorism regime. Jordan has also developed a national strategy to combat terrorism that serves as an example of the balance that must exist between the need to provide security and protect society, on the one hand, and the need to safeguard human rights, civil liberties, the rule of law and social and economic development, on the other. That sensitive balance allows us to avert the effects of terrorism and to achieve great harmony between the Government and the people in combating terrorism. We are confident that our success in combating terrorism depends on more than just deterrence, security measures and a professional military. Our strategic vision also encompasses other crucial elements, such as legal, financial, economic and social ways of combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">Jordan has also been a pioneer in promoting the culture of peace. We have undertaken several initiatives and established numerous programmes that emphasize education about and awareness of the dangers of terrorism in order to enable us to devise policies to confront extremism and encourage dialogue among religions and civilizations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">Combating terrorism is a joint international responsibility. No single State can be successful in combating terrorism if it isolates itself from international efforts. We are certain that genuine partnership and effective international cooperation in the framework of the United Nations hold the real key to the success of our efforts. Jordan therefore strongly supports the central role played by the United Nations in combating terrorism. We similarly support strengthening the capacity of this international Organization, including its determination to play an effective and constructive role. We shall continue to meet our international responsibilities in the context of that partnership, the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and multilateral international conventions pertaining to the danger posed by terrorism. The Government of Jordan has always taken a positive stance on the working methods of the Security Council, which reflects our seriousness and responsibility vis-à-vis the threat of terrorism. It also reflects the importance that we attach to international cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my country's determination to abide by the international partnership to combat terrorism as established by the Security Council standards.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Viotti</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I would like to commend you, Mr. President, for convening this timely debate, which is an eloquent expression of the importance that your Government attaches to the fight against terrorism. The statement delivered by the President of Croatia, whose presence in the Chamber this morning we appreciated very much, serves as a great contribution to our joint consideration of this very important matter. I should also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his presentation. My delegation is grateful for his efforts to stimulate and support multilateral cooperation against threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">In recent days, the world has once again been shocked by a series of deadly terrorist acts, this time in India. Allow me to reiterate our deep condolences and heartfelt sympathy to the Government and people of India and to the families of the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">The boldness and savagery shown in Mumbai remind us that the international community must stand together and work harder to prevent such events from recurring. Those responsible for the killing and destruction must be brought to justice without delay, so that there can be no doubt that the lives of civilians will be protected and the rule of law will prevail against the criminals who wish them ill.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">There is no possible justification for terrorism. Killing innocent civilians is never acceptable. That is why Brazil strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. More than a position of successive Governments, the repudiation of terrorism is enshrined in the federal Constitution itself as a guiding principle of Brazilian foreign policy.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">My country is also a party to all international conventions and protocols against terrorism, except for the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which is under consideration by the National Congress.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">Acts such as those seen in Mumbai must be met with our resolute willingness to deepen our cooperation, as envisaged in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Strategy is particularly relevant because it promotes responses to terrorism that are comprehensive, coordinated and consistent. Many of its elements make it clear that it is an instrument of justice, peace and order and not of vengeance, discrimination or blind attachment to the status quo.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">It is therefore crucial to combat terrorism in strict observance of international law. Only procedures adopted in accordance with the United Nations Charter and other relevant treaties, in particular human rights instruments and international humanitarian and refugee law, can be truly successful and garner the necessary support. Those procedures are essential to preserve the moral standing of Governments fighting terrorism and to win the battle where victory is most needed -- in the hearts and minds of those whom terrorists claim to defend but in fact threaten, hurt and often kill.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">Further developing international law can only help to fight terrorism effectively. Brazil strongly supports the adoption of a comprehensive counter-terrorism convention. We will continue to contribute to the negotiations and efforts to achieve our common goal. We hope that substantial results can be achieved shortly and that a high-level conference on the matter can be convened.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">Another essential element of our collective struggle is enhanced judicial cooperation and exchange of information among States, especially among financial and police intelligence agencies. In that regard, the counter-terrorism committees of the Security Council have played an outstanding role. Their working methods have been improved in recent years so as to make them more effective while respecting basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. The committees constitute a valuable tool to ensure a coordinated response from the international community to the threats posed by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">Although indispensable, repression is not enough to put an end to terrorism. Prevention is key if we want to rid the planet of such a scourge. We must eliminate or at least mitigate non-material factors that may breed terrorist acts, including political, ethnic, racial, cultural and religious intolerance. Education for peace and diversity has become a necessity, and a particularly urgent one in some quarters of the globe, East and West. But such an urgent task is to be performed by all, everywhere and at all times. At the international level, initiatives such as the Alliance of Civilizations are most welcome because they help to bridge the gap between different cultures. They promote mutual understanding, tolerance and the broad acceptance of different world views.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">Preventing terrorism also requires addressing the social and economic divide among and within nations. We all know that terrorists thrive there where underdevelopment, poverty and hopelessness make extremism look like the only avenue open to real change. As President Lula has forcefully advocated since he first came to office, the international community must take decisive action to help Governments combat hunger and poverty worldwide. It is an obvious but often disregarded truth that those who feel included and cared for have a stake in the preservation of the social and political order that supports them.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">In light of the above, Mr. President, my delegation cannot but join our voice to your Excellency's call for a multidimensional approach against terrorism that does not shy away from the use of force whenever necessary and at the same time fully understands the absolute need to address the powerful causes that make many choose extremism and violence. The right combination of strict law enforcement and broad inclusiveness will eventually lead us to success.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Ecuador.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Morejón</span> <span class="nation">Ecuador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">Allow me to thank you, Mr. President, for placing this open debate on the Security Council's programme in order to apprise us of the Council's efforts with regard to threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. There is no doubt that this type of public meeting and the growing interaction of the Council and its subsidiary bodies with non-member States are important efforts in the common goal of the Organization to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">On behalf of the Government of Ecuador, I join other delegations in expressing our most sincere condolences to the Government and people of India in connection with the reprehensible attacks in Mumbai.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">Ecuador attaches great importance to the role of the United Nations in establishing a global order based on respect for international law, the principles and norms set out in the Charter and the observance and promotion of human rights and international humanitarian law. In that regard, my country supports the efforts of the United Nations to address the serious security problems we face -- including combating terrorism, the global drug problem and transnational organized crime -- by implementing the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We also support efforts to strengthen cooperation with the Security Council Committees established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">In accordance with the new Constitution of Ecuador, adopted this year by a large majority, my country shall undertake additional reforms in the criminal, banking and customs areas that will facilitate the implementation of counter-terrorism measures, in particular the financing of terrorism. The national Government has also been working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on a proposed reform to the criminal code.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">At the same time, Ecuador has installed information technology in its ports and airports and strengthened its cooperation with international organizations, including Interpol, to share information on the movement of those suspected of transnational crimes and to prevent the international trafficking of arms, explosives, hazardous goods and chemical precursors. The country's security agencies are continuously updating the consolidated list on Al-Qaida and the Taliban and associated persons and entities. Finally, with regard to transport security, Ecuador applies international standards for the security of air and maritime transport.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">The implementation of Plan Ecuador represents to the international community our ongoing desire to address the problems of unconventional security issues from a different perspective as our concrete national and sovereign contribution to building peace in our border regions and the Andean subregion. We have enhanced our control operations along the border, leading to the dismantling of more than 160 clandestine camps of irregular groups, including rest posts and temporary drug-processing labs, and to the capture of arms and communications equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">Ecuador is the largest host for Colombian refugees in Latin America. In order to address that situation, together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees we have implemented clear standards and humanitarian procedures for processing asylum requests so as to grant refugee status only to those who comply with the parametres established in our national legal instruments and international law.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, my delegation is very interested in the statements made in this debate by various delegations, especially on the issue of the causes of terrorism. We believe it necessary to stress the importance of cooperation being aimed not only at strengthening national counter-terrorism capacities, which of course is critical but does not take into account the fact that, as stated in the Strategy, the fight against terrorism includes the fight against poverty and social inequality. That in turn requires international cooperation in the implementation of national policies to achieve sustained economic and social development through dialogue and inclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">We have spent many years and engaged in numerous deliberations on the ways to eliminate international terrorism. We therefore urge all States to overcome their differences and allow progress to be made on the relevant instruments, whose entry into force is imperative to strengthening counter-terrorism mechanisms.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Austria.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayr-Harting</span> <span class="nation">Austria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">At the outset, Austria would like to thank the Croatian presidency of the Security Council for this very timely and important initiative.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">We express our solidarity and deep sympathy with the victims of the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai and their families. These heinous attacks amply demonstrate the need for a multilateral approach and confirm the pivotal role of the United Nations at the centre of our joint counter-terrorism efforts, as was stressed this morning by the Secretary-General in his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">Austria aligns itself with the statement of the French presidency on behalf of the European Union. I will thus limit my intervention to highlighting three points to which Austria attaches particular importance.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">First, respect for human rights and the rule of law is a fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. Effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing. On the one hand, the development of an effective and rule of law-based national system of law enforcement and criminal justice is an essential element in preventing terrorist acts and in bringing terrorists to justice. On the other hand, we all must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with our obligations under international law, in particular human rights law, refugee law and international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">We welcome the steps taken by the Security Council and its subsidiary bodies in this regard, including the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, under the able chairmanship of Croatia, and its Executive Directorate in addressing human rights aspects of counter-terrorism in the context of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as well as the efforts of the sanctions Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, ably chaired by Belgium, and its Monitoring Team to strengthen the procedures for listing and de-listing individuals and entities, in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">I would like to remind the Council of the report of Austrian initiative on the Security Council and the rule of law. As recommended in that report, it is important that the Security Council be proactive in further improving fair and clear procedures to protect the rights of individuals affected by its decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">My second point is that, in order to succeed, our counter-terrorism efforts require an integrated, balanced and multidimensional approach, covering a broad range of both hard and soft measures. For instance, it is essential to strengthen coordination and cooperation in combating crimes that are connected with terrorism, such as organized crime, human trafficking, drugs trafficking and the illicit arms trade. At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism and promote a culture of peace, mutual respect and tolerance, including through dialogue among religions and civilizations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">Combating the incitement of terrorist acts, radicalization and recruitment of terrorists, especially through the Internet, remains one of our key challenges. In that regard, we stress the need for full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1624 (2005)</a>. Finally, we must further encourage active involvement of civil society, including the media, victims' organizations and the private sector in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">Third, and finally, as was explicitly recognized in the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Strategy, capacity-building is a core element of the global counter-terrorism effort. Many States lack the legal and organizational framework to effectively combat terrorism. Our key challenge is to support States by providing technical assistance to strengthen their capacity to prevent, to protect their citizens from and to respond to, terrorist attacks. In this context, Austria calls on the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate to intensify their very important efforts in facilitating assistance, and on the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime -- which has so far provided technical assistance to more than 150 States -- to further enhance its successful activities to develop the capacity of States.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">Let me say once again that Austria warmly welcomes this open debate and the adoption of a presidential statement today. That will send a strong message to the world that we all stand united to overcome the global threat of terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I next give the floor to the ambassador of New Zealand.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Banks</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">New Zealand joins other Member States in strong condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai. We repeat here our condolences to India for the tragic losses it suffered, as well as to those countries whose nationals were also affected.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">The Mumbai attacks were a reminder that in spite of some significant successes in recent years, the scourge of international terrorism persists. There continue to be too many victims of terrorism in too many places. New Zealand remains unequivocal in our condemnation, in the strongest possible terms, of terrorism in all its forms.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">The terrorism we face today is a global phenomenon and as such requires a coordinated global response. The spread of terrorist attacks and the globalization of terrorist networks confirm that no region or country can be complacent when it comes to taking measures to combat terrorism. The United Nations, through the work of the General Assembly, the Security Council and its Committees and other bodies, is best placed to coordinate the global response.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">New Zealand supported the adoption of the United Nations Global Strategy on Counter-Terrorism, and we work together with other Member States, particularly those in our region, to advance our collective efforts to implement the Strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Equally important is the need for ongoing improvements in the implementation of the key Security Council resolutions on counter-terrorism -- <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a>. We support the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate in this regard. Next year, we look forward to welcoming a visit to New Zealand by officials from the Executive Directorate to discuss implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in New Zealand and in our region.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">There is a high level of commonality between the principles under the four pillars of the Global Strategy and those that guide New Zealand's approach to counter-terrorism domestically and within our region. Domestically, we remain determined to take all necessary measures to prevent and combat terrorism to ensure that our country is neither a target nor a source for terrorist activity. We continue to improve our legislative, policy and operational capabilities. Regional bodies too play a key role in coordinating responses to terrorism. We wish to draw attention to the statements unequivocally condemning terrorist acts made by leaders and ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economies at their annual meeting in Lima last month. Leaders reiterated that terrorist acts can never be justified or excused and reaffirmed their collective commitment to eliminating the threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">New Zealand has been actively engaged in our region, building the capacity of partner countries to counter the threat of terrorism. We continue to help Pacific island countries meet the requirements of the international counter-terrorism agenda. We have been encouraged by the progress made in improving counter-terrorism legislation, policy and operational capability in the Pacific. In South-East Asia, New Zealand continues to support a number of counter-terrorism capacity-building initiatives both bilaterally with key partners and regionally through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">The threat of international terrorism requires a comprehensive, multilayered and long-term response. Complementing our wider counter-terrorism efforts, New Zealand has also funded initiatives aimed at addressing the conditions that are conducive to the spread of terrorism through a programme of counter-radicalization activities.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">Thank you, Mr. President, for Croatia's leadership on this fundamental issue and for the opportunity presented by today's debate to reaffirm New Zealand's steadfast commitment to combat and prevent terrorism.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate. We appreciate the participation of His Excellency the President of Croatia in this important discussion. His presence, as well as renewed interest in this debate, signifies the importance of this subject in today's context.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">The threat to international peace and security caused by terrorism has serious consequences for humanity. It debases the traditional ethos on which States and societies are founded. Most importantly, it denies people their basic rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">Terrorism has assumed international dimensions through a mix of destructive transnational networks. Those networks hum with activities like fundraising, trafficking in people, drugs and illicit arms, including weapons with possible mass-destruction capabilities. They propagate hate literature and other forms of transnational subversion. As a former United Nations Secretary General once put it, the growing nexus between these activities, including through the dynamics of globalization, could constitute a supranational subversive threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">The debate is also timely and topical. The world has barely recovered from the shock of recent terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in Mumbai, the commercial hub of our neighbour and friend, India. As a country that has suffered much from such terrorism, Sri Lanka has conveyed to the Government and people of India our sympathy and solidarity.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">More terror attacks on more places in many of our countries continue on a daily basis. The orgy of attacks has led to the death and injury of numerous innocent civilians. This is in addition to enormous losses to infrastructure and economies. These types of attacks by terrorists, whether they are from within the region or outside -- or even from within our own countries, including mine, where one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in the world, the so-called Tigers, remains a threat -- demonstrate the growing transnational dimension of this scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">Terrorists are emboldened by such so-called tactical successes as these and, as the Secretary-General said this morning, they get carried away by the publicity won for whichever cause they espouse. They then become intransigent at the negotiating table and brazenly walk out of peace talks when Governments offer negotiable compromises as democratic solutions at negotiations. Then they go international -- ideologically, diplomatically and financially. This is exactly the situation engendered by today's so-called Tiger terrorism in Sri Lanka and abroad, after almost 25 years of efforts by successive elected Governments to negotiate political solutions. This situation requires a robust deterrent response to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) brand of terrorism and political solutions to its root causes. That is Sri Lanka's approach to the issue under discussion.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">Democracies today have become especially vulnerable to terrorism and its international manifestations. The basic guarantees of fundamental rights and freedoms, as well as the political space available to different actors in a democracy are increasingly exploited and constrained by terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">The Security Council has addressed the threat of terrorism in its different resolutions, particularly <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a>. The Council remains preoccupied with Al-Qaida, the Taliban and associated groups, against which specific targeted measures have been taken through listing, naming and shaming. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, on the other hand, provides a common framework for international cooperation in taking specific and comprehensive measures against terrorism irrespective of the type of perpetrator of such atrocious acts. The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the Executive Directorate, as well as other multilateral mechanisms and several international legal instruments relevant to combating terrorism, can be synergized through the Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Such collective action would provide an appropriate architecture for harnessing global efforts to combat and eliminate this clear and present threat to peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">It is high time that we galvanized all these mechanisms and measures into concrete actions against individuals and entities engaged in terrorism, without seeking to discriminate between terrorist groups on the basis of their real or assumed cause or grievance. As we have learned painfully over the years in different places, from Mumbai to Karachi and from Colombo to New York, no cause or concern justifies terrorism. The common goal of such brutal violence is annihilation and destruction -- the antithesis of what the United Nations and international community stand for.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">Concrete actions should be taken on several fronts. They should be multidimensional, interconnected and coordinated. Such actions should range from technical surveillance of potential acts of terrorism at the planning stages, focused on the entities or their front organizations, to the prevention and interdiction of illicit trafficking of people, arms, ammunition and other offensive material. This should be done at the supply end as well, not relying solely on action at the receiving end, which is the case at present in most situations. While a comprehensive legal regime and reasonable implementation mechanisms against terrorist fundraising and financing do exist, there is not yet a robust and functional tracking and interdiction system in place against the acquisition and transportation by air or sea of offensive assets deployable by terrorist groups that are banned worldwide. The interdiction and non-proliferation systems that exist for weapons of mass destruction are either unable or unwilling to be harnessed for what is clearly an equally dangerous threat to international peace and security: the free movement of terrorist hardware across frontiers, on the high seas and now by air.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">Some terrorist groups, like the Tigers in Sri Lanka, have audaciously acquired aviation capability, indicating their intention to become a regional hub for weapons trafficking. There should be more determined mutual assistance and international cooperation to ensure that terrorist groups do not acquire such transnational capabilities, whether through diaspora assistance or geopolitical manipulations.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">In 2006, the Security Council adopted an important resolution with a view to making its coverage of terrorism more inclusive. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1566 (2004)</a> requires urgent attention and action by the Council and other Members of the United Nations to build upon its specific focus on individuals and groups other than those covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. The resolution calls for the identification of specific measures against such groups, which, in our view, also include internationally banned groups such as the LTTE. It is hoped that the Working Group established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1566(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1566 (2004)</a> will address the critical issues with the attention they deserve.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa13">Along with other Members of the United Nations, Sri Lanka finds it timely to urge the Council to devote more effort to balancing its current counter-terrorism focus in order to provide a more comprehensive approach to the security dimension of the terrorism challenge. Only such an approach, which does not discriminate among terrorist groups, will enable Member States and the international community to take decisive measures against the perpetrators of terrorism in a coherent and coordinated manner.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa14">Conceived in cold blood and executed uncompromisingly, the ruthless attacks in India, which we have condemned unreservedly, are a pointer to how the agents of terror, both external and home-grown, are fine-tuning their strategies and tactics. This coordination reveals a dangerous trend of cooperation among such networks at all levels -- national, subregional, regional and international -- and thereby confronts us with the expanding prospect of the globalization of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa15">Collective, coherent and resolute action through international cooperation is therefore imperative. This is necessary so that terror groups like the LTTE do not seek and abuse the cover of ceasefires to acquire and operate illegal merchant fleets under flags of convenience, as they do now, in order to transport weapons and build commercial networks with other terror groups such as Al-Qaida, as the London International Institute for Strategic Studies has reported for several years now.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa16">Such international cooperation could have prevented the LTTE, for example, from abusing a long-standing ceasefire to illegally acquire an aviation capability that can threaten stability and security abroad while undermining democratic conflict-resolution processes at home. The policy and legal regimes of Council resolutions such as <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> should be given more functional teeth. There is no time more demanding than today to prove that we are equal to that task. We therefore welcome your efforts, Sir, and the draft presidential statement of the Council in that regard.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I call on the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khazaee</span> <span class="nation">Iran</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Allow me to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the Council's presidency this month and thanking you for having convened this important debate on the daunting impact of terrorism on international security. We hope that this debate will help revitalize and strengthen international solidarity to combat this threat under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">There is no need to stress the fact that terrorism remains one of the most serious threats and challenges that the world community is facing today. We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Undoubtedly, the collective fight against this menace continues to remain a high priority on the agenda of the international community, with the United Nations at the forefront and playing a central role in that regard. The elimination of terrorism will be possible only through collective and coordinated international efforts led by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">The recent brutal terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which we once again strongly condemn, served as a reminder to all that terrorists are relentless in their vicious efforts and in resorting to their heinous criminal and terrorist acts to inflict pain and suffering on various peoples and to strain relations among nations. Also, the latest atrocious terrorist attacks in Pakistan have been equally condemned and indicate that terrorism knows no boundaries and that terrorists strike whenever and wherever they can and as their vicious aims so require.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">We have all acknowledged and emphasized the important contribution that the United Nations counter-terrorism mechanisms can and should make to our collective efforts to fight terrorism. Based upon that belief, my Government has committed itself to cooperate with those mechanisms and in that context has so far presented five national reports to the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">Apart from the numerous measures taken by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in line with the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and other relevant resolutions on terrorism, which are described in the said reports, Iran has adopted and has put into force the anti-money-laundering act that was subject to thorough deliberations prior to its adoption by the Parliament. We have also augmented and intensified practical arrangements to ensure, among other things, the safety and security of our borders with neighbouring countries. Iran's costly fight against the drug traffickers who originate in Afghanistan is another aspect of our serious contribution to the fight against terrorism and its feeding grounds.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">Iran has also taken serious steps in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and other Council resolutions on Al-Qaida and the Taliban. As one of the first victims of the Taliban's terrorism and as a nation that has endured the bitter results of the terrorism perpetrated by terrorist groups such as Jundullah, that is said to be affiliated with Al-Qaida and the Taliban, Iran has strong interest and unwavering determination in the fight against terrorism and in contributing to the United Nations efforts in that important fight.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">Our nation is still experiencing profound sorrow and grief after having learned that 15 of its brave and beloved soldiers who were abducted by the Jundullah terrorist group have been slaughtered by the said terrorist group in a heinous and brutal way a few days ago. The perpetrators of that terrorist act must be brought to justice and the cooperation of the international community is essential in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">To yield the expected results, the fight against terrorism should be genuine, non-political, non-selective and resolute. Associating any nation, religion or culture with terrorism is a wrong -- and in many cases politically motivated -- move that risks further shattering the international consensus in fighting the threat. Regrettably, there have been certain unwarranted and unacceptable efforts on the part of a few Powers aimed at hijacking the fight against terrorism and using it as a means to pursue their own political agendas. They have been unjustifiably using the term "terrorism" to tarnish the image of nations that may pursue a political outlook different from those of the said few Powers.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">That trend, if not checked and reversed, will lead to a decline in international support for the fight against terrorism and result in destroying the international consensus which is indispensable for that fight. There should be no doubt that terrorism is a threat that comes from no specific religion or culture, but threatens and targets all countries, religions and cultures.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">Applying double standards in fighting terrorism and terrorist groups is yet another matter of grave concern which negatively affects the international community's collective campaign against terrorism. On the one hand, we witness that the legitimate struggle of peoples under occupation for self-determination and national liberation -- a right enshrined in international law and the Charter -- is sometimes unfairly and falsely equated with terrorism. On the other, the massacre of people remaining under occupation, such as the criminal and terrorist acts of the Israeli regime against the people under its brutal occupation, goes unpunished or is even supported by certain Powers. Some terrorist groups such as the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MKO) terrorist cult, that only live to kill innocent people and are clear examples of terrorism, are tolerated, sheltered or even supported by the same Powers.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">In the course of the past three decades, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been subjected to different acts of terrorism by terrorist groups such as the MKO terrorist cult. That terrorist and criminal group has long been stationed in Iraq and has planned, financed, supervised and perpetrated terrorist operations within and outside Iran against the Iranian nation and peoples of other countries. Their acts of terrorism have thus far resulted in the killing of many Iranian civilians and officials and have damaged private and Government properties.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">That notorious, callous and wicked terrorist cult was long supported and sheltered by the regime of Saddam Hussein. It fought against our nation alongside the previous Iraqi regime and worked as one of the main killing machines of Saddam Hussein against the Iraqi people, particularly Kurds and others. Currently, the few remaining members of that terrorist cult continue to maintain their military capabilities as well as their terrorist nature, structure, aims and malicious founding principles and are still involved in various forms of terrorism and criminal activities.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa13">Despite its heinous terrorist and cultish nature and in spite of all its brutal terrorist activities, many members of that terrorist cult, which was designated a terrorist entity by the United States and the European Union (EU), continue to be sheltered in the United States and Europe, plotting their malicious terrorist plans against our nation. Undoubtedly, double standards and selectivity in fighting terrorism as well as political moves such as the recent decision by certain European courts about the previous EU decisions on this terrorist cult are unacceptable and unwarranted.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa14">Such behaviour is in contravention of Security Council resolutions on terrorism and will only give rise to an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust in the international fight against terrorism at a time when solidarity among nations to fight that scourge is more imperative than ever. We are of the strong view that there should not be any distinction between the diverse forms of terrorism and terrorist groups. Indeed, terrorism should be fought with no discrimination or exception.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa15">Before concluding, I wish to stress that my delegation rejects the distortions and allegations made against my country by the representative of the Israeli regime in the Council today. No amount of distortion, allegations or smear campaigns will be able to cloud the obvious fact that the Zionist regime continues to display the most single immediate threat to regional and global security through its war crimes and State terrorism against the innocent Palestinians and others in the region.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the  representative of Colombia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Blum</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">Allow me, Sir, to congratulate you on assuming the presidency of the Security Council for the month of December. Croatia's initiative to convene this thematic debate on global security and international terrorism is very timely. It is all the more so at a time when the international community has condemned the recent terrorist attacks in the city of Mumbai, India, which took the lives of hundreds of innocent people and injured hundreds more.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">We reiterate Colombia's condolences to the Government and the people of India and express our solidarity with the victims and their relatives. Having suffered the effects of terrorism, my country well understands the extent of that tragedy.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">The fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, for whatever reasons and committed by whomever, must continue to be one of the priority goals of the international community. Colombia accords the highest priority to efforts aimed at agreeing upon international instruments and mechanisms to fight that scourge. That is why we have supported initiatives at the hemispheric and global levels to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">My country has ratified the relevant agreements on terrorism adopted within the framework of the United Nations. It has also participated in defining mandates and political commitments to prevent and suppress terrorism, agreed upon at summits of the Americas, the Rio Group, the Organization of American States and the United Nations. In that regard, I would like to underline my country's recent ratification of the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">Strengthening cooperation and assistance among States and international organizations is a fundamental aspect in the fight against terrorism. The Government of Colombia believes that this fight demands a cooperative approach through bilateral, regional and subregional instruments that help to address the manifestations of that scourge. The fight against international terrorism can be effective only if all countries are equally committed and progress in implementing their international obligations. We cannot relent in our efforts to eradicate that threat. As long as the security of our citizens and institutions is under siege from that phenomenon, the progress achieved in various areas will be weak and vulnerable.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">In that regard, the need for policies that include comprehensive action against money-laundering and the global drug problem as sources that feed terrorism is increasingly evident. The resolute will of all States to stop providing safe haven to members of terrorist groups and to promote the exchange of intelligence conducive to dismantling the existing networks is also required.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">My delegation considers it appropriate that initiatives aimed at strengthening the capacity of Member States to implement strategies to tackle that problem, particularly through technical assistance mechanisms, are a priority of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. The formation of five groups to deal with cross-sectional assistance in the areas of finance control, arms trafficking, border control, legal issues and other matters provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1624 (2005)</a> is a step in the right direction. So, too, is the Counter-Terrorism Committee's focus on assessing the efficacy of measures adopted by States and on identifying capacities, resources and infrastructure that could be improved.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">Recently, through those mechanisms, my country had the opportunity to offer technical assistance for financial analysis as a tool to address money-laundering. That offer was welcomed and has been channelled, for example, into cooperation with Jamaica, through financing provided by the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism. Also with the Committee's support, Colombia has hosted regional events on such issues as port security management, travel document administration and cybercrime.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">The adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy set a new and decisive milestone, as it provided the international system with a comprehensive perspective in the fight against that scourge. It also allowed a definite course to be marked out to strengthen international cooperation and to tackle the various forms of terrorism and the activities from which it feeds.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">My delegation supports the negotiation and adoption of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism as a complement to the Global Strategy. It is necessary to strengthen efforts to complete the negotiation of that important instrument.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">I would also like to highlight the progress achieved in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a>. That progress should encourage an additional effort by the Security Council and the General Assembly to strengthen coordination and coherence in the criteria, mechanisms and efforts of the Organization in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">At the national level, the defence and democratic security policy, implemented by the Government of Colombia, has achieved results that are widely recognized internationally. Thanks to that policy, my country is now able to better defend the democratic system and the rule of law, guarantee the security and freedom of the people, protect human rights and promote economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa13">Colombia has been carrying out measures and actions against terrorism within the framework of a State policy that engages the different entities and institutions, in accordance with the international agreements to which Colombia is a party. It is clear that the isolated actions of States or international institutions are not enough to address the threat of terrorism. The continued commitment of all States and relevant actors is therefore indispensable, particularly in matters pertaining to crimes closely related to terrorism, such as the global drug problem, money-laundering and the illicit traffic in arms, among other things, which demand a joint, coordinated and sustained effort.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa14">Conscious of that, Colombia wishes to reiterate the need to strengthen cooperation in that area, including at the bilateral, regional and global levels. The responsibility, willing and commitment of all States are essential for the efforts of the international community to be truly effective in that regard.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the  representative of Albania.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Neritani</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Let me join others, Sir, in congratulating you on assuming the current presidency of the Security Council and for organizing this open exchange on very important issues related to global terrorism, international security and strengthening joint international efforts in combating this growing threat. Albania fully aligns itself with the statement made by the representative of France on behalf of the European Union. I would like to add a few comments in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">Terrorism continues to evolve, while effectively and increasingly posing an asymmetrical threat to our common fundamental values. Combined with other serious threats to international peace and security, it continues to demand our proactive capacity for a stronger and more coordinated response. A few days ago, terrorism struck the heart of Mumbai, India. I join other representatives in condemning that cowardly act and extend our full solidarity to the Indian people and Government and the families of all the victims.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">Terrorism is never justifiable on any grounds. It is a global threat that requires a global and comprehensive response. Addressing this evolving threat effectively requires full-spectrum political will and a capacity to implement commitments on the ground. Relevant institutional awareness and policy-level engagements are part of the same equation. The nature of this phenomenon and our common drive towards a shared objective requires participation with and an inclusive policy towards non-governmental organizations and civil society. Our national Government's home-grown strategy, which is characterized by a developed sense of ownership and responsibility, continues to be a key factor in addressing and fulfilling our obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">Albania continues to actively participate in the war against terrorism. In coordination with relevant members of the international community, we are doing our best to strengthen institutional efficiency with an emphasis on creating systems of good governance, an accountable civil society and a competitive economy. These fronts represent challenges that must be faced and require serious engagement in order to obtain tangible, effective results. All actors will have to continue their respective work in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Maintaining a shared level of political will be high on the agenda. Building necessary trust and information-sharing are a few elements of our regional cooperation. In this framework, a holistic approach is necessary and helpful. Terrorism is transnational and demands transnational readiness and response. Building compatible institutional capacities, promptly complying with international obligations, having positive and forward-looking foreign policy objectives and effectively implementing a common constructive and moderating behaviour are key parameters in our regional cooperation, as established by some actors. The western Balkans can offer a more participatory contribution to international peace and security. Tangible progress towards integration into Euro-Atlantic structures can only take place by our joining with and sharing relevant values and principles.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Although regional cooperation is very useful, the United Nations has a unique role to play. The current setting of international treaties gives rise to the duty of joining and implementing them. Albania has ratified most of the United Nations counter-terrorism instruments and protocols and is doing its best to implement them. The United Nations, together with other international institutions and countries, is helping in this regard, for which we are very grateful. We will continue our combined efforts in the future for the benefit of our common objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">The tendency to increase the number of various bodies with the praiseworthy intentions of addressing and tackling this multidimensional scourge has created a situation that may need to be rectified. A culture of cooperation and a rationale applicable towards establishing respective roles of players despite actual and/or potential vested interests can be helpful in generating the potential synergies without duplicating efforts and creating conflicts of interest.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, allow me to reiterate our firm commitment to actively participate in the fight against terrorism. We will continue our efforts and cooperation with the international community in actively and successfully implementing the United Nations Strategy and complying with other resolutions and recommendations of relevant bodies.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Canada.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. McNee</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">Terrorism is a grave threat to international peace and security. We welcome the opportunity to speak today on this important issue and thank the Croatian delegation, and in particular the President of Croatia, for the idea of organizing this debate, which aims at renewing the Council's commitment to fighting terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">At the outset, I would like to express, on behalf of all Canadians, our deepest sympathies and profound condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Canada stands with India and the entire international community in condemning these attacks in the strongest possible terms. We call on all States to assist in bringing those responsible to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">The Mumbai attacks serve as a reminder that terrorism is an evolving and multifaceted global threat -- one which has the potential to affect all Member States. Among those killed in the attacks were nationals of many countries, including Canadians. A terrorist attack on any country is a threat to international peace and stability. The global effects of such attacks underscore the importance of strong international cooperation against terrorism. Multilateral action, in particular through the United Nations, is critical if we are to counter this threat successfully.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">In particular, Canada strongly encourages all United Nations Member States to work towards implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism, including <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1624 (2005)</a>. Canada is in full compliance with these and other terrorism-related Security Council resolutions. Canada also encourages Member States to ratify and implement effectively the relevant international counter-terrorism conventions and protocols, which form the basis for international efforts in this area. We support continued efforts by Member States to work constructively towards the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">Canada also welcomed the 2006 adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. This document and its successful review this year show the ability of Member States to collaborate and achieve consensus on pressing international issues. Following on this agreement, however, Canada strongly urges all Member States to work towards implementation of the Strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">Since 2005, Canada has demonstrated its commitment to a global response to terrorism through its Counter-Terrorism Capacity-Building Assistance Programme. Through this programme, Canada provides $13 million annually to address training, equipment, technical, legal and other security assistance and expertise aspects of the response to terrorist activity, in full compliance with the rule of law, including taking account of human rights.</p>

	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">Canada believes that protection of human rights and respect for the rule of law must be at the centre of both international and national counter-terrorism efforts. Measures against terrorism consistent with international law, in particular international human rights law and refugee and humanitarian law, are critical to the functioning of democratic institutions and the maintenance of peace and security. Strong protections for human rights, including freedom of association and freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, are integral to successfully countering the threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">In conclusion, Canada remains strongly committed to the global fight against terrorism, and encourages the Security Council, as well as other United Nations institutions, to renew its efforts to broaden international consensus on appropriate measures to combat this threat.</p>

	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Morocco.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Loulichki</span> <span class="nation">Morocco</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa01">First of all, on behalf of my delegation, I wish to express to you, Mr. President, our sincere congratulations and our thanks for having taken the initiative to organize this debate on this question, which is so crucial for the international community, namely, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa02">Terrorism is no doubt one of the most serious threats we in the international community currently face given the fact that it attacks not only the foundations of human security but also the principles and values of tolerance, openness and peaceful coexistence and, in the end, our very humanity. The savage attacks that occurred in several places in the city of Mumbai that took the lives of many innocent people have shown that the war on terrorism, despite the exceptional efforts that have been made internationally, is far from being won. Thus, I wish here to renew to the people and the Government of India our most sincere condolences.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa03">The scope and intensity of the terrorist threat that we see in diverse, complex and new ways should prompt us to recognize that the individual actions of States, no matter how much human and material wherewithal are invested, cannot compensate for the impact of a sustained collective and effective commitment with much solidarity aimed at thwarting a real cross-border danger that is likely to emerge in any country and to evolve in any society without distinction as to religion, race, culture, development level or geographical position. In this regard, my delegation, believing that terrorism is the negation of all religious, ethical or human values, expresses its total rejection of any attempt, whatever its source, to associate terrorism with a religion, race, culture or ethnic or racial group.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa04">For Member States, the United Nations represents the legitimate, universal and appropriate framework for forging and strengthening a collective response to terrorism. Member States have benefited from this multilateral framework to develop a legislative framework structuring their common action against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa05">It is in that framework that we should focus our common commitment to finalizing as soon as possible the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism, which would complete the legal arsenal that presently exists. My delegation continues to attach great importance to concluding the comprehensive convention and remains ready to contribute to ongoing consultations to overcome the obstacles that are preventing its successful conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa06">These efforts should be based on the positive climate and constructive spirit that we recently saw in the review meeting of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy held in September. It is now up to Member States to develop the Strategy individually and collectively and to strive for its effective and comprehensive implementation at the national, regional and international levels. Morocco emphasizes the need for close, concerted and coordinated international cooperation to combat terrorism that brings together political commitment, legal frameworks and operational action.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa07">The Kingdom of Morocco has suffered from this scourge and once again reiterates its full and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We expressed this position the very day when, in 1979, the initiative was taken to inscribe the issue of counter-terrorism on the agenda of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa08">Morocco unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations because it is one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and threatens the most fundamental human rights -- the right to life.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa09">My country shares the concerns of the international community regarding terrorism and has acted for many years now in the framework of international efforts to fight this scourge. For example, we have adopted an integrated legal arsenal in keeping with the requirements of the rule of law and in harmony with international commitments assumed by Morocco.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa10">My country is determined to build its national capacities in a preventative sense, strengthened by the mobilization of all components of its population and by their support for the counter-terrorism efforts undertaken by the Government authorities. That said -- and we cannot say it enough -- national efforts, no matter how strenuous, are insufficient unless accompanied by proactive and effective regional and international cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa11">In this context, my country will spare no effort to contribute to all initiatives in support of collective actions in this area. In that respect, by way of illustration, the Fifth Conference of Justice Ministers of Francophone African countries was held in Rabat from 12 to 16 May 2008 to ratify and implement universal instruments against terrorism, with the effective assistance of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa12">In this same spirit of mobilizing against all forms of terrorism, in 2006 my country held the inaugural meeting of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. In October 2008, we also hosted the second anniversary of the launching of the Initiative, which now has 75 member States.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa13">In conclusion, my country reiterates its absolute and total condemnation of all forms of terrorism and its commitment to participating in implementing global, concerted action to strengthen international cooperation in this area. The counter-terrorism efforts of the international community cannot be fully realized unless they operate in a global and multidimensional framework that attacks the underlying causes of terrorism through the resolution of regional and international conflicts, the strengthening of our commitment against underdevelopment, and the promotion of values of dialogue among cultures, religions and civilizations. Thus, only an approach combining the security and causal dimensions of this phenomenon will overcome this scourge.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Malaysia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zainuddin</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">My delegation wishes to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate of the Security Council on the threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. I believe that this debate provides an excellent opportunity for Member States to revitalize their solidarity and contribute ideas to strengthen the leading role of the United Nations in conducting global anti-terrorism efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">Let me take this opportunity to affirm our solidarity with the Government of India and to convey our heartfelt condolences to the families of victims of the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai and our deepest sympathies to those injured and affected in any way by the carnage that resulted from those cowardly acts.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">We reiterate our categorical condemnation of those terrorist acts and all other acts of terrorism, irrespective of its motivation and objectives, in all its forms and manifestations, including State terrorism. The terrorist attack in Mumbai clearly demonstrates again how terrorism directly threatens regional peace and international security.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">International terrorism by its very nature is borderless. Terrorist groups, in fact, make use of advances in technology, transportation and globalization to exploit the weak links in transborder situations to plan, raise funds and eventually mount their asymmetric attacks, more frequently now on civilian targets. Therefore, we cannot overemphasize the need for the international community to intensify cooperation and for the United Nations to provide a stronger leading role to narrow down and eventually obliterate the space for these terrorist activities.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">In this regard, my delegation is encouraged by the improvements in the work methods under the United Nations counter-terrorism regimes, especially those of the subsidiary bodies established pursuant to Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a>. We welcome the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1822(2008).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1822 (2008)</a> and the short-term goal of the 1267 Committee to make the Consolidated List a living document while, at the same time, responding to calls by the general membership for the listing and de-listing process to guarantee more stringent criteria for due process, including the human rights of terrorist suspects.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">My delegation also welcomes the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee in completing the Preliminary Implementation Assessment of all Member States, while avoiding putting too much of a reporting burden on the Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">Nevertheless, the subsidiary bodies of the Security Council for counter-terrorism need to rigorously evaluate their effectiveness and to constantly improve ways to facilitate the effective implementation of resolutions. We should avoid a situation in which Member States are turned off by the requirements of the subsidiary bodies or, much worse, in which the subsidiary bodies work on their own, in a total disconnect from the general membership of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa08">We continue to be confronted almost daily by news of some form of terrorist acts involving greater numbers of civilian casualties. My delegation regrets that the international community is still struggling to adopt a universally accepted definition of terrorism when there is agreement that we cannot accept or tolerate these terrorist acts. To use the analogy of the six blind men and the elephant, while we address the same enemy, we fail to agree on how to define it. We feel that this is important because without this definition, we are unable to address this scourge comprehensively. As a result of our inability to agree in this regard, international counter-terrorism cooperation is compromised by narrow national perceptions and conflicting political expediencies. Agreement on a universal definition should help to create full solidarity behind comprehensive international action against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa09">My delegation also wishes to re-emphasize its strong conviction that all the best efforts and resources expended to wage war on terrorism would be futile if the environment that breeds terrorism is left unchecked. As a country that has gone through this experience, particularly during the communist insurgency, Malaysia remains convinced that the best way to fight terrorism is to address its root causes. No prison or detention camp would be big enough if terrorist recruitment continues to thrive in environments of utter despair and indignity in situations of colonization, foreign occupation, the wrongful seizure of land and destruction of homes, illegal settlement, ethnic cleansing, abject poverty or lack of hope for protection and redress.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa10">In the same vein, attributing terrorism to a particular religion or nationality is a misguided effort, as no religion propagates terrorism and no nationality is predisposed to it. My delegation calls on the international community to reject any attempt to link Islam and Muslims to terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa11">Mr. President, we welcome the identification of a new direction, as reflected in your concept paper for this debate (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-738.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/738</a>), to the effect that religions are victims of terrorism and socio-economic handicaps are indeed a factor favouring the spread of terrorism. We definitely have a new challenge confronting us: to mend the atmosphere of mistrust, serious infringement of human rights and civilizational and cultural division caused by terrorism and counter-terrorism actions. Furthermore, the United Nations should definitely take a firm lead in future counter-terrorism efforts both within the Security Council and within the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa12">In conclusion, my delegation wishes to reaffirm Malaysia's commitment to lending its fullest cooperation to all States and the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. Malaysia believes that terrorism can be eliminated only through full cooperation and solidarity among all members of the international community in a comprehensive counter-terrorism effort.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Escalona Ojeda</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the current month. I welcome the fact that the Council has considered it important to convene a debate on so essential a topic as that before us today: threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. Undoubtedly, that is an issue that can be analysed from various perspectives and in various ways. However, if there is one thing on which all peoples and nearly all Governments throughout the world have agreed, it is that without justice there can be no peace, and without peace there can be no international security.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">When the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela revised its constitution in 1999, we set out in its preamble the overall guidelines for our legal and political conduct in the international arena. They promote peaceful cooperation among nations and encourage and strengthen Latin American integration in accordance with the principle of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples, the universal and indivisible guarantee of human rights, the democratization of international society, nuclear disarmament, ecological balance and environmental resources as the common and inalienable heritage of humankind.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">Those guidelines have guided the course of our nation over the past nine years, during which we have been subjected to various kinds of international threats. These have included organizing internal conspiracies in order to overthrow the Government and weakening democracy by spreading violence and attempting to promote chaos in order to destabilize our society so that we will be declared an unviable State, a failed State, with all the consequences that that could have for our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our very existence as a nation.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">In that context, a serious terrorist act was committed in Venezuela. It involved the assassination of Prosecutor Danilo Anderson, who was investigating the very people who had been involved in the coup d'état against President Hugo Chávez Frías. As a result, President Chávez Frías has denounced in various international forums those Governments that claim they defend peace and fight terrorism, while they attack other States and promote terrorism against them.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">The terrible and deplorable events of 11 September 2001 aroused global indignation, and Venezuela clearly condemned them. However, they gave rise to a policy that has various aspects. First, it changed the fight against terrorism into an excuse to attack and invade other countries. Secondly, it led to the systematic use of terror and human rights violations as a way to punish others for reasons linked to racial, cultural and religious discrimination, which has affected Muslim citizens in particular, as if it were a clash of civilizations, which cannot be true. What we are seeing in today's world is, on the contrary, a meeting among various cultures and a profound and promising process of racial mixing. Despite the fact that such a positive process is under way, what has been imposed is ethnic cleansing, giving rise to conflicts that loom over the global political arena and pose a serious threat to peace.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">In the name of the supposed defence of national and international security, constitutional rights are being de-legitimized and violated, and legal statutes and norms of international coexistence are being flouted. Countries are being invaded, which has killed tens of thousands, including women, the elderly, children and entire villages. The cultural, economic and ecological heritage and physical infrastructures are being destroyed in a mad spree that surpasses any other atrocity in history.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">We cannot fight terrorism -- which Venezuela has always condemned -- through State terrorism, whose deadly aggression is masked with the description "collateral damage", when what is involved is families who have been bombed when they were walking on a beach, having parties or simply staying peacefully at home. We must denounce and condemn those atrocities and demand that the aggressors be stopped.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">We repudiate the recent attacks in Mumbai. We express our solidarity with the people and the Government of India and hope that the ongoing investigations will lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">We condemn impunity. That is why we wish to recall that, here in the United States, the dangerous terrorist Luis Posada Carriles -- who is responsible for cruel acts, including blowing up a Cuban aircraft -- is at liberty and protected by the authorities. Impunity is a lack of justice and is just as deadly as terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa10">Today, we are experiencing different kinds of threats to peace. One of them could be the terrible global inequality, in which 5 per cent of the world's population consumes 25 per cent of all world's energy resources and the rich, who constitute 16 per cent of the population -- basically, the United States, Europe and Japan -- consume 80 per cent of the world's goods.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa11">Moreover, we should warn that the present international financial system has shown that it generates serious disturbances of the peace, since its actions have increased unemployment, poverty and injustice. That generates violence of all sorts and creates a threat of chaos and terror, because without justice there can be no peace.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa12">Another aspect that is a serious threat to peace has to do with environmental issues. The planet is being killed through pollution, the destruction of biological diversity, global warming and the ruin of seas, rivers and other sources of water, all of which constitutes a severe threat to mankind and the loss of the planet's productivity. That intensifies hunger, above all in women and children, which is a real act of terror.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa13">We can in no way believe that it is necessary for a human being to die in order to achieve peace. We believe in consensual agreements that are reached in a peaceful, fair and equitable manner. We think it is possible to settle disputes and conflicts via dialogue and negotiations, with respect for international law and for especially human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa14">We once again call for disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation as a condition for the security of all nations. So too we recognize the right of all countries to carry out whatever research they deem necessary for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa15">The practice of terror has no justification and States have the obligation to put an end to torture, detentions without trial, special military tribunals, clandestine prisons, kidnappings and other affronts to human dignity.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haroon</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">Today the United Nations has gathered to debate threats to international peace and security. It is fitting that the President of Croatia, His Excellency Mr. Stjepan Mesi, is presiding over this discussion. Croatia has suffered enormous trauma and has been devastated by the threats to its peace and security. I express my felicitations to His Excellency for not only presiding over this debate, but for also giving us, in his first address, the benefit of his experience in this matter.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa02">Today, as we discuss this important issue, we are troubled by two very tragic events that resulted in the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians in Mumbai, India, and a few days later in Peshawar, Pakistan. These horrific devastations were thousands of miles apart, yet they have a discernible imprint of common purpose. They remind us of the common threat posed by terrorism and of our common birth and destiny.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa03">I condemn these incidents and condole with all concerned. The President of Pakistan asked me to convey to the Council the pain in India as he perceives it:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg031-bk01-pa04">"We can identify with India's pain. I am especially sympathetic. I feel this pain every time I look into the eyes of my children."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa05">Today, in the New York Times, the President of Pakistan has stated to the world his intent that Pakistan is committed to the pursuit, arrest, trial and punishment of anyone involved in those heinous attacks. Pakistan will take action against non-State actors found within our territory, treating them as criminals, terrorists and murderers. Not only are the terrorists not linked to the Government of Pakistan in any way, we too are their targets and we too continue to be their victims. The President then goes on to say very empathetically, "But we caution against hasty judgments and inflammatory statements".</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa06">The words of the President have today been converted from commitment to action. The New York Times has carried an article describing "Pakistan raids militants linked to Mumbai attacks", in which I specifically quote the Army Information Department of Pakistan as saying, "We have started intelligence-led operations against banned militant outfits and organizations today". That is a very important statement, as it shows that all arms of the Pakistani Government are moving in coordination and cohesion towards punishment of those who seek, in any way, to destroy the peace of our neighbours and of our own country.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa07">So Pakistan has cast the proverbial first stone. I was a little surprised by the strong denouncement by my friends in India at the Security Council today, but then I view it under the domestic political considerations of the moment. But I do ask, is it warranted? Is there anything that we are not willing to do with you, within reason? The President of Pakistan clearly stated to India and the world that "the best response to the Mumbai carnage is to coordinate to counteracting the scourge of terrorism". I think this is a very important offer. The world must act to strengthen Pakistan's economy and democracy, help us build civil society and provide us with the law enforcement and counter-terrorism capacities that will enable us to fight the terrorist activity effectively. He further goes on to say that India and Pakistan and the rest of the world must work together to track down the terrorists who caused mayhem in Mumbai, attacked New York, London, Madrid and also destroyed the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad in September.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa08">We did not wish to raise any issues, but by jumping to conclusions, I would request that my friends in India recall that when the Friendship Samjhauta Express -- I do not want to raise this, but I am just giving this as an example -- was burned down, with Muslim passengers killed on their way to Pakistan, fingers were pointed hastily at Pakistan. Later it was proved that an Indian Army colonel was involved.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa09">Similarly -- not a point I would have raised today, but under the circumstances -- with regard to Kashmir, Pakistan, despite its domestic situation, is exercising restraint in international forums, and that is how we would have liked to have seen the aftermath of the Mumbai incident as well. We are all aware that the Kashmir situation is the root cause of all the problems between India and Pakistan. Would it not be a good time to do away with the root cause by pledging to resolve it, not just with words but with deeds and actions, as we have done today in Pakistan, and get that problem away from us all?</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa10">How should we proceed? I would say, let us recommend to each other to stop all negative campaigns against each other, that India must help resolve even the religious aspect. Some of those here may not be aware that in the Northwestern frontier province, where that matter has taken root in a very deep way, there is a very strong quarter of society led entirely by the mullahs. These mullahs owe their obeisance to the mullahs in Deoband, India. I do not say this as a criticism or to point fingers -- I have a very good suggestion.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa11">What I would like to say is that if senior clerics from Deoband, who wield great influence in the North-West Frontier territories of Pakistan and in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, would come to Pakistan, get together and, in their tremendous knowledge of religion, offer a fatwa in Pakistan against the suicide bombings and the killing of Muslims that are happening in Pakistan and even in India, I think it would have a very important effect in the North-West Frontier province. In fact, the most powerful politician from that province happens to be Maulana Fazul-ur-Rehman, who also owes his obeisance to Deoband.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa12">So we can help each other, we can be with each other, and we can use each other's facilities -- the last idea being perhaps the most important, and which has not yet even been considered.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa13">I would also like to give the Council a few glimpses of measures being undertaken today in Pakistan.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa14">First, the Government of Pakistan has already initiated investigations on its own pertaining to the allegations of the involvement of persons and entities in the Mumbai attacks.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa15">Secondly, after the designation by the Indian Government of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, the Government, upon receiving this instruction, shall proscribed the Jamaat-ud-Dawa and take other consequential actions, as required, including the freezing of assets. A plan is being prepared to ensure effective Government supervision, as required by this body and others of the various welfare organizations. An intelligence-led operation, strongly supported by law enforcement agencies, is already under way to arrest the individuals alleged to be involved in the Mumbai attacks. No training camps for Lashkar-e-Tayyiba or any entity of this nature shall be allowed on the territory of Pakistan.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa16">The aforementioned measures, which are in process, constitute further proof of Pakistan's determination to take action and not to allow its territory to be used for terrorism. The Pakistan Government's ability and capacity to take strong measures requires the understanding and full support of its friends, the United Nations and its Security Council. In addition to our proposal of a joint commission and investigations, we have now proposed that India receive the highest possible level delegation from Pakistan to sort out these affairs and ensure that matters are further improved in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa17">But now let me come to the real focus of this debate. I feel that our object is to improve and strengthen international cooperation and coordination in the fight against terrorism. In the broader fight against terrorism, the pre-eminence of operational measures can never be challenged. However, to ensure the total defeat of terrorists, we need to formulate comprehensive strategies.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa18">We believe that a simplistic approach to resolving intricate problems will create more problems. The first and foremost need of the time is that we promote international harmony, in which this Council can play an exceedingly important role. We must reject efforts aimed at creating new divisions, clashes and schisms. The human thirst for justice, however misperceived it may be, can be better quenched through political means than through force.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa19">We must therefore promote political solutions to long-standing unresolved conflicts; here I would cite the situations in Kashmir and Palestine. Though these conflicts are unique in nature, they present similar challenges and opportunities. We should be encouraged by the dividends of the political solution of the Northern Ireland issue achieved through the Good Friday Agreement and follow in the same direction.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa20">I would like to underscore the need to strengthen democracies and to create an all-inclusive environment of support to fight the menace of terrorism. It helps to isolate those who promote their cause through force instead of debate and dialogue. It promotes the sense of social participation and mainstreams the fringe elements. The sinister terrorist masterminds take pains to identify and sabotage nascent friendships. If we succumb to their designs and actions, they repeat their actions. If you get closer after the destructive actions, they are discouraged. So the need is to get closer. A consistent pattern of response based on divisions will not only expose our weaknesses, but encourage the evil. We need to stand united in the hour of crisis, taking that stance as an important element of our counter-terrorism strategy, to further cement the relationships aimed at fighting this menace.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa21">For the long-term resolution of international terrorism and security issues, we need to look into all root causes of international terrorism and security-related matters. These issues have been covered in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly. We need to implement the Strategy in a balanced and comprehensive way.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa22">Last but not least, we have to sincerely and effectively address the capacity-building needs of the partner countries. A partnership in which we are reluctant to share critical equipment and technologies will lack trust and amount to disarming those fighting against terrorists. This could not only result in undesired casualties, but would also prolong the war.</p>

	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council this month. I would also like to commend you for holding this important meeting. It takes place following the terrorist incidents in Mumbai, India, which resulted in the death and injury of many innocent civilians. My country was one of the first to condemn those attacks through the President of the Republic, Bashar Al-Assad, who also expressed his condolences on behalf the Syrian people to the fraternal people and Government of India.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa02">The representative of Israel has once again used the venue of the Security Council to falsify facts about the terrorist acts that have been organized and carried out by her State for decades now. The representative of Israel thought that, through attacks against my country, she could distract attention from the problems of violence and terrorism in our region.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa03">The essential fact here is that Israel is occupying Arab territories and committing crimes against humanity. These acts have been carried out by successive Israeli Governments against the defenceless Palestinian people. Everyone knows that Israel is imposing an unfair embargo against Gaza and has adopted a slow-kill policy against more than 1.5 million Palestinians there. Israel has folded its arms when confronted with the terrorist acts of Israeli settlers committed against Palestinians in Hebron. The intervention by the representative of Israel cannot change the terrible past of terrorism -- the archives, encyclopaedias and museums are filled with facts about ethnic cleansing, war crimes and genocide committed by Israel in the course of its bloody history against Palestinians, Syrians, Lebanese, Egyptians, Jordanians and nationals of other countries.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa04">Israel introduced State terrorism in the region. The terrorist gangs are well known to everyone. They include Shtren, Irgun, Stern Gang, Haganah and Balmakh, which have killed thousands of Palestinians and evicted millions of them from their land. Israel assassinated United Nations special envoy Count Bernadotte. By hijacking a Syrian civilian aircraft in 1954, Israel committed the first act of air piracy in history. Israel carried out political assassinations in Beirut in 1968, killing unarmed civilian intellectuals. In the 1980s, it carried out attacks against heads of Palestinian municipalities, using booby-trapped cars. Israel bombed the American intelligence vessel, <i>USS Liberty</i>, during the 1967 war, after it had intercepted orders for the mass execution of Egyptian prisoners in the Sinai. In 1971, Israel shot down a Libyan civilian plane.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa05">Israel attacked the headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in southern Lebanon, killing 106 civilians who had taken refuge in the United Nations building. In 2006, Israel attacked observer positions in the areas of Maroun Al-Ras and Al-Khiam. Let us not forget the report issued by the Canadian Army, which investigated a terrorist crime that had led to the deaths of a Canadian commander and three Austrian, Chinese and Finnish observers. That report revealed that Israel had deliberately attacked their position. There were also other suspicious operations against peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa06">A Belgian commander, killed on 5 September 2008, was the most recent victim of Israeli attacks in our region. He was killed during a demining operation to remove mines planted by Israel in southern Lebanon. Israel continues to refuse to provide maps of where it has planted mines and cluster bombs in Lebanon, which have caused the deaths of hundreds of Lebanese, including dozens of women and children, despite repeated calls by the Security Council and the United Nations to provide such maps.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa07">That is the reality of the terrorist State of Israel, whose representative has unsuccessfully attempted to detract attention from its terrorist nature. The representative of Israel has also labelled Palestinian refugee organizations as terrorist groups -- refugees whom the State of Israel has forced into exile from their lands and homes for decades. Those refugees are attempting to regain their rights and to have recourse to international legality through international resolutions. Arab States, including Syria, have hosted those brotherly refugees, providing them with the support they need while they wait to return to their country, Palestine. They have done so in line with resolutions of international legality, especially General Assembly resolution 194 (III), on the Palestinians' right of return.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa08">Like the majority of States, Syria has supported the right of peoples to freedom and self-determination. For many years, Syria condemned the odious apartheid regime in South Africa, whose main partner was Israel.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa09">Let us not forget Israel's terrorism against the rights of the Syrian people in the occupied Syrian Golan. That State terrorism has been condemned annually by the United Nations in most of its Main Committees, as well as by the yearly vote on and adoption of resolutions condemning Israel's occupation of the Golan and its annexation of it in 1981. The United Nations has likewise condemned the repression of Syrian citizens by Israeli occupying authorities. Israel's practices are tantamount to collective punishment and war crimes, and run counter to international law.</p>
	<p id="pg033-bk02-pa10">Had Israel not pursued its occupation in the Palestinian, Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories for many decades, we would not be witnessing the legitimate acts of resistance that Israel and those who protect it deem to be terrorism. Had influential countries in the United Nations not continued to support Israel's crimes in our region, international cooperation and efforts to combat terrorism would have been more effective, useful and productive.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Willson</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg034-bk01-pa01">The allegations that we have heard this afternoon concerning the case of Luis Posada Carriles and the five Cubans convicted of spying in the United States are not new. In almost every recent Security Council debate on counter-terrorism, those cases have been raised. They were raised today and they were raised less than a month ago, during the Council's debate on 12 November on the work of its counter-terrorism committees. At that time, the United States gave a detailed description of the background and legal steps that had been taken by the Government of the United States with regard to those cases. Rather than repeat that discussion, I refer interested delegations to the verbatim record of the 12 November response, which is available in document <a href="../html/S-PV-6015.html">S/PV.6015</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg034-bk02-pa01">The representative of Cuba has asked for the floor to make a further statement. I now give him the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg035-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Benitez Versón</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa01">I have asked for the floor to respond to the statement that has just been made by the representative of the United States. Given that the Council's debate today has been lengthy and at times intense, I shall be brief.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa02">We understand that it is not pleasant for the delegation of the United States for uncomfortable truths about the behaviour of its Government to be introduced in the Security Council. However, that cannot prevent those truths from being stated and repeated. It is to no avail for them to attempt repeatedly to cover up the obvious. The reality evident to everyone is that the Government of the United States has gone to truly shameful extremes to protect the most famous terrorist in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa03">The decision to allow Posada Carriles to go free, who continues to maintain contacts in Miami with terrorist elements and the extreme right, is the clearest illustration of the duplistic morality of the current Government of the United States. It is also a complete refutation of its supposed fight against terrorism. The Government of the United States expects us passively to accept its hypocritical call to do as it says and not as it does.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa04">The case of Luis Posada Carriles is undoubtedly the best known example, but of course it is hardly the only one. In Miami and other cities of the United States, funds are provided and used to finance terrorist activities with complete impunity. Bank accounts are openly and regularly used to finance terrorism. Terrorists are recruited, while weapons are purchased and territory is provided to those who finance, plan and commit terrorist acts against Cuba.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk01-pa05">Cuba once again asks the Security Council to assess the ample and detailed information provided by our country and to take appropriate action. That would contribute to the efforts to end the impunity enjoyed by those who plan and commit terrorist activities against Cuba from the territory of the United States. Cuba hopes that justice will be done sooner rather than later.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Doraiswami</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk03-pa01">We listened carefully to the statement made by the Ambassador of Pakistan. The certain truth is that this is terrorism and that territory controlled by Pakistan is used by terrorist groups based in Pakistan to perpetrate acts of terror in India. Pakistan should focus its attention on taking action against the criminals who perpetrate, aid, abet, finance or otherwise support terrorism, rather than bring before the Council extraneous issues relating to the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

	<p id="pg035-bk04-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, who has asked to make a further statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg035-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Escalona Ojeda</span> <span class="nation">Venezuela</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk05-pa01">We listened to the statement of the representative of the United States concerning the case of Luis Posada Carriles. It is a very simple case. Mr. Posada Carriles has declared his responsibility for terrorist acts, as reflected even in the United States press. Furthermore, Mr. Posada Carriles is a fugitive from Venezuelan justice and Venezuela has requested the United States to extradite him. Those requests should be heard.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk05-pa02">The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has also announced its readiness to enter into dialogue with the Government of the United States at the very highest level in order to normalize our relations. That is necessary immediately if we are to find a way to solve all these issues through dialogue and direct discussions. There is only one condition to that end: respect for the sovereignty of the Government and people of Venezuela. With that single condition satisfied, along with respect for the sovereignty of all peoples, I am convinced that we will find a path to peace, dialogue and understanding.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa01">There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa02">I take this opportunity to thank all members of the Council for their cooperation in drafting the text of the presidential statement that I shall shortly read out. I also thank all those who participated in the debate for their constructive contributions. I believe I am correct in saying that this meeting has brought us closer to the consensus that is so necessary in the global struggle against terrorism, which poses a threat to everyone, everywhere and at all times.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa03">Following consultations among Council members, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa04">"The Security Council, underlining that peace and security in the world are indivisible and taking into account the interconnection and interdependence of the world, reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by whomsoever committed. It further reaffirms its determination to combat threats to international peace and security caused by acts of terrorism by all possible means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes recent statements by intergovernmental organizations condemning all forms of terrorism, including suicide bombing and hostage-taking, which build upon the universal condemnation by the international community of unlawful acts of terrorism, including against civilians, that cannot be justified or excused under any circumstances or pursuant to any political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other consideration, and reaffirms the need for Member States to work together urgently to prevent and suppress such acts.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa06">"The Security Council emphasizes the central role of the United Nations in the global struggle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of all its resolutions and statements on terrorism, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1624(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1624 (2005)</a>, and stresses the need for their full implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa08">"The Security Council renews its call on States to become parties as soon as possible to all relevant international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism and to implement those they are party to.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa09">"The Security Council believes that terrorist safe havens continue to be a significant concern and reaffirms the need for States to strengthen cooperation in order to find, deny safe haven and bring to justice, on the basis of the principle of extradite or prosecute, any person who supports, facilitates, participates or attempts to participate in the financing, planning, preparation or commission of terrorist acts or provides safe havens.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa10">"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of the work of the committees established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1267 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1540 (2004)</a> and continues its support and guidance to the committees.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg035-bk06-pa11">"The Security Council particularly expresses its support for and commitment to contributing to the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (<a href="../pdf/A-60-288.pdf" class="pdf">A/60/288</a>) of 8 September 2006 and welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-272.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 62/272</a>, which reaffirmed this Strategy and its four pillars and called for its implementation in an integrated manner and in all its aspects.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa12">"The Security Council emphasizes that enhancing dialogue and broadening the understanding among civilizations, in an effort to prevent the indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures, and addressing unresolved regional conflicts and the full range of global issues, including development issues, will contribute to international cooperation, which by itself is necessary to sustain the broadest possible fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa13">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the incitement of terrorist acts and repudiates attempts at the justification or glorification of terrorist acts that may incite further terrorist acts. It reaffirms the importance of countering radicalization and extremism that may lead to terrorism and preventing exploitation of young people by violent extremists.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa14">"The Security Council, reaffirming that the promotion and protection of human rights for all and the rule of law are essential to an effective counter-terrorism strategy and that effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are complementary and mutually reinforcing, reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa15">"The Security Council emphasizes the importance of technical assistance aimed at increasing the capabilities of Member States in the fight against terrorism by addressing their counter-terrorism needs.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa16">"The Security Council believes that the strengthening of mutual trust among Member States of the United Nations will facilitate the creation of conditions for a successful fight against terrorism, and that success in that fight will positively reinforce peace and security in the world.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa17">"The Security Council, deeply concerned with the continuous terrorist attacks around the world, calls on all Member States of the United Nations to renew the degree of solidarity manifested immediately after the tragic event of 11 September 2001, and to redouble efforts to tackle global terrorism, dedicating significant attention to bringing to justice the perpetrators, facilitators and masterminds of terrorist acts while expressing deep compassion with all victims of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa18">"The Security Council will continue to follow developments in order to organize as efficiently as possible its efforts in combating terrorism."</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa19">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-45.pdf" class="nolink">S/PRST/2008/45</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg035-bk06-pa20">The Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
