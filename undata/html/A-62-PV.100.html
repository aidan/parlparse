	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">In accordance with rule 30 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, we shall now proceed to the election of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly for its sixty-third session.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">All members of the General Assembly are eligible in this election except those already represented in the General Committee, namely, those countries whose representatives have been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly or to the chairmanships of the Main Committees for the sixty-third session.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-33-138.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 33/138</a>, of 19 December 1978, the 21 Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly for the sixty-third session shall be elected according to the following pattern: six representatives from African States, five representatives from Asian States, one representative from Eastern European States, two representatives from Latin American and Caribbean States, two representatives from Western European and other States, and representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">In accordance with paragraph 16 of annex V to the rules of procedure, the election of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly by secret ballot will be dispensed with when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">We shall proceed accordingly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">I shall now read out the names of the endorsed candidates.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg001-bk05-pa07">African States: Cameroon, Egypt, Namibia, the Niger, Rwanda and Togo.</blockquote>

	<blockquote id="pg001-bk05-pa10">Western European and other States: Portugal and Spain.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">Since the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled in each region, I declare those candidates elected, in addition to the representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa12">The following States have therefore been elected to vice-presidencies of the General Assembly for its sixty-third session: Afghanistan, Bolivia, Cameroon, China, Egypt, France, Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, the Niger, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, Solomon Islands, Spain, Togo, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.</p>
