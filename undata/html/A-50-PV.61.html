	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa01">The world has witnessed the rapid expansion of representative democracy all over the world in the past few years. While this world-wide surge for democracy is a welcome development for parliamentarians like us, the greatest challenge facing us today is how to sustain this democratic process. The arrival of democracy has been accompanied by the soaring expectations of the people, who are the underpinnings of a democratic society. But the necessary institutions, mechanisms, resources and capabilities at the disposal of many States are awfully inadequate to meet the emerging aspirations of their peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">As direct representatives of the people, it is the role of parliamentarians not only to articulate and interpret these aspirations and formulate policies in the shape of laws keeping in view these practical difficulties, but also to goad governments to implement them. In other words, their role is both to uphold the ideals that nurture and sustain democracy and to act as a link between the State and the people. This is indeed a daunting task. Continued contacts with fellow parliamentarians and with organizations such as the United Nations help to deepen their commitment to democratic ideals and their understanding of the problems involved worldwide.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is an international organization of national parliaments. It offers a venue for the parliamentarians of 135 countries, including my own, to get together and exchange information as well as share experiences with one another. IPU has remained dedicated all these years to democratization and to the promotion and establishment of democratic institutions in countries where representative democracies are in their infancy. Its contribution to disseminating information about the importance of free and fair elections, the participation of women and men as equal partners in social, economic and political life, and the protection and promotion of human rights and individual freedom has undoubtedly been singular. Since both IPU and the United Nations stand to serve ideals which are very similar in character and purpose, and since their activities are mutually reinforcing, it is important that cooperation between these two organizations be institutionalized and strengthened.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Nepal appreciates the efforts undertaken so far by these two organizations to foster closer links with a view to further enhancing the process of the consolidation of nascent democracies in many countries of the world. Nepal, therefore, welcomes and supports the draft resolution contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.20.pdf">A/50/L.20</a>, which requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps to conclude an agreement on cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU containing provisions for regular consultation and cooperation. Such cooperation, in our view, will pave the way for launching, <i>inter alia</i>, joint programmes and the exchange of information and documentation. It will also facilitate the IPU's participation in other organs of the United Nations, its programmes, funds and specialized agencies and even United Nations-sponsored international conferences.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa05">In my own country, Nepal, where the restoration of democracy was made possible by the sacrifices of the people, we have been busy strengthening the democratization process through two general elections in the course of the last five years. We have initiated numerous plans and programmes with the express intention of consolidating democracy in the country. We are convinced that a strong institutional framework that addresses the issues of development is indispensable for democracy, as we have seen that weak economies only manage to sustain democracy at a very high cost. As a land-locked least developed country, we have faced scores of challenges in our efforts to consolidate democracy. Without democracy, peace and development are not possible, and without development, peace and democracy cannot be enduring. Our first and foremost preoccupation, therefore, has been to strive for the promotion of socio-economic development within a human rights-oriented democratic framework. In our view, democratic ideals cannot be truly sustained where millions of people continue to live in conditions of absolute poverty and hunger and where easy access to food, health care, education, shelter and a clean environment is still a distant dream.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa06">Nepal believes that the task of upholding democracy also requires the consolidation of democratic institutions and the promotion of democratic cultures. Free and fair periodic elections, an independent judiciary, respect for human rights and freedom of the press are, among others, the vital ingredients that constitute democracy. The United Nations and its specialized agencies have, all along, played catalytic roles in the development and growth of democratic institutions. Enhanced cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union is, therefore, crucial in helping national parliaments and parliamentarians deploy their efforts to address the problems of socio-economic development and democratic institution-building effectively. We also recognize that national Parliaments and national Governments themselves have to play primary roles in these areas. However, the task of meeting the challenges of democratization will be easier if their efforts towards social and economic development and poverty eradication are backed by the cooperation of the international community and the United Nations.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">As I take the floor on agenda item 150 of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, entitled Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union', I should like to say that it is no mere chance that the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a youthful institution that goes back 106 years, has come forward to meet the United Nations as it celebrates its fiftieth anniversary.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">Created in 1889, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, in the phrase of our Secretary-General, was a "pioneer and a precursor". It was the first permanent forum for dialogue between representatives of democratic States and, in a sense, it is no doubt the first institution to have envisaged the democratic imperative as part of the international legal order.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">Why, then, is this meeting only now taking place? In fact, over the years, parliamentarians have engaged in many activities within the United Nations, but outside the meetings of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">However, the relevance of this initiative lies in its newness and its content. Having dealt with the first point, I should like to turn to the other.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">Burkina Faso, along with 134 other countries, is a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. At the Union's last meeting the President of Burkina Faso's People's Assembly of Deputies was elected to a vice-presidency, along with representatives of Tunisia, Zambia, the Republic of Korea, India, Argentina, Venezuela, Hungary, Slovenia, Iceland, Italy and Sweden, with Egypt occupying the presidency.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa06">The United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union share principles and objectives and, therefore, areas of interest and activity. In this respect, the promotion of peace and international cooperation might require more frequent consultations between the two organizations, leading to the joint coordination of certain activities and mutual assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa07">The special nature of the Inter-Parliamentary Union should make possible a special relationship with the United Nations: the two bodies could, at the international level, constitute a link between Governments and Parliaments. If there is to be a fruitful relationship, we should envisage a proper framework for strengthening and maximizing cooperation through participation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa08">In conclusion, I should like to say that I have no doubt that in this endeavour the United Nations will do what is necessary.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Parliaments are fundamental institutions in the political life of States. They channel the participation of the people into the Governments of nations. Beyond the strictly national framework, Parliaments also take an interest in international affairs and participate in them in a variety of ways, one of which -- a particularly important one -- is involvement in the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The Inter-Parliamentary Union is a singular institution in international life, being the world organization in which, for more than a century, national Parliaments have come together to engage in dialogue. We cannot ignore its existence and ever more intensive and varied activities at the present stage of the renewal of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Multilateral diplomacy, which has also been called parliamentary diplomacy, borrows from the parliamentary tradition procedures, rules, terminology and ways of thinking and acting that show democracy in operation. Disagreement, in the framework of the principles of freedom of opinion and expression and respect for the ideas and viewpoints of others, has endowed international relations with a democratic component <i>par excellence</i>. It is in that context that the United Nations was created, and has developed, as a forum for dialogue and a centre for world-wide cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Multilateral diplomacy -- an instrument of international relations in a world society that we hope will become ever more open, egalitarian and democratic -- should also take very much into account the voice of the Parliaments of States, which are the embodiment of popular representation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa05">In the light of this parallelism between parliamentary life at the national level and the discussion of matters of global interest in the forum of the United Nations, it must be clear that there is already contact and cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa06">The importance of cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union was recently highlighted in the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-332.pdf">A/50/332</a>) entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies" which says:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa07">"IPU is a particularly relevant partner of the United Nations in this regard. Since its inception, in 1889, IPU has been active in the field of democratization, promoting the establishment of representative institutions, free and fair elections, the participation of women in political life, the representation of minorities and the defence of human rights." <i>(<a href="../pdf/A-50-332.pdf">A/50/332</a>, para. 85)</i></div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa08">In the final Declaration adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union on 1 September 1995, in this very General Assembly Hall, as part of the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, the Union undertook to do its part in the task of making the ideal of the United Nations a reality. The Union also took on the commitment to help demonstrate that the United Nations could succeed in overcoming the challenges facing peoples on the threshold of the twenty-first century.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa09">Also on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, my country's Congress of Deputies, adopted, at its plenary meeting of 24 October 1995, a resolution entitled "New challenges and institutional reform of the United Nations". That resolution refers, among other things, precisely to the prospects for cooperation that are opening up for the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, emphasizing the desirability of the Union's giving the United Nations the necessary political support in areas such as the consolidation of democracy, human rights and peace-keeping.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa10">Dialogue and cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union already exist, but, in the judgement of my delegation, they need to be systematized, institutionalized and strengthened.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa11">My delegation, as one of the sponsors of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.20.pdf">A/50/L.20</a>, which was introduced by the representative of Egypt, believes that by adopting this text we will be taking a major step forward in improving the fruitful relationship between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. For the United Nations, it would undoubtedly be very useful to have stronger ties of dialogue and cooperation with the organization that brings national Parliaments together, while the Inter-Parliamentary Union would be able to develop its activities, in coordination with the work of the United Nations in areas of common interest.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa12">This cooperation could take a variety of forms, among which we might emphasize the promotion of democracy, electoral assistance, the protection of human rights and encouraging the economic and social development of peoples.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk01-pa13">The time would therefore appear to be ripe for better mutual awareness and greater cooperation and interaction between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union to emerge from the current understanding between the two organizations. We feel certain that this draft resolution will open the way to that strengthened cooperation between the two institutions and therefore recommend it to the General Assembly, which we hope will adopt it by consensus.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I wish to say at the outset that the Senegalese delegation fully supports the statement made this morning on behalf of all the sponsors, Senegal among them, by the representative of Egypt in introduction of the draft resolution before our Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">In adopting the draft resolution entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union", we will assuredly be acting to strengthen international cooperation and human solidarity, of which my country, Senegal, is an ardent supporter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Founded more than a century ago, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, as a world organization of national parliaments, was the first permanent forum for multilateral political negotiation. It has made an invaluable contribution to the rise of representative democracy throughout the world. At a time when the drive towards democratization is becoming increasingly essential to peace and development, it is fortunate that the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which is in the vanguard of the struggle for the democratic ideal, is establishing a special relationship with the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa04">We should not forget that the United Nations was established half a century ago on the vision of a world which, according to the very language of its Charter, is based on the ideals of democracy: peace, freedom, justice and economic and social advancement. Very fortunately, for some years now the consolidation of democracy has become one of the main tasks of the United Nations as it fulfils its various missions in the service of maintaining peace and promoting sustainable development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa05">That is why we are convinced that, in setting up an innovative and functional framework for cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the draft resolution before us gives us the means to establish fruitful dialogue with representatives of our parliaments as institutions of state power. We are aware of their basic role in implementing decisions we take in this forum.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa06">At a time when the United Nations is launching a vast reform process aimed at greater democratization in the work of its main organs and a better reflection of the objectives of economic and social development, it is fortunate that we can establish a closer relationship with the representatives of our Assemblies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa07">The draft resolution, whose adoption we commend, gives the Secretary-General a mandate -- as my Egyptian colleague recalled this morning -- to define a new and appropriate framework which, we hope, will break new ground in establishing a dynamic framework commensurate with the potential fruitful cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa08">The cooperation framework should extend not only to questions of consultation and coordination, but also to the granting of a status allowing for the effective representation and participation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, in appropriate forms, in the activities of the various United Nations bodies and for the forging of closer cooperation between the two organizations in areas of common interest, particularly those in which the Inter-Parliamentary Union has acquired recognized competence: representative democracy, human rights, the status of women and sustainable development.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa01">As a co-sponsor of the draft resolution before us, Italy wishes to voice its strong and convinced support for this document, which sets an appropriate and long-needed framework for increasing cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. We are especially grateful to the Permanent Representative of Egypt, Mr. Nabil Elaraby, for his clear, comprehensive and thoughtful introduction of the draft resolution. We are confident that the General Assembly will adopt it by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The Inter-Parliamentary Union is an organization of national parliaments. Currently, it has 135 members belonging to every geographical region of the world. Parliaments are the highest expression of the ideals of democracy within the structure of a State. Parliaments represent the people and their will is the will of the people. Parliaments are called on to perform fundamental tasks not only in the domestic domain, but also in international matters. They adopt laws and exercise control over Governments. They authorize the ratification of treaties, implement international law and determine state policy on international organizations. Today, in a world where States are more interdependent than independent, parliaments are called on to play an unprecedented role in international cooperation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Since its establishment more than a century ago, the Inter-Parliamentary Union has greatly contributed to international cooperation. Its action has been aimed at various objectives -- in particular, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the attainment of democracy and the safeguarding of human rights throughout the world. It has promoted free elections and democratic institutions, fostered the participation of women in political life and supported the protection of minorities. In other words, the Union has constantly worked to affirm the ideals and pursue the goals of modern international society.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Therefore, it is quite appropriate -- it is natural, to repeat the words recently used by the Secretary-General -- that the Inter-Parliamentary Union should today be in the front line of the struggle being waged by international institutions to meet the new aspirations to freedom and democracy that are rising in so many peoples and so many nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa05">The Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has called the Inter-Parliamentary Union a privileged partner of the United Nations in the effort to assert democratization in activities concerning both peace and development. We share this view, and we believe that to fully develop this partnership, an adequate basis should be provided in accordance with the terms of the draft resolution that we are considering this afternoon. The strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union will be highly beneficial to both institutions. But more than anything else, it will greatly contribute to reaffirming and implementing, on the threshold of the twenty-first century, the purposes and principles enshrined in our Charter.</div>

	Mr. Pérez-Otermin (Uruguay)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa01"></i>The General Assembly has often been compared to a world parliament, on the basis of the characteristics shared by national parliamentary bodies: the representative nature of their members, and their treatment of the topics most important to their societies through debate and legislative action. And many of those characteristics are indeed to be found in the work of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Without trying to equate two organs belonging to essentially different political systems, we cannot fail to ponder the implications of the expression "global parliament" during this very special year, the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Friday, 1 September 1995 saw the close of a special session of the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, opened at United Nations Headquarters by the Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. On that occasion, the IPU Council adopted a declaration entitled "Parliamentary vision for international cooperation into the twenty-first century", which contained a serious and important analysis of the challenges the United Nations will face in the coming millennium: problems of international peace and security, sustainable development, human rights and democracy, as well as the various options for increasing the dynamism of international cooperation in its many forms. It is the Member States that must meet these challenges faced by the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa04">The parliament, for its part, is one of the basic elements of the power of the State. Parliamentary decisions cover nearly every area of government; they often relate to international relations and are sometimes directly linked to the work of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Greater cooperation between these parliamentary institutions and the United Nations would make it possible for parliamentary decisions to bolster the activities of the Organization, thus making possible broad representation of States in the work of the United Nations. Greater cooperation here would make it possible for many of these challenges -- democracy and human rights, integration, development, international cooperation, and administrative matters such as the financing of the activities of the United Nations -- to be faced in optimal conditions and for there to be fluid channels of communication between the United Nations and national parliamentary bodies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa06">In its foreign policy, Uruguay follows what we choose to call a "State foreign policy", which means continuous, ongoing communication between the executive and legislative branches, so that our international activities will enjoy the broadest possible support of our national representatives.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa07">For all these reasons, Uruguay is among the sponsors of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.20.pdf">A/50/L.20</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Democratization of the United Nations is and must be the pole-star of the reform of the Organization, as repeatedly stated both by delegations and by the Secretary-General himself. Uruguay supports the draft resolution, as it is consistent with those purposes. The usefulness of strengthening the cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an organization possessing the broadest representation, is consistent with this position. The activities of the Union complement to some extent those of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa09">We are still celebrating the Organization's first 50 years. As the IPU declaration put it, we are propelling ourselves towards the twenty-first century. The parliaments of Member States are striving to fulfil basic principles that no one challenges today, principles that the peoples of the United Nations proudly proclaimed in their Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa10">More than ever before, we must hold fast to those principles now in these difficult times for the Organization as the orientation of any reform we might attempt. Democracy has always meant equality: equality of rights and of obligations for all Member States.</div>

We decided to do so because Chile firmly believes in the value of democracy as a cornerstone of peace and international coexistence, and a parliament is the very essence of any democratic regime.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The promotion of democracy is one of the principal goals of the United Nations, which sees it as the foundation of peace, security and development for peoples. Hence, the establishment of a cooperation agreement between the two organizations is a natural step.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa03">National Parliaments that gave life to the United Nations when they adopted the Charter, thus making its objectives of peace and cooperation the domestic law of the Member countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Today the United Nations is an international forum not just of sovereign States, but, increasingly, open to non-governmental organizations and all other forms in which civil society is represented. In this context, the Inter-Parliamentary Union should also have a special channel for participation in the work of the United Nations. This is consistent with the fact that it is an institution representing the Parliaments of the world, which, in turn, have the particular characteristic of embodying constitutionally the powers of the State.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">There are diverse areas in which this cooperation can take shape. Listing them would touch on virtually every aspect of United Nations activities, but there is one that is far too large to summarize: the promotion of the democratic ideal.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">For all of these reasons, my delegation trusts that the General Assembly will today adopt the draft resolution before it, as a way of reaffirming, in this United Nations fiftieth-anniversary year, its adherence to the cause of democracy in the world.</div>

My delegation firmly believes that the enhancement of such a cooperative relationship will have a salutary effect on the future of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The goals of the United Nations can be fulfilled only when the people of the world actively participate in global efforts to achieve peace and stability with a sense of commitment and dedication. The activities of the world Organization should therefore be reinforced not only by the political will and opinions of Governments, but also by those of individual citizens. In order to create a closer link between the general public and the United Nations, the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), as reflected in draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.20.pdf">A/50/L.20</a>, should be supported and encouraged without reservation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa03">As an organization representing the people of the world, the IPU has been a tireless peacemaker and advocate of the peaceful settlement of international disputes. It has a crucial role to play in advancing the goals of the United Nations, particularly because its members bring their vast experience and expertise to the task of promoting the globalization of democracy. Democratization is now an essential tool for strengthening the activities of the United Nations in the service of the international community.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa04">The IPU, as an inter-State organization, also plays a vital role in strengthening cooperation and understanding between States, thereby contributing to world peace. In view of the current trends of extremist nationalism and isolationism, which regrettably have resurfaced in some parts of the world, the IPU should take a leading role in renewing the international community's commitment to multilateral cooperation. The IPU could also make valuable contributions through promoting human contacts between members of various Parliaments and uniting them in pursuit of the common aspirations of international peace and prosperity, as embodied in the United Nations Charter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa05">It is well known that the IPU is instrumental in carrying out the work of the United Nations and implementing international commitments at the national level through its legislative activities. National Parliaments are an essential vehicle for ratifying international conventions and agreements, adopting laws which implement the decisions of States taken at the international level, monitoring governmental actions and approving State budgets, which has to do with contributions to international organizations such as the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa06">Through such actions, the political support of States can be extended to the United Nations in all fields, including peace-keeping and peace-building operations. Moreover, action taken by Parliaments is crucial to the enhancement of public awareness of the noble goals and principles which the United Nations pursues and in forging popular support for the United Nations. Given that closer cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU would significantly facilitate and mutually reinforce the work of both bodies, we hope that the forthcoming cooperation agreement between the United Nations and the IPU will contain provisions for consultation, active participation by the IPU in the political work of the United Nations and increasing cooperation between the two bodies in the fields of representative democracy, human rights, the status of women and sustainable development, where the IPU has been able to develop its expertise and excellence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa07">It is for these reasons that the Republic of Korea fully supports the development of a new framework for cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU as reflected in draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.20.pdf">A/50/L.20</a>, and the adoption of the draft resolution without a vote. We believe that the draft resolution is consistent with the common efforts of the global community to reinvent the United Nations so that it can better meet the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me to speak today on the agenda item entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The institutionalization of the links between our universal Organization and the organization that represents the elected leaders of the various peoples of the world is, first and foremost, a tribute to a prestigious institution created more than a century ago. It has not only gone through the upheavals of our time, but has also, above all, consolidated its foundations and increased its influence by bringing together representatives of the elected leaders of almost all States Members the United Nations. Institutionalizing the relationship between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a recognition of the role that that institution, through elected leaders of peoples, can play in promoting the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, bringing nations together, increasing understanding between people and consolidating democracy at the State level.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The cooperation that we hope will be established between the two organizations, can only be beneficial and serve the interests of our nations. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, with its representative and democratic vocation, will thus bring a new viewpoint to the activities of our Organization, enrich our discussions and broaden the horizons of world thinking within the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa04">In that regard, I should like to refer to a statement by Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on the occasion of the special session of IPU's Inter-Parliamentary Council held in New York on 30 August 1995.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa05">In his address, Secretary-General appealed for the establishment of special relations and a partnership between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union so that IPU could be more closely associated with the United Nations action. The Secretary-General went on to say:</div>
	<div class="blockquote" id="pg007-bk01-pa06">"You are a vital element in the representation of the world, and it is therefore important that you play your full part within the world Organization." <i>(SG/SM/5711)</i></div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa07">The revitalized cooperation called for by the Secretary-General is particularly desirable because it will enable the United Nations to perceive the problems and concerns of the peoples of our planet and their aspirations for sustainable development centred on human beings through a new vision, that of parliamentarians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa08">I would like to stress that the relations to be established between our universal Organization and the Inter-Parliamentary Union as a representative organization are consonant with the reforms now being undertaken by the United Nations with the aim <i>inter alia </i>of achieving better transparency and greater efficiency.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa09">The close links that the United Nations wishes to establish with other institutions such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union would involve these bodies in a more specific way in development activities conducted by the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa10">The Inter-Parliamentary Union, whose members come from the five continents, with all the cultural and human wealth that this implies, and which represents peoples that belong to the South and the North, will undoubtedly make an active contribution to the revival of international cooperation.</div>

	Mr. Matuszewski (Poland)

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa01">In expressing my delegation's support for the draft resolution on "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union", I should like to point out that adoption of that draft resolution by the General Assembly would be particularly meaningful in the year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Since the parliamentary system is the cornerstone of democracy, deepening of the cooperation between the United Nations and IPU would certainly prove instrumental in the fulfilment of the principal objectives of our Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa03">My delegation is convinced that the Inter-Parliamentary Union should assume an adequate role within the United Nations system. Widening the possibilities for the mutual expression of opinions in forums of the United Nations -- the world Organization of Governments -- and the Inter-Parliamentary Union -- the world organization of parliaments -- would serve primarily to assist the circulation of ideas between them as well as contribute to a better understanding of changes occurring in different countries and regions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Relations between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union should be based not only on the principles and objectives shared by the two organizations, but also on the awareness that programmes of the United Nations could hardly be effectively realized without the full support and understanding of the parliaments of United Nations Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We believe that, especially in the light of the noticeable development of representative institutions, there is a need to create adequate foundations for the improvement of cooperation between representatives of parliaments and Governments. The framework of such cooperation should enable them to exchange information on their activities, and it should also provide for mutual consultations as well as cooperation in the realization of concrete programmes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa06">The scope of the possible cooperation between the</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa07">two organizations may in particular cover the areas that constitute the focus of the Inter-Parliamentary Union's activities, such as representative democracy, human rights, the status of women, and sustainable development. We believe that specific activities of the two organizations aimed at the promotion of peace and international cooperation could be coordinated through consultations conducted more frequently, including participation by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the discussions at various United Nations conferences and meetings. We also think that in order to facilitate their cooperation, provision should be made for the appropriate exchange of information and documentation between the two organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa08">In closing, I should like to express once again the Polish delegation's approval of the idea of cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. For that reason, it has joined in sponsoring the draft resolution, whose aim is to provide the Secretary-General with a mandate to work out and conclude an agreement that would create a new and needed framework for cooperation between the two organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Poland remains convinced that a closer relationship between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union would be beneficial to both organizations. It would help them to fulfil their goals, to provide countries which are in the process of constructing or reconstructing their political systems with an additional opportunity to examine the experience of parliamentary democracies, and to make the latter more aware of the problems, needs and aspirations of their partners.</div>
