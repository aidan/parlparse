<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have the honour today to present to the General Assembly the reports of the Fifth Committee on the agenda items dealt with during the first part of the resumed fifty-third session of the General Assembly, which was held at Headquarters from 8 to 31 March 1999.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 112, entitled "Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations", the Committee considered the question of procurement reform in the United Nations. In this connection, the report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-521-Add.2">A/53/521/Add.2</a>. In paragraph 11 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution entitled "Procurement-related arbitration". In paragraph 12 of the same report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of two draft decisions concerning management irregularities causing financial losses to the Organization and procurement reform, respectively. The draft resolution and the two draft decisions were adopted by the Committee without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 113, entitled, "Programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999", the Committee considered the question of the Development Account and the financing of the Integrated Management Information System project. In this regard, the report of the Fifth Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-485-Add.2">A/53/485/Add.2</a>. In paragraph 13 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution concerning the Integrated Management Information System project and a draft resolution on the Development Account. In paragraph 14 of that report, the Committee recommends to the Assembly the adoption of a draft decision dealing with the question of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures. Both draft resolutions and the draft decision were adopted by the Committee without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 114, entitled "Programme planning", the report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-743-Add.1">A/53/743/Add.1</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft decision to transmit the note by the Secretariat on the programme performance of the United Nations for the biennium 1996-1997 to the Committee for Programme and Coordination for consideration at its thirty-ninth session. The oral decision was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 117, entitled "Pattern of conferences", the Committee considered three reports of the Secretary-General, namely, on the provision of interpretation services to meetings of the regional and other major groupings of Member States, on improved utilization of conference facilities at the United Nations Office in Nairobi and on the impact of economy measures on the delivery of mandated conference services. In this connection, the report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-744-Add.1">A/53/744/Add.1</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft decision to take note of the first two reports of the Secretary-General and to transmit the third one to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions for consideration in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001. This oral draft decision was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">Under agenda item 118, entitled "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations", the Committee considered the report of the Committee on Contributions on its special session, regarding the request for exemption to Article 19. In this connection, the report of the Fifth Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-464-Add.4">A/53/464/Add.4</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of an oral draft decision proposed by the Chairman of the Fifth Committee, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">The report on the Fifth Committee's consideration of agenda item 119, entitled "Human resources management", is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-748-Add.1">A/53/748/Add.1</a>. In paragraph 7 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution that was adopted by the Committee without a vote, as orally revised.</div>
	<div class="p">Regarding the question of gratis personnel, which was also considered under agenda item 112, the report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-533-Add.1">A/53/533/Add.1</a>. In paragraph 9 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution that was adopted by the Committee without a vote, as orally revised.</div>
	<div class="p">With regard to agenda item 141, entitled "Financing of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti and the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti", the report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-873">A/53/873</a>. In paragraph 6 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution that was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">Concerning agenda item 143 (a), entitled "Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations: financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations", in particular the question of death and disability benefits, the report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-522-Add.2">A/53/522/Add.2</a>. In paragraph 5 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly a draft decision to take note of the report of the Secretary-General on that question. The oral draft decision proposed by the Chairman of the Committee was adopted in the Committee by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">Concerning agenda item 145, entitled "Review of the implementation of General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-218">resolution 48/218</a> B", the report of the Committee is contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-891">A/53/891</a>, and in paragraph 4 of that report the Committee recommends to the General Assembly that it resume consideration of this agenda item at the second part of its resumed fifty-third session. This oral draft decision was adopted by the Committee by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p">Finally, allow me to thank members of the Secretariat for their valuable contribution to the work of the Committee, especially during the very late night meetings; and to address special thanks to the Secretariat team of the Fifth Committee, and especially to Mr. Joseph Acakpo-Satchivi, for their unflagging dedication to the success of the work of the Committee.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The Acting President: </b>The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Fifth Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records.</div>
	<div class="p">May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</div>
	<div class="p">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes.</div>
	<div class="p">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Fifth Committee.</div>

	<div class="blockquote"><b>Report of the Fifth Committee (Part III) (<a href="../pdf/A-53-521-Add.2">A/53/521/Add.2</a>)</b></div>

	<div class="p">I call on the representative of the United States of America, who wishes to make a statement in explanation of position.</div>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="3-11">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Bond" nation="United States" language="">
	Mr. Bond (United States)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">First of all, the United States regrets the deferral of procurement reform to the May session of the Fifth Committee -- a session, moreover, that should be devoted exclusively to consideration of peacekeeping issues.</div>
	<div class="p">Procurement is a management function in which efficiency and effectiveness can be measured in terms of dollars and in terms of implementation of programme objectives.</div>
	<div class="p">The Secretariat has made significant progress on procurement reform. The General Assembly should have given it due credit, for example, for increasing the percentage of procurements that were competitively bid; for dramatically improving the quality of Headquarters staff; and for relying less on assistance from Governments in peacekeeping procurement.</div>
	<div class="p">But more remains to be done. The Committee should highlight this for the Secretariat's attention. For example, the competitive bidding process needs further strengthening to ensure that vendors are given a reasonable time for submission of bids. Procurement staff in the field must be brought up to the same level of professionalism as Headquarters staff through training and rotational assignments. A system for measuring procurement performance should be established, for example, to measure timeliness in processing procurements.</div>
	<div class="p">The pending arbitration cases provide a stark example of the cost of the United Nations being unequipped to handle the large-scale urgent procurement required during the period of rapidly expanding peacekeeping operations. Adoption of this draft resolution will be a sign that the General Assembly wants assurances that systems are in place that will prevent or reduce reoccurrences of contract disputes of this nature.</div>
	<div class="p">Therefore, my delegation hopes that there will be expeditious action in May to adopt a comprehensive resolution on procurement reform.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The Acting President: </b>We turn first to the draft resolution entitled "Procurement-related arbitration", which the Fifth Committee adopted without a vote.</div>

	<div class="p">As the Assembly is aware, on 5 January we submitted a request to the President of the General Assembly that Honduras be exempted from the provisions of the first part of Article 19 of the Charter relating to the suspension of the right to vote in the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">Our primary justification at that time was that hurricane Mitch had had a devastating effect on Honduras at the end of 1998. The President of the General Assembly kindly referred our request to the Committee on Contributions for consideration. In the communication to which I referred, and in our presentation to the Committee on Contributions, we said that Honduras would make the necessary efforts to bring its payments to the United Nations up to date in the course of the year.</div>
	<div class="p">On Monday this week, we made the necessary payments to the Secretariat; several additional days will be required for the process to be completed. Accordingly, today we request that the name of our country be deleted from the decision now before the General Assembly under agenda item 118, entitled "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations".</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the support of the President of the General Assembly and for the understanding and goodwill of the Fifth Committee and of most of the members of the Committee on Contributions with regard to our request. However, we wish to express our disagreement with the comments concerning our country made by one member of the Committee on Contributions, reflected in the addendum to the Committee's report. We reject such comments as superficial and inaccurate, insofar as they denote a lack of awareness not only of the current situation in Honduras, but also of the sacrifices made by our authorities and our people in order to remain current in our obligations to the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p"><b>The Acting President: </b>Before we proceed further, I should like to repeat, for clarification, that the representative of Honduras proposed that his country's name be deleted from the text of the draft decision recommended by the Fifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report.</div>

The Group of 77 and China notes with concern the issues raised in the statement made by the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management on paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution on human resources management, contained in document A/C.5/53/SR.54, at the concluding meeting of the first part of the resumed fifty-third session of the Fifth Committee on 31 March 1999.</div>
	<div class="p">The Group of 77 and China is of the view that implementation of paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-748-Add.1">A/53/748/Add.1</a> should be in accordance with paragraph 2 of the same section of the draft resolution, which states,</div>

	Mr. Mabilangan (Philippines)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">While the Philippines has serious reservations on paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution contained in paragraph 7 of the report of the Fifth Committee in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-748-Add.1">A/53/748/Add.1</a>, it did not wish to stand in the way of facilitating the work of the Fifth Committee; nor does it wish to stand in the way of facilitating the work of the General Assembly this afternoon.</div>
	<div class="p">The Philippines, however, wishes to reaffirm that the staff is an invaluable asset of the Organization and commends the tireless efforts and dedication of staff in the furtherance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The Philippines pays tribute to all the staff members who have lost their lives in the service of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p">The Philippines is therefore deeply distressed that the draft resolution before us fails to recognize or even fully appreciate the important work and significant contribution of staff in the General Service and other categories to the effective functioning of this Organization. We deeply regret that their aspirations for upward mobility are not fully appreciated. We fully appreciate the extra efforts they make in obtaining, for example, a university degree at their own expense to enable them to qualify to take the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above. The opportunities for their promotion to the Professional category are already limited by the small number of posts set aside for the G-to-P examinations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Philippines deeply regrets that the window of opportunity for General Service staff based on nationalities may be closed to them because of the inclusion of the phrase "equitable geographical distribution" as part of the realignment of the national competitive examinations and the G-to-P examinations in paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution. It is our firm belief that the G-to-P examinations should be regarded as a promotion exercise and not as a recruitment exercise. As such, General Service staff of all nationalities must be given equal opportunities to be promoted, with a view to ensuring the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. It is further our firm belief that it is not the intent, in letter or spirit, of the General Assembly to take a decision that will in effect discriminate against certain General Service staff on the basis of their nationalities. In an Organization such as the United Nations discrimination based on nationality should not be tolerated.</div>

We urge the Secretary-General to provide this information at a later session before any amendments are made to the conditions under which General Service staff may take the examinations for promotion to the Professional category and above.</div>

This is the only precedent that has been set in this regard, and it had evolved into a practice which has served us well in the past.</div>
	<div class="p">It is also our understanding that the annual general debate will commence the following week, namely, on Monday, 20 September 1999.</div>
	<div class="p">In order to benefit from the presence of prominent world leaders at the United Nations during that time of the year and to encourage greater interaction among leaders from both the developed and the developing world, the JCC supports the convening of the special session to review the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States on 27 and 28 September 1999, as proposed in draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.76">A/53/L.76</a>, which is also before us.</div>
