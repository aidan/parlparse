In paragraph 9 of that report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of a draft resolution that was adopted by the Committee without a vote, as orally revised.</p>

	<p id="docA53PV97-pg003-bk04-pa01">First of all, the United States regrets the deferral of procurement reform to the May session of the Fifth Committee -- a session, moreover, that should be devoted exclusively to consideration of peacekeeping issues.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg003-bk04-pa02">Procurement is a management function in which efficiency and effectiveness can be measured in terms of dollars and in terms of implementation of programme objectives.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg003-bk04-pa03">The Secretariat has made significant progress on procurement reform. The General Assembly should have given it due credit, for example, for increasing the percentage of procurements that were competitively bid; for dramatically improving the quality of Headquarters staff; and for relying less on assistance from Governments in peacekeeping procurement.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg003-bk04-pa04">But more remains to be done. The Committee should highlight this for the Secretariat's attention. For example, the competitive bidding process needs further strengthening to ensure that vendors are given a reasonable time for submission of bids. Procurement staff in the field must be brought up to the same level of professionalism as Headquarters staff through training and rotational assignments. A system for measuring procurement performance should be established, for example, to measure timeliness in processing procurements.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg003-bk04-pa05">The pending arbitration cases provide a stark example of the cost of the United Nations being unequipped to handle the large-scale urgent procurement required during the period of rapidly expanding peacekeeping operations. Adoption of this draft resolution will be a sign that the General Assembly wants assurances that systems are in place that will prevent or reduce reoccurrences of contract disputes of this nature.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg003-bk04-pa06">Therefore, my delegation hopes that there will be expeditious action in May to adopt a comprehensive resolution on procurement reform.</p>

	<p id="docA53PV97-pg005-bk13-pa01">As the Assembly is aware, on 5 January we submitted a request to the President of the General Assembly that Honduras be exempted from the provisions of the first part of Article 19 of the Charter relating to the suspension of the right to vote in the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg005-bk13-pa02">Our primary justification at that time was that hurricane Mitch had had a devastating effect on Honduras at the end of 1998. The President of the General Assembly kindly referred our request to the Committee on Contributions for consideration. In the communication to which I referred, and in our presentation to the Committee on Contributions, we said that Honduras would make the necessary efforts to bring its payments to the United Nations up to date in the course of the year.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg005-bk13-pa03">On Monday this week, we made the necessary payments to the Secretariat; several additional days will be required for the process to be completed. Accordingly, today we request that the name of our country be deleted from the decision now before the General Assembly under agenda item 118, entitled "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations".</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg005-bk13-pa04">I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the support of the President of the General Assembly and for the understanding and goodwill of the Fifth Committee and of most of the members of the Committee on Contributions with regard to our request. However, we wish to express our disagreement with the comments concerning our country made by one member of the Committee on Contributions, reflected in the addendum to the Committee's report. We reject such comments as superficial and inaccurate, insofar as they denote a lack of awareness not only of the current situation in Honduras, but also of the sacrifices made by our authorities and our people in order to remain current in our obligations to the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk06-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The Group of 77 and China notes with concern the issues raised in the statement made by the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management on paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution on human resources management, contained in document A/C.5/53/SR.54, at the concluding meeting of the first part of the resumed fifty-third session of the Fifth Committee on 31 March 1999.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk06-pa02">The Group of 77 and China is of the view that implementation of paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-748-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/748/Add.1</a> should be in accordance with paragraph 2 of the same section of the draft resolution, which states,</p>

	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk06-pa04">In the light of the statement by Mrs. Rafiah Salim, the Group of 77 and China would like to request the Secretary-General to inform the General Assembly of the impact of, and any difficulties arising from, the implementation of paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-748-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/748/Add.1</a> to enable the General Assembly to revert to this issue.</p>

	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk07-pa01">While the Philippines has serious reservations on paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution contained in paragraph 7 of the report of the Fifth Committee in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-748-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/748/Add.1</a>, it did not wish to stand in the way of facilitating the work of the Fifth Committee; nor does it wish to stand in the way of facilitating the work of the General Assembly this afternoon.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk07-pa02">The Philippines, however, wishes to reaffirm that the staff is an invaluable asset of the Organization and commends the tireless efforts and dedication of staff in the furtherance of the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The Philippines pays tribute to all the staff members who have lost their lives in the service of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk07-pa03">The Philippines is therefore deeply distressed that the draft resolution before us fails to recognize or even fully appreciate the important work and significant contribution of staff in the General Service and other categories to the effective functioning of this Organization. We deeply regret that their aspirations for upward mobility are not fully appreciated. We fully appreciate the extra efforts they make in obtaining, for example, a university degree at their own expense to enable them to qualify to take the competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above. The opportunities for their promotion to the Professional category are already limited by the small number of posts set aside for the G-to-P examinations.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk07-pa04">The Philippines deeply regrets that the window of opportunity for General Service staff based on nationalities may be closed to them because of the inclusion of the phrase "equitable geographical distribution" as part of the realignment of the national competitive examinations and the G-to-P examinations in paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution. It is our firm belief that the G-to-P examinations should be regarded as a promotion exercise and not as a recruitment exercise. As such, General Service staff of all nationalities must be given equal opportunities to be promoted, with a view to ensuring the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. It is further our firm belief that it is not the intent, in letter or spirit, of the General Assembly to take a decision that will in effect discriminate against certain General Service staff on the basis of their nationalities. In an Organization such as the United Nations discrimination based on nationality should not be tolerated.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk07-pa05">In this regard, we support the statement made by the representative of Guyana, who spoke on behalf of the Group of 77 and China on paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution. We thank the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management for drawing attention to the implications of the inclusion of the phrase "equitable geographical distribution" in paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution. We reiterate our firm belief that there should be no distinction as to nationality, race, sex or religion in the promotion of staff, in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the provisions of the Staff Regulations and Rules.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg006-bk07-pa06">The Philippines fully supports the request of the Group of 77 and China that the Secretary-General inform the General Assembly of the full impact of, and any difficulties arising from, the implementation of paragraph 22 of section V of the draft resolution, to enable the General Assembly to revert to this issue. We urge the Secretary-General to provide this information at a later session before any amendments are made to the conditions under which General Service staff may take the examinations for promotion to the Professional category and above.</p>

	<p id="docA53PV97-pg009-bk04-pa01">In accordance with General Assembly decision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the Assembly elects the members of the Committee for Programme and Coordination upon their nomination by the Economic and Social Council. Members will recall that at its 43rd and 94th meetings, held on 26 October 1998 and 18 February 1999 respectively, the General Assembly elected seven members to the Committee for a term of office expiring on 31 December 2001, and that there remained one vacancy from a previous session from among the Western European and other States for a term of office beginning on the date of election and expiring on 31 December 1999.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg009-bk04-pa02">In this connection, the Assembly has before it document <a href="../pdf/A-53-440-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/440/Add.2</a> containing the nomination by the Economic and Social Council to fill that remaining vacancy in the Committee from among the Western European and other States.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg009-bk04-pa03">As indicated in that document the Economic and Social Council has nominated Portugal to fill the remaining vacancy from among the Western European and other States.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg009-bk04-pa04">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot. However, in accordance with paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, the Assembly may, in elections to subsidiary organs, dispense with secret balloting when the number of candidates corresponds to the number of seats to be filled.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg009-bk04-pa05">May I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes to declare Portugal elected a member of the Committee for Programme and Coordination for a term of office beginning on 7 April 1999 and expiring on 31 December 1999?</p>

	<p id="docA53PV97-pg010-bk05-pa02">The JCC has taken note of the President's proposal, as contained in draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.74.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/L.74</a>, which is before us, and we wish to inform the President that the JCC is prepared to consider his proposal favourably in the interests of reaching consensus on this matter. We therefore concur with his proposal that the fifty-third session shall close on Monday, 13 September 1999, and that the fifty-fourth session shall open on Tuesday, 14 September 1999.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg010-bk05-pa03">It is also our understanding that this exceptional arrangement will apply only to the opening date of the fifty-fourth session, and that the opening dates of future sessions of the General Assembly shall be the subject of further deliberations. In this context, I wish to reiterate the view of the JCC that we should revert to the provision in rule 1 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, namely, that each session shall commence on the third Tuesday in September. This is the only precedent that has been set in this regard, and it had evolved into a practice which has served us well in the past.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg010-bk05-pa04">It is also our understanding that the annual general debate will commence the following week, namely, on Monday, 20 September 1999.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg010-bk05-pa05">In order to benefit from the presence of prominent world leaders at the United Nations during that time of the year and to encourage greater interaction among leaders from both the developed and the developing world, the JCC supports the convening of the special session to review the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States on 27 and 28 September 1999, as proposed in draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.76.pdf" class="pdf">A/53/L.76</a>, which is also before us.</p>
	<p id="docA53PV97-pg010-bk05-pa06">Allow me to conclude by congratulating the President on the outcome of the extensive consultations that were conducted under his guidance.
