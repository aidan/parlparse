	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk13-pa01">As Co-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the High-level International Intergovernmental Event on Financing for Development, I should like, on behalf of the Bureau, to express our deep appreciation for the offer so generously made by Mexico to host the International Conference on Financing for Development. The Mexico venue for the Conference is emblematic of what this process is about. We fully trust that the Government of Mexico and its Mission here in New York will devote much energy and skill to the preparation and implementation of the Conference, which would be quite in keeping with the valuable role that Mexico has already played in the process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk13-pa02">Let me also thank other delegations, and in particular the delegation of Kenya and other African delegations, whose magnanimity and sense of commitment to the financing for development process made it possible for the decision on the venue for the Conference to be taken immediately upon receipt of the Mexican invitation, during our last Preparatory Committee meeting.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk13-pa03">Finally, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank you, Mr. President, for your strong personal support for the financing for development process.</div>
	</div>

	Mr. Navarrete (Mexico)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">Under your wise guidance, Mr. President, the General Assembly has just adopted a resolution that represents an important step forward in the preparatory process for the International Conference on Financing for Development. My delegation would like to express its gratitude for the sense of direction you have lent to the consideration of this issue. I would also like to thank the Co-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for his statement.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">The resolution that has just been adopted is simultaneously the culmination of one stage of the preparatory process and the beginning of another even more important and, without a doubt, more demanding phase. Taking advantage of this opportunity to raise international cooperation to a higher political level for the benefit of more equitable and humane development on a global scale will depend on the vision, will and sustained efforts of Member States.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">I would like to reiterate the firm commitment of the Government of Mexico that took office last December to the process that will culminate next year in the International Conference on Financing for Development. I would also like to reaffirm the high priority we attach to achieving substantive agreements to respond to the great expectations that have been raised by the convening of that meeting. We are committed to contributing to a process of discussion and negotiation that is open, participatory and based on a convergence of the efforts of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade Organization and many other relevant actors from every level and every sphere.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">That process should be devoid of confrontation and directed at identifying areas of agreement that will make it possible for the international community as a whole to agree on meaningful change in the world's trade and financial systems, to the benefit of development . In other words, our aim is to contribute to shaping a new global consensus to meet successfully the challenges of development by adopting financing as a strategic component.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">In that regard, my delegation would like to recall that Mexico will be the venue for the International Conference on Financing for Development thanks to the fact that a general agreement was reached to the effect that this would help raise the visibility and political profile of the Conference, thereby attracting higher-level delegations in which national leaders in the areas of foreign affairs, trade and finance would participate as well as leaders, at the highest political level during the summit stage. My country will serve as host of the Conference also as a result of general agreement that this would contribute to achieving a better outcome of the Conference by promoting more constructive and responsible debates, by providing a cordial and friendly atmosphere for the deliberations, and by fostering convergence of views and consensus.</div>
