	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council condemns the 3 October attack in Baghdad against the Polish Ambassador to Iraq, which resulted in the wounding of the Ambassador and the killing of one member of his personal security detachment team and injuries to two others.

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council underlines the need to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this act to justice and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate with the Governments of Poland and Iraq in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council also calls on the international community to support the Government of Iraq in exercising its responsibility in providing protection to the diplomatic community in Iraq, United Nations staff and other foreign civilian personnel working in Iraq.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. The Council reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-36.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/36</a>.</p>
