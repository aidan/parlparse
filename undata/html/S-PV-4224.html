	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council encourages all parties to cooperate in promoting reconciliation, so that the objectives of the Townsville Peace Agreement can be met, and urges all parties to continue to cooperate in accordance with the Townsville Peace Agreement, namely, to restore and maintain peace and ethnic harmony, to renounce the use of armed force and violence, to settle their differences through consultation and peaceful negotiation and to confirm their respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council commends those countries in the region that have supported the resolution of the conflict, and welcomes the establishment, as outlined in the Townsville Peace Agreement, of the International Peace Monitoring Team composed of unarmed military personnel and civilian police from Australia and New Zealand, the mandate of which is based on Annex II of the said Agreement and agreed by the parties. It also encourages other nations, in particular those in the region, to participate and assist in the implementation of this peace agreement."</p>
