	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01"> The General Assembly will today take up the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 82 to 97, 110 and 118.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">I now request the Rapporteur of the First Committee, Mr. Abdelhamid Gharbi of Tunisia, to introduce the reports of the First Committee in one intervention.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg001-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gharbi</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa01">It gives me great pleasure to introduce to the General Assembly the reports of the First Committee on agenda items 82 to 97, 110 and 118. Those reports are contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-61-386.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/386</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-61-403.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/403</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa02">In response to the General Assembly's appeal, the First Committee continued to fully utilize its existing resources and was able to conclude its work at the current session in four weeks. The work of the Committee at the present session could be characterized as having been procedurally smooth and substantively constructive, more focused and action-oriented.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa03">The First Committee had before it 53 draft resolutions and two draft decisions submitted for its consideration under various disarmament and related international security agenda items. One draft resolution, <a href="../pdf/AC.1-61-L.23.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.1/61/L.23</a>, was eventually withdrawn. As at the previous sessions, the whole complex of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues, were by far the most important subject. Out of the 54 draft resolutions and draft decisions adopted, 17 were devoted to nuclear issues.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa04">While the statements made by delegations were focused on issues of nuclear non-proliferation and small arms, they also revealed increasing concern over the dangers posed by existing stockpiles of weapons in general and weapons of mass destruction in particular. This led to a reconsideration by Member States of positions on disarmament and security issues with a view to redoubling their efforts aimed at substantive and urgent disarmament measures.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa05">The new action-oriented approached was especially evident in the course of discussions on the entire complex of nuclear weapons issues. Thus, Member States increasingly focused on the aspects of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament that should be addressed on a priority basis in the immediate future.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa06">In this context, delegations focused on further efforts necessary to scale down nuclear weapons at both unilateral and bilateral levels. They noted that in the atmosphere of high expectation which preceded the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and disappointment with its inability to produce a consensus substantive outcome, it is even more important to take a fresh look at nuclear disarmament in general with a view to adopting an innovative approach at the forthcoming meetings of the Preparatory Committee for the next Review Conference, which are to be held in Vienna in 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa07">The necessity for fundamental reconsideration of strategic doctrines and operative military postures was repeatedly stressed. In that connection, practical measures to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists were highly visible. Those concerns were reflected in a number of draft resolutions, such as those entitled "Renewed determination towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons", "Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments", "Reducing nuclear danger", "Nuclear disarmament" and so on.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa08">In a number of draft resolutions -- such as those entitled "Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia", "Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East", "Mongolia's international security and nuclear-weapon-free status" and "Nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere and adjacent areas" -- continued wide support for the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones was expressed, and calls were made to create new zones as a step leading to a world without nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa09">Member States also expressed their hope for the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa10">The majority of delegations spoke of the lost opportunities within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament. The need for further focused negotiations aimed at establishing effective international arrangements for a legally binding instrument regarding a fissile material cut-off treaty and security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States continued to be an important subject in the dialogue on security issues. However, the withdrawal of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/AC.1-61-L.23.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.1/61/L.23</a> clearly demonstrated the existing confusion with regard to a fissile material cut-off treaty.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa11">As far as other weapons of mass destruction were concerned, wide support was expressed for measures to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention. At the same time, Member States continued to be optimistic in the light of the Sixth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention, which is being held from 20 November to 8 December in Geneva.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa12">While retaining their traditional aspects, regional and conventional disarmament have attained a new dimension that requires urgent and decisive actions, with particular reference to the problem of small arms and light weapons. The draft resolution on that subject enjoyed wide support. Speakers called on all States to implement the Programme of Action adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa13">Let me now briefly turn to the reports of the First Committee and draw the attention of delegations to some additions, as well as to a few technical errors that have crept into the text of the following documents.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa14">First, with regard to <a href="../pdf/A-61-394.pdf" class="pdf">document A/61/394</a>, which was issued under agenda item 90, the footnote to paragraph 9, relating to the Committee's action on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/AC.1-61-L.4.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.1/61/L.4</a>, should read as follows: "The representative of Tonga subsequently informed the Committee that she had intended not to participate in the action on the draft resolution".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa15">Secondly, with regard to <a href="../pdf/A-61-403.pdf" class="pdf">document A/61/403</a>, issued under agenda item 118, paragraph 2 should read as follows: "The need did not arise for the First Committee to take up this item in the main part of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa16">At this stage, I would like to draw attention to the fact that there are a number of mostly editorial errors in some of the reports, which will require correction. In order to save time, we will not take them up here; rather they will be corrected by the Secretariat in due course.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa17">Before I conclude, I should like to pay well-deserved tribute to all delegations for their active participation in the work of the First Committee and for their spirit of cooperation in the common search for a better, safer and more stable world. I should like to express special gratitude to the Chairperson of the First Committee, Ambassador Mona Juul, who, with her intimate knowledge of disarmament and international security matters, as well as her general diplomatic skills, led the proceedings of the First Committee with vision and able leadership. Let me also, on behalf of the Committee and my own account, extend sincere gratitude to the Committee's Vice-Chairmen -- Mr. Andy Rachmianto of Indonesia, Mr. Bostjan Malovrh of Slovenia and Mr. Federico Perazza of Uruguay -- for their most effective contribution to the work of the Committee. I should also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Nobuaki Tanaka, Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, and Mr. Chen Jian, Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Management, for the leadership they provided the Secretariat staff assisting the Committee and for their valuable contributions. Moreover, special thanks go to Mr. Jarmo Sareva, Secretary of the First Committee, whose vast experience and high degree of competence made a significant contribution to the successful outcome of the Committee's work. I should also like to express my gratitude to other officers of the Secretariat for their valuable assistance in the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk05-pa18">With those brief remarks, I present the reports of the First Committee, as contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-61-386.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/386</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-61-403.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/403</a>, to the General Assembly for consideration and approval.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01"> Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">The position of delegations regarding the recommendations of the First Committee have been made clear in the Committee, and are reflected in the relevant official records.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">May I remind members once again that, in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that, is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee, and that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made from delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the First Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Committee, unless the Assembly is notified otherwise in advance. That means that where separate or recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the First Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">Before proceeding further, I would like to draw the attention of members to a note by the Secretariat entitled "Situation reports of the First Committee on agenda items 82 to 97", which has been circulated as <i>(document A/C.1/61/INF/2)</i>. That note has been distributed desk-to-desk in the General Assembly Hall as the reference guide for action on draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the First Committee in its reports. In that connection, members will find in column 2 of the note the numbers of the draft resolutions or decisions of the First Committee, with the corresponding numbers for action in the plenary in column 5 of the same note.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk05-pa02">An arms race in outer space would pose a grave danger to international peace and security. Cuba therefore believes that it is both appropriate and necessary to continue to develop transparency and confidence-building measures at the international level with regard to outer space. Such measures would contribute to the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to the promotion of international cooperation. By taking concrete measures, such as prior notification, verification and follow-up, it would be possible to achieve greater transparency and predictability in outer space activities.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa02">As delegations are aware, the draft resolution is coordinated annually on a rotational basis among Colombia, Japan and South Africa, and was this year introduced by my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa03">The proposed oral correction is purely technical in nature. It was raised with the coordinators by the Official Records Editing Section and relates to operative paragraph 2 of the text of the draft resolution. The Editing Section pointed out, quite correctly, that the words "a final report" should, in fact, be replaced by the words "an outcome document". That is, indeed, a more accurate reflection of the result of the Review Conference referred to in operative paragraph 2.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa04">While a report was indeed issued at the end of the Review Conference, it was merely of a procedural nature, and there was, of course, no outcome document appended to that report.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa05">The proposed revised operative paragraph 2 of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/AC.1-61-L.15.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.1/61/L.15</a> would then read as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa06">"<i>Regrets</i> the fact that the Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action was not able to agree to conclude an outcome document".</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk04-pa07">As this proposed oral correction in no way changes the substance of either operative paragraph 2 or the draft resolution as a whole, my delegation trusts that it will enjoy consensus.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg032-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Weisleder</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa01">First, on behalf of my delegation, I wish to congratulate the General Assembly on having adopted the set of resolutions under agenda item 90, "General and complete disarmament". We voted in favour of all the resolutions under this item.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa02">I wish to illustrate our pleasure at the adoption of those resolutions by referring specifically to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-89.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/89</a>, on the adoption of a treaty on the conventional arms trade. Costa Rica welcomes this memorable occasion. The General Assembly has approved the promotion of an idea that we have long cherished. As is well known, my country eliminated the army and all forms of military expenditure nearly 60 years ago. Since then, Costa Rica has advanced the cause of peace, which is a legacy from our ancestors. To that end, President scar Arias Snchez, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987, has made every effort since 1995 to promote the adoption of an international instrument regulating the conventional arms trade.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa03">We believe that the resolution just adopted by the Assembly is a first step in the attainment of that objective. We wish to attest to the excellent work accomplished as a result of the efforts of a group of members of Permanent Missions, the support of a number of enlightened Governments and, in particular, the leadership shown by the delegation and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Thanks to that leadership, the resolution reached this present stage.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa04">We understand that regulating the international trade in conventional arms calls for great flexibility and openness. It is not possible to ignore the legitimate concerns of Governments and citizens in combating crime and criminals. Frequently, they have no scruples and are not held back by laws or respect for the rights of others, even for the most innocent and disabled.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa05">In adopting this resolution, we show our unfailing determination to do everything possible to prevent criminals and their unscrupulous suppliers from being able to act with impunity. We hope that, in the not too distant future, Governments will be able to achieve the coordination needed and take the steps to achieve this goal. We need systematic control of information and minimum standards to be applied in this regard. We need to act in terms of both supply and demand in this market.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa06">We trust that, with the adoption of this resolution, the door will be opened for serious work that will show the viability of an international legal instrument that would contribute to effectively reducing the increasing levels of violence throughout the world.</p>

This is of particular importance since our consideration of agenda items 91 and 92 will involve the adoption of a number of draft resolutions.</p>
