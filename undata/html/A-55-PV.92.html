	<div class="p">I should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to document <a href="../pdf/A-55-745-Add.2">A/55/745/Add.2</a>. In the letter contained in that document, the Secretary-General informs the President of the General Assembly that, since the issuance of his communications contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-55-745">A/55/745</a> and addendum 1, Sierra Leone has made the necessary payment to reduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of the Charter.</div>

	<div class="p">As members are aware, the draft resolution before us is the result of long and arduous negotiations. The two facilitators, Ambassador Penny Wensley of Australia and Ambassador Ibra Deguène Ka of Senegal, and delegations worked very hard to reach a consensus in a constructive way.</div>
	<div class="p">I should now like to consult the Assembly with a view to considering immediately draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.76">A/55/L.76</a>. In this connection, since document <a href="../pdf/A-55-L.76">A/55/L.76</a> has been circulated only this morning, it would be necessary to waive the relevant provisions of rule 78 of the rules of procedure, which reads as follows:</div>
	<div class="blockquote">"As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed or put to the vote at any meeting of the General Assembly unless copies of it have been circulated to all delegations not later than the day preceding the meeting."</div>
