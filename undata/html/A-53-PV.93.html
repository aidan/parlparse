Members will recall that 37 items were allocated for consideration by the Fifth Committee. The Committee considered 24 items during the main part of the fifty-third session of the General Assembly. The remaining items allocated to the Committee will be considered during the resumed fifty-third session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">From 5 October to 15 December 1998, the Fifth Committee held 45 meetings. Moreover, negotiations were carried out in the course of numerous informal consultations. I shall today give a brief report on the results of the work of the Fifth Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">Let me recall first of all that the Fifth Committee has already submitted reports under a number of items that were considered in October and November, including the following. Under agenda item 112, "Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations", the Committee has reported on administrative arrangements for the International Trade Centre, on the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), on the World Trade Organization, on gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities, and on the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions on its activities during the fifty-second session. Under agenda item 113, "Programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999", the Committee has reported on the programme budget implications of the special session of the Committee on Contributions in 1999 and on the savings achieved from the ninth session of UNCTAD, as well as on the programme budget implications of draft resolution I recommended by the Third Committee in its report contained in <a href="../pdf/A-53-623.pdf" class="pdf">document A/53/623</a>, entitled "International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination", and of <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.20.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/53/L.20</a> on the situation in Central America, entitled "United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala".</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Shearouse</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa01">The United States cannot join the agreement reached on the $2.545 billion budget outlined for the biennium 2000-2001. We do not accept a budget outline level that is both greater than the current budget level and much more than is necessary to carry out all mandated programmes efficiently and effectively. It is our belief that an outline level equal to or lower than the current budget would have enabled full implementation of mandated activities, including real increases in several priority areas; reflected the likelihood of at least $20 million in efficiency savings in the next biennium as a result of improvements in efficiencies in United Nations operations; and provided resources for the special political missions that may be undertaken during the course of the budget period.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa02">Despite clear indications that a budget less than the current level would be sufficient for the next biennium, the proposed resolution endorses an outline level that substantially exceeds this. Actual spending for the first year of the current biennium was well below the approved budget level. To increase the projected expenditure level above the current approved level, which itself exceeds the actual spending pattern, is simply irresponsible.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa03">We also cannot agree to a budget outline that rejects the Secretary-General's proposal to achieve $20 million in savings through efficiency gains -- a tiny amount when compared with the overall budget total. This capricious approach goes against Article 97 of the United Nations Charter, which gives the Secretary-General responsibility for administering the Organization in the most efficient and effective ways possible.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa04">In truth, any budget totalling $2.5 billion would easily contain substantially more than $20 million in savings opportunities. The original proposal would have made such savings a distinct part of the budget proposal. While this approach was not embraced, we fully expect the Secretary-General to identify efficiency savings when proposing his budget for the biennium 2000-2001.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa05">Approving a higher budget outline level than is justified on technical and programmatic grounds has set an unfortunate precedent. Given this situation, one can only conclude that there are other forces at play that gave rise to such an extraordinary and expensive action.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa06">We would only add that we look forward to reviewing the Secretary-General's detailed budget estimates next year. These estimates should fully reflect the benefits of the reform and efficiency measures while also providing a realistic perspective on the United Nations resource requirements for the biennium.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk14">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Powles</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk14-pa01">This brief explanation of position on the resolution on results-based budgeting is being delivered on behalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In addition, the delegations of the following countries have asked to be associated with it: the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu -- in all, 10 Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk14-pa02">Our delegations have joined in the consensus on the resolution on results-based budgeting in support of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions that the Secretary-General should provide additional prototype budget fascicles in a results-based budgeting format. We believe that, in order for the General Assembly to have more technical information at hand when considering this matter next year, paragraph 7 of the resolution is essential.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk14-pa03">Our delegations also agreed with the wish of other delegations that the Secretary-General should provide additional justification for his recommendation to move to results-based budgeting. However, our delegations retain some concern that many of the paragraphs in this resolution seem to prejudge the outcome of the comparative analysis that the General Assembly is requesting of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk14-pa04">It is our delegations' hope that, when the General Assembly takes up this matter again at its fifty-fourth session, the receipt of additional information requested will foster a well-informed and constructive discussion on results-based budgeting. This discussion should be based on technical aspects, but, at the same time, it affects the future health of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk14-pa05">Our delegations would be grateful if the Secretary-General would note that, while there is understandable uncertainty on the part of some delegations concerning his recommendation in the United Nations reform programme on results-based budgeting, there is also firm and unwavering support for the concept on the part of many delegations. We reiterate here the utmost importance that our delegations attach to the proper consideration of results-based budgeting in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk14-pa06">Like other Member States, we seek a more credible United Nations. We fear that, if the United Nations management and administrative machinery is not modernized and strengthened, this Organization runs a serious risk of being unable to respond to the growing needs of the international community in the new century. If that were to be the case, all Member States would suffer, particular developing countries and small States. My own country is obviously in that category. We are the ones that rely most on the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk14-pa07">Therefore, our delegations will continue to support the gradual transition to a results-based budgeting system for the United Nations, for it is in this system that the seeds of a much more effective Organization can be found.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Schlesinger</span> <span class="nation">Austria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 41/213</a> because it wished to improve the financial and administrative functioning of the Organization and to facilitate the agreement among Member States on the programme budget. The concept of a budget outline was introduced and has since been a pillar of the budgetary process. It is for this reason that we attach great importance to it. The European Union was therefore pleased to join consensus on the present resolution after much work and welcome flexibility on the part of many delegations to reach the broadest possible agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">This is not to say that we were fully satisfied with all elements of the text. In particular, like others, we would have preferred to have retained in the outline the $20 million which the Secretary-General expects to be able to save through economies achieved by intense scrutiny of the programme budget. It is our view that this is by no means an unreasonable target for such economies in a budget of this size and we trust that the Secretary-General will continue to apply such scrutiny when preparing the budget he will propose next year. Of course, it goes without saying that such economies should be sought only in the context of full and effective financing for the implementation of mandated programmes and activities.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">We welcome the resolution we have just adopted, which reaffirms <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 41/213</a>. It effectively reverses calls for deviations made in the past for political reasons. In this context, we are particularly pleased to see the reaffirmation that a contingency fund in the amount of 0.75 per cent is additional to the overall budget figure, as specified in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 41/213</a>. We also appreciate that the budget outline now contains a provision for special missions, as recommended by the Secretary-General and the Advisory Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The European Union has long agreed with the view of the Secretary-General that previous arrangements in this regard were an unsatisfactory basis for organizing the future management of resources for such missions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">It is unfortunate that some delegations remain unhappy with this resolution, which was adopted without a vote. But we expect that the procedures stipulated in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 41/213</a> and the spirit of consensus underpinning it will continue to guide our work when we come to discuss the Secretary-General's budget proposal, for which this resolution provides an indicative planning estimate.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Buergo Rodríguez</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">My delegation joined the consensus on <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-206.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/206</a> on the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 2000-2001, which we have just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">However, my delegation would like to make a few brief comments, particularly in connection with some concerns expressed by my delegation during the informal consultations, which, in the interest of consensus, we did not press.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">First of all, we would like to reaffirm that the budget outline is a preliminary estimate of resources, and is in no way a budget ceiling. Furthermore, we note the inclusion in the total amount approved of an amount relating to special political missions, which in our opinion departs from the provisions established in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 41/213</a>. That issue will have to be considered very carefully in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">Finally, my delegation is concerned about the trend towards a diminution of the resources of the Organization and the increasing difficulty of ensuring sufficient resources to allow for the complete and proper implementation of all the mandates, activities and programmes in the medium-term plan. In this context, my delegation hopes that during negotiations next session under the item on the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, the General Assembly will be able to ensure and approve the amount of resources really necessary to implement all of the mandated activities and programmes of the Organization.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Wensley</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I am pleased to join the hard-working Fifth Committee experts at this important plenary meeting. I have the honour to speak on behalf of the delegations of Canada, New Zealand and Australia in explanation of position following the adoption of the draft resolution, contained in the Fifth Committee's report, on the proposed budget outline for the biennium 2000-2001.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">The adoption of an outline for the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 represents an important first stage in the budgetary process. It sets the parameters within which the Secretary-General will prepare his budget proposals for the next biennium. In providing an indicative level of the next budget, it can be a critical planning tool for Member States. We are pleased that, for the first time, the outline includes a provision for special political missions. This will ensure a reliable funding base for these important activities and reduce the extent to which Member States could face unforeseen expenditures during the biennium. This, we believe, is a significant enhancement of the budgetary process.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Our three delegations are disappointed, however, that the outline does not take into account the efficiencies of $20 million proposed by the Secretary-General. We considered the amount of $20 million to be modest in a budget of more than $2.5 billion. Nevertheless, it is our understanding that the Secretary-General will pursue gains in productivity in the preparation of the next budget and subsequently in its implementation. We look forward to the results of that effort.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">A key element of the outline is the preliminary estimate of the resource requirements for the next biennium. We note that the figure contained in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-206.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/206</a> is higher than the current level of appropriations and -- I want to emphasize this -- higher than our delegations consider to be financially prudent, particularly given the financial climate in some parts of the world. We recognize that agreement on the estimate was reached after sensitive and difficult negotiations, which entailed significant concessions from many delegations. However, the fact that the preliminary estimate was too high to be endorsed by the United States and Japan is a source of serious concern for our delegations. We believe that the very legitimate concerns of those two Member States, which together contribute 45 per cent of the total resources of this Organization, need to be addressed. We believe it important for this to be done in the context of next year's negotiations on the programme budget for 2000-2001 and, for our part, we are prepared to work to help bring that about.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Our delegations remain strongly committed to strengthening the effectiveness and the work of the United Nations. We view fiscal restraint and the focused use of resources as essential elements in the broader reform process. We trust that, in preparing the budget based on the outline adopted today, the Secretary-General will consolidate his reforms and continue to work actively and energetically to streamline processes and structures to allow more resources to be invested in substantive programmes.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Manz</span> <span class="nation">Austria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia -- and the associated country Cyprus, as well as the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area -- Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway -- align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa02">First, I would like to thank the representative of Ireland, Mr. Frank Smyth, for his outstanding work as coordinator of this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa03">The European Union is pleased that we have adopted by consensus <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-36.pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 53/36</a> B to E, dealing with the report of the Committee on Contributions, whose good work is rightly acknowledged. There remains, however, much more to be done in pursuit of the European Union's long-held objective of making the system of financing our Organization both more transparent and more equitable.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa04">It is right that the Committee on Contributions should be instructed to look at ways in which the application of Article 19 might be tightened. By this we mean that the effective arrears period should be brought into line with the original intent of those who drafted this Article. Member States should risk the sanction of the loss of their vote in the General Assembly if they are in default of their obligations after a real two-year period, not the almost three years that presently applies.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa05">It is for this reason that we would like to see the Committee on Contributions give specific advice on the impact of doing the calculation twice a year rather than just once, in early January, as is currently the case. We also believe that it should look closely at the consequences of using net rather than gross figures in the calculation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa06">The European Union continues to believe that it is fundamentally unacceptable that so many Member States should make a habit of systematically being in arrears. Too many deliberately pay at the last possible moment; some make no payments at all. In such circumstances, we look to the Committee on Contributions for advice on what measures might be imposed to serve as a real disincentive to such poor performance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa07">I have already recalled that it has long been an important objective of the European Union to make the scales of assessment more equitable. In this context, we regret that we were once again prevented from even discussing our proposals to bring a more rational system to bear on the financing of peacekeeping operations. We believe that the technical advice of the Committee on Contributions would be valuable in this area and find it unacceptable that a straightforward request for the Committee's help should effectively be blocked by one group of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa08">Under the current system for financing United Nations peacekeeping operations, group D countries receive a 90 per cent discount and group C countries a discount of 80 per cent. It is not this particular system which itself gives us great cause for concern at this stage. Indeed, we want to discuss how it might be improved. Rather, we are concerned by the fact that too many countries continue to receive an 80 per cent discount as a result of a calculation of their relative share of world gross national product in 1973, some 25 years ago. We believe that it is unacceptable that some of these countries continue to gain an unwarranted subsidy at the expense not only of those that pay fully and promptly, but also of those countries that -- were there to be a change to the group system -- would deservedly benefit from it.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk14-pa09">In the parliaments of the countries of the European Union, this situation is increasingly being questioned. It is not something that should be allowed to continue. Moreover, we are not prepared to accept that we are denied an opportunity to discuss the problem. We reserve the right to return to this issue at the resumed fifty-third session, under agenda item 143, "Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations".</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Allow me to state the following on behalf of my colleagues members of the Group of 77 and China.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The Group of 77 and China joined the consensus on the adoption of this resolution, but not without great disappointment. We are very much concerned about the spirit under which this resolution was negotiated. Therefore, we are of the view that any mistrust and doubt should be avoided. Furthermore, we continue to hold our long-standing view that it is irrelevant to link the discussion of this agenda item with the special scale for the peacekeeping operations budget.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">We are also of the view that the Committee on Contributions does not have the mandate to discuss the special scale for the peacekeeping operations budget.

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I wish to thank the representative of New Zealand, who did a wonderful job of coordinating the item on which the Assembly has just taken a decision. My delegation has a particular interest in this item and would therefore like to make some brief comments. We are particularly happy to note that the General Assembly has taken the decision to establish an expert group to evaluate the operation and functioning of the Tribunals for Rwanda and for the former Yugoslavia. It is the view of my delegation that the expert group will be able to assess the effectiveness of the Tribunals and the way in which they have been functioning since their establishment. We hope that its report will be useful in helping all the concerned organs of the United Nations as they try to take the steps necessary to improve the effective functioning of the Tribunals.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We are also happy to note that the resolution we have just adopted takes note that efforts are being made by the Office of Human Resources Management to review the current remuneration package applicable to staff of the Tribunal. We hope that this will go a long way towards encouraging more staff to work in the Tribunal and to fill the vacancies there, which we have noted are very high.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">Finally, allow me to say that aspersions have been cast as to the appreciation extended to the management of the Tribunal on the functioning of the Tribunal in Arusha. Those of us who are quite close to the Tribunal and who have been following its development believe that many efforts have been made to try to put it on a proper footing, and although not all is totally perfect, we believe that the efforts made to date should be appreciated. We are very pleased that the Committee and the General Assembly have recognized this effort, and we want to send a clear message to the management of the Tribunal that it should continue its work and strive harder to make the Tribunal more effective.</p>
