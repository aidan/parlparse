	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Burundi, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now resume its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council took note with satisfaction of the declaration signed on 15 May 2005 in Dar es Salaam by the President of Burundi, Mr. Domitien Ndayizeye, and by the leader of the rebel group of Palipehutu-FNL, Mr. Agathon Rwasa. The Council took note in particular of the commitment by both parties to immediately cease hostilities, agree within a month on a permanent ceasefire, and negotiate without disturbing the electoral process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council shares the understanding that this declaration is a first step that should allow FNL to be rapidly integrated, in a negotiated manner, into the transitional process currently in progress in Burundi. The Council remains convinced that FNL's participation in this process will facilitate the holding of the forthcoming elections, in accordance with the timetable confirmed at the last meeting of member States of the Regional Initiative for Peace in Burundi, on 22 April 2005 in Entebbe.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council commends the mediation of President Benjamin Mkapa and of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania and, more generally, the efforts of States of the Regional Initiative chaired by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and of the Facilitation led by South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma, as well as those made by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, to bring the peace and national reconciliation process in Burundi to a successful conclusion. The Council reiterates that bringing an end to the climate of impunity in Burundi and the Great Lakes region is essential to that process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council urges all Burundian parties to exert greater efforts to ensure success of the transition, national reconciliation and stability of the country in the longer term."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
