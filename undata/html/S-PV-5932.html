	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the special report of the Secretary-General pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1806(2008).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1806 (2008)</a> on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-434.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/434</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the special report of the Secretary-General on the International Conference in Support of Afghanistan, held in Paris on 12 June 2008 (<a href="../pdf/S-2008-434.pdf" class="pdf">S/2008/434</a>), and on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), as well as the briefing by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan, Mr. Kai Eide, on 9 July 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the outcome of the Conference, including the generous financial pledges made in support of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) and the commitment by the Government of Afghanistan to promote security, good governance, the rule of law, human rights and socio-economic development, and to pursue political and economic reform, including by taking concrete steps to combat corruption. The Council welcomes the strengthened partnership between the Afghan Government and the international community resulting from such mutual pledges and commitments. The Security Council endorses the key elements identified in the Paris Declaration as essential for the security and prosperity of the Afghan people, including the importance of holding free, fair and secure elections in 2009 and 2010, the importance of ensuring respect for the human rights of all Afghans and the provision of humanitarian assistance, and the need to improve aid effectiveness in order to ensure that the benefits of development are tangible for every Afghan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council also welcomes the review of the Afghanistan Compact presented at the Conference. In this regard, the Council reiterates its call on the Afghan Government and the international community to implement the Afghanistan Compact and its annexes in full.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council recalls the strengthened role of UNAMA and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in leading and coordinating international civilian efforts in Afghanistan through an integrated approach and guided by the principle of reinforcing Afghan ownership and leadership. The Council reaffirms in particular the priorities for UNAMA and the Special Representative identified in paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1806(2008).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1806 (2008)</a> and endorses the views of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative on the areas that require greater attention. The Council calls on all relevant actors to give their full support to UNAMA's enhanced coordinating role.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council endorses the recommendation that, in order for UNAMA to fulfil its mandate, much greater substantive, administrative and security resources will need to be expeditiously mobilized in the areas mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General, through the relevant processes and procedures within the United Nations system. The Council welcomes in particular the intention to proceed, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1806(2008).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1806 (2008)</a>, with another expansion of UNAMA's field presence through the opening of six new provincial offices over the next 12 months. The Council also welcomes plans to improve the coherence of action of the United Nations Country Team in support of UNAMA's priorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reaffirms once again its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan. The Council expresses its strong concern about the security situation in Afghanistan and stresses the need to continue to address the threat to the security and stability of Afghanistan posed by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, illegal armed groups, criminals and those involved in the narcotics trade and in the diversion of chemical precursors, including through the implementation of measures introduced in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> and other relevant resolutions of the Council. The Security Council notes the links between illicit drugs trafficking, corruption and terrorism, and stresses the need for full implementation of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1817(2008).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1817 (2008)</a> on international cooperation to prevent trafficking and diversion of chemical precursors of heroin for illicit use in Afghanistan."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2008-26.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2008/26</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
