	<div class="blockquote"><b>(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic and Social Council</b></div>
	<div class="p"><b>The President: </b>This morning the General Assembly will proceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic and Social Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 1999.</div>
	<div class="p">The 18 outgoing members are Cape Verde, Chile, Cuba, Djibouti, El Salvador, France, the Gambia, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, Mozambique, the Republic of Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Zambia.</div>
	<div class="p">As of 1 January 2000, the following States will continue to be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Algeria, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Colombia, the Comoros, the Czech Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Italy, Lesotho, Mauritius, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, the Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America, Venezuela and Viet Nam. The names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.</div>
	<div class="p">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account the number of States which will remain members of the Council after 1 January 2000, the 18 members should be elected as follows: five from African States, three from Asian States, one from Eastern European States, four from Latin American and Caribbean States, and five from Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to inform the Assembly that those candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</div>
	<div class="p">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to this procedure?</div>

	<div class="p">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.</div>
	<div class="p">Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by the Chairmen of the regional groups that for the five vacant seats from among the African States, the five endorsed candidates are Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and the Sudan.</div>
	<div class="p">For the three vacant seats from among the Asian States, there are six candidates, namely, Bahrain, Fiji, Japan, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.</div>

	<div class="p">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.</div>
	<div class="p">I should like to seek the usual cooperation of representatives during the time of the conduct of the election. As you are all aware, once the voting begins, all campaigning should cease on the main floor of the General Assembly Hall. This means in particular that until the election is completed, no more campaign material can be distributed inside the Hall. This includes the recess time when the results are being tallied.</div>
	<div class="p">Ballot papers marked "A", "B", "C", "D" and "E" will now be distributed. I request representatives to use only those ballot papers and to write on them the names of the States for which they wish to vote.</div>
	<div class="p">A ballot paper containing more names from the relevant region than the number of seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a ballot paper which do not belong to that region will not be counted at all.</div>
