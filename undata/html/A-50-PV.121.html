	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa01">On behalf of the Government and the people of Bangladesh, I wish to thank you most profoundly, Sir, for your kind words of sympathy and condolence at the recent flood in Bangladesh. I also take this opportunity to express gratitude to the Secretary-General for his appeal to Member States to offer aid and assistance to alleviate the suffering of our distressed people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Flood waters in five northern districts of Bangladesh have inundated large areas. They have destroyed food and cash crops across more than 50,000 acres. At least 12 people have tragically drowned; thousands of people have become homeless; and more than 1 million have been affected in one way or another.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The situation is still worsening. New areas are being inundated, as the water level of the two major rivers, the Brahmaputra and the Ganges, rises. As a consequence, the need for shelters, medical assistance and relief for the people is increasing. Once the present flood situation is over, the task of rehabilitating the destitute will be put in full swing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">At present, the Government of Bangladesh and concerned national agencies have been striving hard to mobilize adequate manpower and resources to mitigate the suffering of the affected people. People are working around the clock without rest or respite to provide succour and assistance to the flood victims.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa05">I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Government of Bangladesh has so far had the good fortune of being able to control the present situation by itself. The resilience of our people has enabled the Government to deal with the grim situation more easily than expected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa06">On behalf of the people and the Government of Bangladesh I wish to express our deepest gratitude to you, Sir, to the Secretary-General, and to all States Members of the United Nations for rallying round Bangladesh in offering generous support at this very difficult hour.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, you have just expressed sympathy to China for the floods that have taken place. The Chinese delegation is very much moved by your comments and, on behalf of the Chinese Government, we would like to express our gratitude to you. We believe that your words will provide great support to our flood-stricken people, and will encourage them to overcome the problems caused by the flooding and rebuild their homes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">Some eleven provinces in China have recently been flooded, of which four have had serious problems. Recent statistics show that about 400 people have lost their lives, and hundreds of thousands of people have left their homes. The costs exceed 10 billion renminbi, or more than $1.2 billion. The Chinese Government is trying to mobilize our people to overcome the problems caused by the flood. The Members of the United Nations have extended their sympathy to China, and some countries have already offered assistance. I would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Member States who have given their support.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa01">It was very kind and thoughtful of you, Sir, to refer to the disaster which recently struck our country. The heavy rains and flooding which have occurred over the past few months represent a severe blow to our economy and a threat to the health and safety of our citizens. Not only have crops and livestock been destroyed, but there is also the very real danger of an outbreak of disease. A state of national emergency has been declared.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa02">The Government is doing all in its power to cope with the situation, and we are grateful for the prompt intervention of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the United Nations Development Programme, and all others who have provided much-needed relief. We would, however, welcome the continued generous assistance of the international community, since conditions are likely to worsen in the days ahead.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk03-pa03">Again, I thank the Assembly for its expression of sympathy and support. At the same time my delegation extends its condolences to other sister States -- Bangladesh, China and Yemen -- which have suffered similar misfortunes.</div>

I would also like to thank the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the United Nations Development Programme and all the humanitarian organizations and friendly and brotherly Governments for their backing and support of the people of Yemen. They have made efforts to come to the aid of the Yemeni people at this difficult time, and to bring emergency assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa02">According to Department of Humanitarian Affairs Situation Report number 6 of 4 July, the damage has dealt a severe blow to Yemen's economy and constitutes a humanitarian disaster. The figures cited in that report provide evidence of this: 124,000 people have been affected; 324 people have been killed; 108 are missing; and more than 3,770 families have been forced to leave their homes. Crops have been destroyed and 13,000 head of livestock are missing. More than 37,000 fruit trees, 1,335 other trees, 34 generators, over 1,000 pumps, 1,068 kilometres of road surface and 38 schools have been destroyed. According to Yemeni authorities, these are only preliminary estimates of the damage. Further damage may yet come to light.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa03">We thank the organizations and Governments that are helping Yemen, in this hour of need, to rebuild everything that was destroyed by the torrential rains and floods in order to reconstruct our infrastructure.</div>

I urge us all to place at the forefront of our thoughts and actions the principles and ideals which the <i>ekecheria </i>and the Olympic Movement seek to propagate.

This item has always been of interest to my delegation; that interest is the expression of the value we place on sport as an activity that has redeeming virtues in a world beset by the problems and ills well known to us all: drugs, violence, terrorism, crime, nihilism and despair, which go hand in hand with hunger, unemployment, oppression and lack of opportunity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa02">On behalf of my Government, I reiterate that interest, and at the same time I express Panama's support and recognition for the solemn appeal made by the President of the General Assembly concerning the observance of the Olympic Truce. The decision to place on record our support and recognition is based on the fact that the games of the XXVI Olympiad will be taking place soon in Atlanta, from 19 July to 4 August 1996 -- that is, in the next few days.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk01-pa03">My delegation wishes to reiterate its hope that the games of the XXVI Olympiad will not merely unfold, but will also have a significance that will mark the history of the late twentieth century with values and emotions that can help humanity to achieve high scores in truth, tolerance, sympathy, freedom, serenity and democracy.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk08-pa01"> I should like to make an announcement concerning the Informal Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Peace.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk08-pa02">Members will recall that at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly, an Informal Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Peace was established and the President of the Assembly designated the Permanent Representative of Spain, His Excellency Mr. Juan Antonio Yáñez-Barnuevo, its Vice-Chairman. Members will further recall that the Informal Open-ended Working Group was reconvened during the forty-ninth session and that the President of the Assembly again designated Ambassador Yáñez-Barnuevo Vice-Chairman of the Group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk08-pa03">Since Ambassador Yáñez-Barnuevo has now returned to his country, he will no longer be available to serve as Vice-Chairman of the working group.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk08-pa04">In this regard, following the necessary consultations, I am designating the Permanent Representative of Norway, His Excellency Mr. Hans Jacob Biørn Lian, to assume the vice-chairmanship of the Informal Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Peace. I should like to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the Assembly, Ambassador Yáñez-Barnuevo for the invaluable contribution he has provided to this very important working group.</div>
