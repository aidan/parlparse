<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sharma</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">It is indeed a great pleasure to participate, under your chairmanship, Sir, in this open periodical debate on the progress of the mandate given to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). My previous statement before the Council was made six months after the accession to independent statehood of Timor-Leste and the current report covers almost a year since independence. My statement today is being made shortly before the Council will deliberate the adoption of a draft resolution extending the mandate of UNMISET for a final year.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">With the passage of time, the experience of any newly independent nation exhibits features in the continuum of national experience, with emerging potentialities. In respect of the evolving situation over the first year of Timor-Leste, I wish to remark first of all on developments to which a re-evaluated response was required by the Council in the security-related mandate of UNMISET.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I would like to begin by expressing our appreciation for the Security Council's recognition of the pivotal requirement of international support for the stability of Timor-Leste, as reflected in its adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>. The strengthening of the police force through a recast strategy involving accretion of capacity and mobility, reinforced training and augmentation of professionalism according to the highest policing standards, on the one hand, and a more gradual drawdown of the peacekeeping forces, on the other, are of critical importance. They will be of enormous assistance as we seek to address the emergent threats identified in the Secretary-General's special report: the risk of civil disorder and the criminal and politically motivated violence in rural areas, which appears to be part of a strategy by the perpetrators to try to instigate numerous such incidents simultaneously across the entire territory of the country in order to encourage a perception of a crisis in governance and instil a fear of returning social disorder.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">A surge in violence at this time could potentially generate a demoralizing psychological apprehension in the population of a recrudescence of violence and of the rending of the social fabric still fresh in memory and experienced in the searing national turmoil only a few years ago. This factor of traumatic national experience will diminish in potency through the passage of time, but the initial years of the State are critical in firmly entrenching the confidence both of the Government and of the people that the political, administrative and security order in the State, on which all steady social and economic advance depends, cannot be shaken or challenged. The slower drawdown of the UNMISET military component would contribute to reducing the threat posed by such groups, while also ensuring that the police forces have adequate time to develop. The revised drawdown schedule is contained in the report of the Secretary-General before the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">UNMISET has noted the emphasis widely placed by members of the Council and other Member States on the institutional strengthening of the police and has initiated and supported actions by the Government of Timor-Leste in this direction, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other development partners. These efforts will build in particular on the foundation provided by the report of the joint assessment mission on policing requirements. The recommendations of the joint assessment mission will be reflected in the comprehensive road map under preparation for institutional strengthening and their implementation will be overseen by a committee on institutional strengthening of the police, chaired by the Minister of the Interior. This process was further supported by discussions during a major international workshop with the highest-level participation, which has just concluded.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">We have been mindful to learn the appropriate lessons from the civic riots in Dili, the instance of armed attacks in the district of Ermera and subsequent instances of armed banditry in other districts. These first instances of security threats to the State have provided additional impetus for recasting, planning and augmenting readiness to make such challenges difficult to mount in the future. That there will be other instances of attempted assaults on the fabric of law and order is a reasonable surmise. However, Timor-Leste is now on a path where it can be quick to respond effectively to such situations and work towards eventually dismantling such threats through appropriate security, political and economic measures, which would progressively show positive results.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The process of handing over policing functions to the National Police of Timor-Leste (PNTL) continues, with some adjustments, and responsibility for policing more than half of the districts in the country's territory is now in the hands of PNTL. We are strengthening our presence as advisors in all districts and headquarters to ensure a process of smooth transition until all responsibility is transferred by mid-2004. With the cluster of improvements initiated, it is expected that the State will be better equipped with the essential means necessary to ensure stability in the time to come, even though reviewing and enhancing security capacity and responsibility in the light of requirements is admittedly a continuing and evolving process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">In the development of beneficial external relations of Timor-Leste, the growing and constructive relationship between Timor-Leste and Indonesia has been a great asset. High-level visits have been exchanged that have given political direction and substance to the positively evolving relationship and the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste will be making his first official visit to Indonesia in early June. Through the forward-looking meeting of the Joint Commission, both countries have resolved upon cooperation in a variety of areas. Both countries are also striving to meet the target for delineation of the land border by 30 June, but it will require substantial effort on both sides to achieve that target date. Some financial and technical support is needed to complete the joint actions required by the deadline and eventually also for carrying out demarcation of the international boundary. The process of handing over border oversight and control services from the peacekeeping force to the Border Patrol Unit of the Timor-Leste Police has commenced.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">I wish to acknowledge here the encouragement which I have received through the reception accorded to me at the highest political levels in Jakarta. It continues to be our endeavour to play as helpful a role as we can to both sides in advancing the bilateral relationship in transitional matters, as we have been mandated to do, over the duration of UNMISET.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">Despite efforts deployed by both countries and the international community, around 30,000 refugees remain in West Timor. Voluntary resettlement in other parts of Indonesia continues to be the policy of Indonesia. The return of refugees to Timor-Leste has virtually ceased since last December after the announcement of the cessation clause by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), though a significant decline in returns had been perceptible even in October and November. It is encouraging to note that, while some former adherents of the militias have again been involved in criminal activities in Timor-Leste, the Government of Indonesia has stated its commitment to assist in neutralizing those elements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">The task of developing a professional, dedicated and responsive public administration from ground level is no less a challenge for the new State. The Council had mandated UNMISET to prepare the groundwork for the structure of a national administration over two years, and halfway through the process we can report that progress is satisfactory, given the scope of capacity-building support that could be provided, limited to providing international advisers to 100 stability posts. The uneven situation in respect of counterparts that could be provided, given the undeveloped skills inherited by Timorese society, has been another constraining feature.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">It is clear, however, that within the 15 sectors where we provide support, there are areas where the necessity of continued mentoring and online assistance will remain on account of the depth of expertise necessary, the extent and scope of practical and conceptual knowledge to be transferred and the critical nature of some crucial sectors. In the period following the departure of UNMISET, it has to be ensured that the functioning of those critical sectors is not jeopardized. We have initiated the process of identifying the areas where continuing supportiveness will be required, together with the reasons for it. That assessment will be shared with the Council and other partners so that appropriate successor arrangements may be taken in hand in good time.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The role of UNDP, which is crucial in advocating the need for further capacity-building support and filling, in parallel, more than 200 development posts, will continue to be central. UNMISET has been particular in keeping the civilian support programme under constant review, in close consultation with the Government, for lessons that are progressively learnt and improvements that can be effected.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">The Serious Crimes Unit was set up under the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) for the judicial handling of cases of egregious crimes surrounding the popular consultation of 1999. The Unit had to resolve many challenges in the start-up phase, and efforts need to be made continuously in facilitating the work of the Special Panels for Serious Crimes at the Dili District Court, which has been made responsible for trying those cases in the areas of investigation, prosecution, trial, defence and support services to the Court. Subsequent to the judgements, we must anticipate the appeals phase. The process, although slower than earlier envisaged when the constraints were not clear, is now under way.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">In respect to the 10 priority cases of crimes against humanity and the five cases of widespread patterns of serious violations of human rights, progress as of the end of April 2003 has been as follows: Investigations have been completed in nine out of the ten priority cases. Eight additional major cases of crimes against humanity have been fully investigated and indicted so far. Trials are proceeding in those cases where the accused are in Timor-Leste, and two cases -- Los Palos and Lolotae -- have been judged at the first instance. In many other cases the trials may not even commence due to the absence of defendants, a large proportion of whom remain outside of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">The role of UNMISET has been to provide substantive, administrative and technical support to the process so that the infrastructure required for the trials is available. In order to assist in the investigation and indictment phase, and in the subsequent trials, UNMISET has provided the Prosecutor General of Timor-Leste with an international Deputy Prosecutor General, who heads the Serious Crimes Unit composed of prosecutors and investigators. UNMISET has also provided the services of judges for the panels and public defenders for the trials. Along with areas, such as public administration and policing, which will continue to require support after UNMISET withdraws, the mandate to bring to justice the perpetrators of serious crimes committed in 1999 is another area which will require deliberation as to the appropriate post-UNMISET arrangement, as it is certain that the judicial process cannot be completed within the period of UNMISET's mandate, which is until mid-2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">The economic situation of Timor-Leste is slow to improve given the comprehensive legacy of underdevelopment inherited by the newly independent State. The path of development and fulfilment of economic and social needs will be long and arduous, and in the foreseeable future the country will have to manage the political and economic pressures created by depressed economic and social indicators and, in particular, joblessness. The indicators of poverty for Timor-Leste enumerated in the UNDP Human Development Report of 2002 include an infant mortality rate of 80 in every 1,000 live births; an adult literacy rate of 43 per cent -- with 46 per cent of the population having never attended school -- resulting in a large inexperienced and unskilled work force; more than two out of five people living on 55 cents a day or less; a life expectancy of only 57 years; and a per capita gross domestic product of less than $500, with a total gross domestic product of $380 million.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">The majority of the East Timorese people still practise subsistence agriculture, with extremely rudimentary means of production. The economy needs a focus on agriculture based on greater diversity and quantity of production, encouragement to small industries, creation of professional services and opportunities for self-employment as the basis of the Timorese economy. The Government recognizes that, as a small and not heavily populated country, Timor-Leste should enable greater participation of beneficiaries in the process of development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa19">Timor-Leste seeks self-sufficiency as an objective to be achieved in the medium term. The existence of the means for doing so is encouraging. In my last statement to the Council I stated the favourable conditions possessed by Timor-Leste in terms of its affluent and dynamic neighbourhood and its reserves of natural resources that could be turned to advantage for the country's economic upturn.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa20">The ratification, after a protracted process, of the Timor Sea Treaty between Timor-Leste and Australia, enabling the exploitation of an offshore oil and gas field, has been an important development for the public finances of Timor-Leste. Prospects for further revenues will be enhanced through cooperation between the two countries on another identified field. In respect of the five metallic ores and three types of industrial clays that have been surveyed and that are believed to exist in commercial quantities, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has prepared a comprehensive report, which was presented to the Government by the ESCAP Executive Secretary earlier in the year. The fisheries and tourism potential also remains to be exploited. The Government is aware that in order to attract investor interest the basic laws and guidelines required have to be put in place quickly. Timor-Leste has also formally applied for recognition as a least developed country. Concessions granted to such countries by other countries could potentially attract some investors.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa21">Development strategies towards fulfilment of the goals in the comprehensive National Development Plan are being pursued with the participation of bilateral partners and institutions. The national exercise of identifying policy priorities on the basis of popular consultation has evinced close compatibility with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The Government is committed to registering advances in key social indicators. A signal contribution is being made in assisting the development process by UNDP and the United Nations agencies, and that relationship will, of course, continue after UNMISET's departure in mid-2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa22">The role being played by other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes is truly commendable and will contribute to a smooth transition to a traditional development assistance framework after the completion of UNMISET's mandate. The decision to appoint the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General as Resident Representative of the UNDP and Resident Coordinator of United Nations agencies has demonstrated its value in practice, and I should like to acknowledge here the important contribution made by the Deputy Special Representative, Mr. Sukehiro Hasegawa. UNMISET itself has encouraged initiatives through the creation of a science park and science education in cooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, through business promotion and the development of small enterprises in cooperation with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and through focused pilot projects of direct economic and social benefit in identified rural areas with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. I also wish to acknowledge their support and responsiveness.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa23">The Council can take satisfaction in the contribution its decisions have made to consolidating and buttressing the new nation of Timor-Leste, now a Member of the United Nations. The Council has before it the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>), which provides information on the current situation in some detail. Experience shows that nation-building is the result of unremitting effort and belief in political values that a country's leadership and citizens can bring to bear to the task; partners can play only a supportive role. The United Nations has played that role well. The Council must, in due course, take a view on the optimal form that the Organization's association with Timor-Leste should take after UNMISET has concluded, in the context of intrinsic requirements. The engagement of the international community in peace-building and institution-building will need to continue. As UNMISET downsizes in preparation for its ultimate withdrawal, we will be reviewing possible options through which those continuing needs can be met.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa24">Timor-Leste should proceed on its chosen path with faith and persistence, reflecting the central importance of an ethos of governance based on the rule of law -- the judiciary must move swiftly to win public confidence -- personal freedoms and universal principles of human rights. The United Nations will continue to be an ally on that journey.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Sharma for the information that he shared with the Security Council this afternoon, and I thank the Secretary-General for his report.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to Council members. In doing so, I should like to recommend that statements be limited to five minutes so that we can hold this afternoon's meeting within the planned time frame as easily as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Menédez</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">I thank Mr. Sharma for presenting the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The progress made by Timor-Leste with the support of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) during its first year is immense and encouraging. The foundations have been laid for the development of a State that is democratic, independent, respectful of human rights and integrated into the region and that maintains good relations with Indonesia. However, a long road remains ahead, and the international community's assistance continues to be essential.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Timor-Leste's public institutions must be strengthened, and a culture of responsible management must be developed. The administration, including the judicial authority, must consist of apolitical and professional officials, chosen in a transparent way on the basis of their merits. The UNMISET Civilian Support Group has a fundamental role.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Spain welcomes the commitment of the Government of Timor-Leste to human rights, which has taken shape in the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court and other fundamental international treaties in that area. In addition, we salute the establishment of the Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice, and we hope that it will begin to function as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">The continued progress in bilateral relations with Indonesia is very encouraging. Both States, with international help, must make all the necessary efforts to comply with their commitment to reaching an agreement on border demarcation before 30 June, as well as to establishing a flexible border regime and facilitating communications for the residents of the Oecussi enclave.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">As the Secretary-General points out in his report, relations between Indonesia and Timor-Leste will improve over the long term with the prosecution in both countries of those charged with having committed serious crimes in 1999. In that connection, we acknowledge the important step taken by Indonesia in bringing the perpetrators of those violations before the ad hoc Human Rights Tribunal. However, we are disappointed at the way in which the trials are proceeding. Therefore, we urge the Indonesian Government to improve those judicial processes in a transparent way in order to ensure that justice is done. At the same time, the reconciliation process in Timor-Leste must be completed. The Serious Crimes Unit and the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation, both assisted by UNMISET, have fundamental roles to play.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">Furthermore, we hope that the treaties recently signed with Australia on energy and maritime resources help to foster the much-needed economic development of Timor-Leste. Through the European Union and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), we shall continue to support programmes aimed at, inter alia, reducing poverty and rehabilitating basic infrastructures. In addition, Spain has included Timor-Leste in its international cooperation plan, within the framework of assistance provided to non-governmental organizations that carry out development assistance plans in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, which we recently adopted unanimously, envisages an adjustment of UNMISET's police and military components. The National Police of Timor-Leste must prepare itself to meet its new challenges with professionalism, responsibility and effectiveness. With regard to the military component, we support the revised strategy proposed by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, I wish to express my country's support for the renewal of UNMISET's mandate for one more year, until May 2004, so that it can successfully complete work that has gone well thus far.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdés</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">First of all, Sir, allow me to congratulate you on the excellent way in which you have conducted our work during this month. I would like to express the gratitude of the delegation of Chile for having convened this meeting to consider the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>), dated 21 April, on the situation in Timor-Leste. We would also like to thank our friend, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Last March the Security Council held a public meeting to comment on the Secretary-General's special report, which mentioned serious civil disturbances and subsequent acts of violence that affected the security situation in that country. On that occasion, adjustments were proposed to downsize the presence of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), and they were supported by the Council members through the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, of 4 April. The resolution supports the proposal for the adjustment of the downsizing of the police component, welcomes a revised schedule for the downsizing of the military component and calls for a detailed military strategy for the revised schedule.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">We also share the view concerning the specific security situation, and that the solution of those immediate problems must be seen within a broad framework in a long-term process that would make it possible to fully establish a viable, independent State.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">We now acknowledge UNMISET's dedicated efforts in complying with its mandate in Timor-Leste. In particular, we note the work done by the Civilian Support Group, which has trained public servants and has broadly supported the administration of this new country. In this context, we urge them to continue working on developing a strategic plan to identify the areas that will require bilateral support. We also value the work that has made it possible for the National Police of Timor-Leste to have 2,530 officers present in 6 of the country's 13 districts. However, we understand that the National Police must continue its preparation in order to take up more difficult threats to security, especially with respect to civil disturbances and the handling of the resurgence of armed groups.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">We reiterate that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a> is a great contribution in terms of training for the police, especially when it comes to human rights, the rule of law, the development of rapid deployment groups and the maintenance of a greater presence in the districts. There is no doubt that all this will lead to greater professionalism, effectiveness and responsibility for the police force in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Likewise, after reviewing the military strategies set out in the report, we feel that they are relevant and realistic and will make it possible to achieve concrete progress within the framework of the country's security. In this context, we urge UNMISET to continue to firmly support Falintil-FDTL in order to help it overcome its current limitations -- that is, its reduced numbers, the lack of presence in the western sectors of the territory and the need to improve its mobility by air and by land, among others.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">We greatly value the assistance provided by UNMISET in the area of human rights. We also value the assistance given through the Serious Crimes Unit in seeking to clear up the crimes committed in 1999. That has led to the submission of 60 charges against 247 people. However, we know that the development of this judicial process will require more external assistance in order to complete the process. In this respect, we would like to point out that it is indispensable that Indonesia's cooperation be improved in order to prosecute the accused. We urge the parties to continue working closely and in a true spirit of cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Our own experience as a country has taught us that only with truth and justice will it be possible to continue building together and to overcome the difficulties of the past. Likewise, we acknowledge the need to improve the operation of the judicial system in Timor-Leste, and we welcome the valuable contribution made by UNMISET in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">The integration efforts by the Government of Timor-Leste with the States in the region are very positive. We note its recent joining of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, as well as its admission into the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific last 30 April. We greatly appreciate the agreements on oil resources signed with Australia in March and the beginning of this month. This is particularly important, because we know that in order to achieve true stability Timor-Leste requires economic development, which will enable it to overcome poverty, generate jobs, improve the population's well-being and achieve greater socio-economic success.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">We share the view that, although very important progress has been made, the assistance of the international community is crucial in order to take up yet-unresolved complex problems. In this context, we agree that it is advisable to extend UNMISET's mandate for another year -- that is, until 20 May 2004. That mandate should be established with clear and specific tasks in order to ensure a proper and stable transition for the well-being of the people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">Lastly, we would like to express our gratitude to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Timor-Leste and to his team. We would also like to express our gratitude and appreciation for the efforts made by the Government of Timor-Leste, led by President Xanana Gusmão and the valuable support provided by countries of the region to this country, which is taking its first steps as an independent nation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diallo</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, allow me to thank Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Timor-Leste and head of mission, for introducing the report under consideration and for the useful information he has given us.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">My delegation, in agreeing to the establishment of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), had clearly pointed out that developments in the situation and experience in the field would be highly instructive for us regarding possible additional action by the international community. Consideration of the special report of the Secretary-General of 10 March allowed us to voice our concern regarding the difficulties and threats which continue to block security, stability and the development of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a> and the submission of the report under consideration thus are results of the Council's concern and willingness to take specific measures to avoid jeopardizing gains that have been achieved barely one year after independence.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">In considering the report before us, my delegation is still concerned about the difficulties linked to the strengthening of political, administrative, security and judicial institutions. However, we appreciate the efforts made by the authorities to ensure a broad diversity of views in political debate, as well as in the promotion of administration and justice in the service of all.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We are gratified by positive developments in the relationship between Timor-Leste and its neighbours, in particular Indonesia, and urge them to give pride of place to dialogue and cooperation for peace, security and the stability of the region. We encourage the authorities of Timor-Leste to pursue their initiatives at integration in international, regional and subregional organizations and institutions. Moreover, we hail the commendable contribution of the United Nations to carrying out the objectives set down in the plan for the implementation of UNMISET's mandate, and we appreciate consultations that have taken place with the Government, the population of Timor-Leste and the donors to work for the implementation of these goals.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We are encouraged by the fact that the strategic plan described in paragraph 16 of the report is being elaborated; we hope that it will make it possible effectively to facilitate the progressive replacement of civil advisers with nationals.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">My delegation notes that implementation of Programme I, on stability, democracy and justice, continues to be hampered by several factors the resolution of which requires bilateral and multilateral assistance. We support the creation of the Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice and proposals aimed at strengthening justice.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">In addition, we believe that Programme II, on internal security and law enforcement, requires more thorough training of the National Police of Timor-Leste (PNTL) to enable it better to shoulder the various responsibilities assigned to it. We welcome the actions undertaken by the Government in cooperation with the United Nations and the donor community to strengthen the institutional capacity of the PNTL.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">My delegation welcomes the support that the military component of UNMISET is continuing to provide for the strengthening of the external security and the territorial integrity of Timor-Leste, under Programme III, on external security and border control. We share the observations and recommendations of the Secretary-General on this issue, in particular his assessment that international military capability will be essential in the coming months to promote security in the area of the Tactical Coordination Line and to provide a short-term response to the threats posed by armed groups.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">With respect to the role of the United Nations, my delegation deplores the slow pace of economic activity, which has been hindered mainly by the continued reduction of the international presence and by the still relatively unpredictable security situation. We encourage the continuation of actions by UNMISET, the agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations, the World Bank and Member States, in cooperation with civil society and the private sector, to strengthen economic activity.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">In order to meet the numerous challenges intrinsic to laying the foundations of a viable State in Timor-Leste, the commitment of the international community is completely indispensable in complementing the efforts made by the people of Timor-Leste themselves. We especially call on donors to support the fundamental sectors, including those of defence, police, administration and justice. That will undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of peace, security and stability, which are fundamental to a country's sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa12">My delegation hopes that the General Assembly will consider positively the revised draft budget of UNMISET for the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004, which will be submitted to the Assembly during its fifty-eighth session.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa13">My delegation supports the observations and recommendations made by the Secretary-General and the proposal to renew UNMISET's mandate for an additional year ending 20 May 2004 so that actions begun can be successfully completed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa14">In conclusion, my delegation would like to renew its full support for the efforts made by UNMISET, under the dynamic leadership of Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, for the strengthening of internal stability and the development of Timor-Leste.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his 21 April report on the situation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>) and thank his Special Representative for that country, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, whom I welcome here at the Council table. I thank him for his work at the head of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">After reading the Secretary-General's report, we are more convinced than ever that the Council must remain engaged in the situation in Timor-Leste. Bulgaria agrees with the report's conclusion that in adopting <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, the Council showed that it was determined to provide the support required for the long-term success of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">My delegation hopes that modifications to UNMISET's withdrawal strategy will ensure a more effective and more rapid training of the National Police of East Timor. However, we must point out that the stability and security of East Timor must be considered within a broader context. The establishment of an effective judicial system, the development of local legislation in accordance with international human rights standards, the judicial process for serious crimes committed in 1999, the establishment of a non-politicized administration and the reintegration into society of former combatants are among the necessary priorities enabling the strengthening of State institutions, stability and democratic development in the young country.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">Bulgaria fully appreciates the efforts of President Xanana Gusmão to promote a national dialogue and to set up commissions to identify former combatants and to integrate them into the society of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Bulgaria also welcomes the Government of Timor-Leste's ratification of six core international human rights treaties and four optional protocols. Bulgaria supports the appeal of the Secretary-General to States in whose territory are found individuals accused of committing serious crimes in Timor-Leste in 1999 to help bring those individuals to justice as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">We call upon the Governments of Indonesia and Timor-Leste to spare no efforts to support the work of the technical group for demarcation and regulation of the border, as bilateral relations between the two neighbouring countries are of great importance for the future of the young State of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">The bilateral and multilateral support of the international community is, of course, crucial to the economic and social development of Timor-Leste. Mr. Sharma has spoken in an interesting way of the economic prospects for Timor-Leste and of the importance of the continued commitment of the international community. UNMISET and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have an important role to play in developing a strategic plan outlining the areas in which bilateral assistance is essential. As I said earlier, Bulgaria is currently preparing a programme to assist the nascent armed forces of Timor-Leste with military equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">To conclude, I would like to say that my delegation supports the Secretary-General's recommendation that the mandate of UNMISET be renewed. I call the attention of Council members to the importance of continued commitment from the international community and the donor community to this young country with a nascent democracy.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Belinga-Eboutou</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Cameroon would like to thank and congratulate the Secretary-General for his report of 21 April 2003 on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">My delegation welcomes the presence among us of Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma and is grateful for the clear, concise and thorough briefing that he has given the Council on the situation in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">We are closely following the developments taking place in that young State, which despite some setbacks -- some of which were serious -- remains an example of success for United Nations action in the areas of peacekeeping, security and post-conflict management. It is gratifying to note that, after the events that took place in Dili and the Ermera District in December and January 2002, which gave us cause to fear the worst, the situation has returned to normality.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">Given the events described in the report before us, political and administrative problems, internal and external security and the reconstruction and financing of the economy are all issues that require the vigilance, commitment and support of the United Nations and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">By declaring 2003 as the Year of Administrative Restructuring and Justice, the Government of Timor-Leste has clearly charted the course the followed. The strengthening of human and institutional capacity, particularly in the area of administration and justice, is the most urgent challenge facing the Timorese authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Minister Ramos-Horta was fully justified last week in deploring the chronic lack of resources for financing employment and essential public services. He forcefully emphasized that unemployment and a weak administrative and judicial infrastructure were at the root of the main problems currently faced by Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">It is clear that the sharp decline in the civilian component of UNMISET has further highlighted the institutional and personnel needs of the country. The Government's recruitment and training campaign must therefore be encouraged. In this regard the Administration should be called on to demonstrate its transparency and objectivity with a view to ensuring that it retains the apolitical character that is so necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">The lack of resources and the weakness of the judicial structure, which is very inadequately staffed -- inadequate in terms of quantity and quality -- are cause for real concern in a country in which the citizens need to be reassured on issues of justice. The report states that that drastic lack of personnel has been reflected in delays in the administration of justice, prolonged periods of pre-trial detention and prison overcrowding, with all the problems that they involve.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">I would like to echo the concerns expressed by human rights organizations with regard to the management of the file of serious crimes perpetrated in 1999, in both Timor-Leste and Indonesia. It is imperative that both countries strengthen their cooperation on this issue with a view to resolving it, as it is of great importance for the citizens of Timor-Leste as well as for the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">The Special Representative and head of UNMISET, and his office in Jakarta, should make further efforts in particular to induce Indonesia to send more positive signals in two important areas: the extradition to Timor-Leste of persons against whom there are charges, and the expansion, at the national level, of the field of action of the relevant ad hoc tribunal. Furthermore, the Security Council should begin to give some thought to how to ensure follow-up of this very important issue when UNMISET's mandate ends next year.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">With regard to internal and external security, my country reiterates its support for the approach of UNMISET and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations enshrined by the Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa12">We therefore subscribe to all of the report's proposals in this area, and we would like in particular to encourage the Government of Timor-Leste to continue to cooperate with Indonesia with a view to better discharging its new security responsibilities in the area of the Tactical Coordination Line.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa13">The political and institutional stability of Timor-Leste will depend upon the rapid economic and social development of the country. Combating poverty must therefore be the highest priority, not only for the Government of Timor-Leste but for the United Nations and the international community. To that end, the so-called Transition Support Programme should be better supported by the donor community.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa14">Certain recent developments are cause for optimism. One such is the ratification of the Timor Sea Treaty, which opens the way for the exploitation of gas and oil, guaranteeing significant revenue for Timor-Leste, which should serve as an impetus for economic growth. This is also true of the implementation, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme, of the Recovery, Employment and Stability Programme for Ex-Combatants and Communities in Timor-Leste (RESPECT), which is designed to ensure the reintegration of former combatants, as well as to provide assistance for vulnerable segments of the population.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa15">While the real political, economic and social difficulties facing this young democracy cannot be hidden, there are good reasons for optimism regarding its future, as long as the United Nations, the financial institutions and bilateral partners continue to step up their support for the country. Cameroon therefore endorses the recommendation of the Secretary-General that the mandate of UNMISET be renewed for one year.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa16">I should like in conclusion to express my country's appreciation for all the elements of UNMISET and to the head of the Mission, Ambassador Sharma, for the outstanding work that they, together with the young Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, have accomplished since 20 May 2002. They have been able to mobilize their many relationships and contacts in the international economic and financial field in the service of the people of that country.</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to thank the Secretary-General for his report, as well as Ambassador Sharma, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The general situation in East Timor is encouraging. Under the leadership of the Government of Timor-Leste, and with the active support of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), the people of Timor-Leste have, since independence, been pursuing the task of nation-building in all its aspects in a steady and orderly manner. The administrative and judicial systems are gradually moving towards institutionalization. The national defence force and the National Police have been intensifying their preparations for fulfilling their responsibilities for defending national peace and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Timor-Leste is integrating itself into the international community. It has continued to develop its relations with Indonesia and other countries in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">We are pleased to see what has been achieved by the Timorese Government and people. However, given the situation in the country, we cannot let our guard down. Not long ago, following a series of armed and violent incidents, the security situation deteriorated, giving rise to concern on the part of the international community and of the Security Council. For that reason, the Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a> and adjusted UNMISET's downsizing plan.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">As the Secretary-General pointed out in paragraph 64 of his report,</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">"By adopting <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, the Security Council showed that it remains determined to provide the support required for the long-term success of Timor-Leste."</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">We have noted the considerable efforts deployed by UNMISET in helping Timor-Leste to enhance its public administration capacities and to finalize the establishment of its judicial system. It has made progress in dealing with the threat posed by armed groups and has gradually created conditions for the national defence force and National Police to take over fully defence and policing matters.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">The Chinese delegation commends UNMISET and Ambassador Sharma for their achievements in helping the Government to carry out its work. We endorse the Secretary-General's recommendation, contained in his report, to extend UNMISET's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">Timor-Leste continues to confront various difficulties and challenges in its endeavours to ensure national security and stability and in promoting economic and social development. We endorse the Secretary-General's observation that nation-building efforts in Timor-Leste will require the assistance of the international community, in particular the donor countries, the United Nations system and international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">China will, as always, lend its strong support to the Timorese people in their efforts to maintain national stability and to build their country, and will continue to support the work of Ambassador Sharma and of UNMISET. China will continue to provide assistance to the extent of its capabilities.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gaspar Martins</span> <span class="nation">Angola</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, I would like at the outset to thank you for convening this meeting on the situation in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>), as well as the briefing presented to us this afternoon by our good friend Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma. I should like to reiterate our full confidence in the outstanding work he is doing; I am sure that this is what Timor-Leste and its people deserve.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">We welcome the significant progress achieved in several areas as regards the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1473 (2003)</a>. I wish to join previous speakers in expressing appreciation for the positive changes that have taken place, particularly in the field of security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">We are particularly pleased at the progress made in the field of public administration, in the functioning of Timor-Leste's justice system, in the conduct of investigations of serious crimes and in the role of the National Police. We wish to express our appreciation for the crucial role played by the advisers in the UNMISET Civilian Support Group in transferring knowledge and skills to Timor-Leste counterparts, which are important in providing support for the process of achieving stability in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">We would like to underline the continuing efforts of the Timorese Government to improve the situation with regard to peace and stability in the country by engaging in a broad political debate throughout all sectors of Timorese society. The communities themselves have a critical responsibility in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, adopted by the Security Council on 4 April 2003, requests the Secretary-General to provide a detailed military strategy for the revised schedule for the downsizing of the military component of UNMISET. My delegation takes note of the specific measures for the adjustment strategy proposed by the Secretary-General in his report. We believe that such a strategy provides an appropriate baseline for the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1473 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">We support the continuing efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, namely in the following areas: the provision of additional training capacities in key areas such as public administration and justice; the strengthening of human rights and the rule of law; and a monitoring and advisory presence in districts where policing authority has been handed over to the Timor-Leste Police Force.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">It is important that UNMISET, in order to deal with the limitations of Timor-Leste's police capabilities, address the recent security incidents, which made clear the fact that law enforcement will continue to be a real challenge for the country which will require vigorous and sustained efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">My delegation supports the extension of UNMISET's mandate for a further year, until 20 May 2004, and, in this context, we deem extremely important the additional commitment that the international community needs to make towards Timor-Leste. This is vital if we want to safeguard the great political and human investment made so far in this country in the context of this peace process, which we can consider a joint success story for the people of Timor-Leste and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">We join the appeal by the Secretary-General for bilateral support to supplement the efforts of UNMISETin order to guarantee a sustainable and efficient administration and a viable economy. The relevant agencies of the United Nations must therefore closely coordinate their efforts with those of the international community of donors in order to consolidate peace in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, we welcome the increasing cooperation between the authorities of Timor-Leste and of Indonesia. This spirit of cooperation between both countries was demonstrated by the discussions on border demarcation and in investigations of serious crimes. We encourage Timor-Leste and Indonesia to develop friendly and neighbourly relations, in order to strengthen security in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa12">Finally, we reiterate our confidence and friendship to the Government and to the fraternal people of Timor-Leste.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mekdad</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to thank the Secretary-General most sincerely for having submitted his report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET).</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We welcome Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNMISET. We thank him for having introduced and exhaustively summarized the report. We also welcome the Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">The essential role of the international community in ensuring independence and peace in Timor-Leste makes the Security Council's responsibility a dual and particularly onerous one. The efforts to consolidate Timor-Leste's independence demonstrate that those made to ensure security, development and progress there, despite all the obstacles, are indeed succeeding.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">The Secretary-General's report of 3 March highlighted those obstacles, in particular a series of incidents affecting security that were most alarming and which led to adjustments to the downsizing plan for UNMISET to allow the Mission to accomplish its mandated tasks within this changed environment. The Security Council assumed its responsibilities in unanimously adopting <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, by which it established measures to adjust the downsizing of the Mission's police component and supported a revised schedule for the downsizing of the military component. In so doing, the Council showed its resolve to continue to provide all necessary assistance for the success and long-term development of Timor-Leste. My delegation therefore supports the Secretary-General's recommendation that the mandate of UNMISET be extended for a further year, until 20 May 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">The developments in the political situation in Timor-Leste, as described in the report, reflect developments at all levels, in particular those in its relationship with Indonesia, which is based on the political commitment of the two parties. It deserves our support and admiration. We hope that these positive developments will continue, leading to the settlement of all outstanding issues between the two parties.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">Finally, I should like to reiterate the importance of providing the financial resources necessary to ensure the economic and political development of Timor-Leste. Such resources will be based on the generosity of the donors. We believe that the country status report on the Millennium Development Goals that Timor-Leste is to submit to the United Nations during its celebration of independence in May will allow the international community and the donor community to continue to help that country consolidate progress and development.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">The report is encouraging. It takes note of progress achieved by the Timor-Leste authorities in their gradual assumption of police and military competencies. It also emphasizes the positive developments in Timor-Leste's political institutions and context, as well as the noticeable improvement in its relations with Indonesia. This is clearly to be welcomed. My delegation hopes that the United Nations will continue to support the efforts of those two countries to stabilize their relationship, inter alia, in cooperating on investigations into the crimes perpetrated in 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">The remaining challenges, however, are numerous. The strengthening of the capacities of the police, as emphasized by Ambassador Sharma, is a priority for the future, as it will determine the enduring stability of Timor-Leste. The training of security groups in villages seems in this respect to be an interesting initiative. The police and the army will, inter alia, have to learn to work together. Finally, the judicial sector remains insufficiently developed, thus hampering the administration of justice.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">Regarding the Secretary-General's recommendations, my delegation supports the military strategy and the schedule for a reasonable downsizing of troops presented in the report, as well as an extension of the mandate of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for a further year.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">The report provides clarifications regarding the geographical deployment of police and military personnel. I should like to ask the Special Representative, however, for further clarifications with respect to the specific division of competencies in internal security. I would ask him in particular to define the conditions for the Government of Timor-Leste's conscription for its peacekeeping force in the maintenance of order.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">In conclusion, I wish to look to the future. The agreed timetable provides for a withdrawal of UNMISET in May 2004. As we approach that date, the issue of the modalities of the international community's involvement beyond the Mission's mandate will impose itself with increasing urgency. If we wish to ensure Timor-Leste's development, it is obvious that bilateral and multilateral donors, as well as the actors of the United Nations system, will have to remain present in some form or another and work together. As the Secretary-General says in his report, reflection on this subject is already under way. That seems to us to be both useful and necessary in better coordinating the efforts of all those playing a role in the field.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khalid</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I wish to welcome Ambassador Sharma to the Council and thank him for his comprehensive briefing on the situation in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">While we are happy to note significant progress made by Timor-Leste in certain key areas, we should also remain mindful of the serious challenges involved. This year did not begin very auspiciously for Timor-Leste, marred as it was by a series of disturbances. However, we are glad to note that the situation has improved since then. The internal security situation, as the Secretary-General's report indicates, is but one of many problems which that newly independent country currently faces.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">In our view, the biggest challenge before Timor-Leste is its economic future. The Secretary-General's report points out that "Timor-Leste remains the poorest country in South-east Asia" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>, para. 52</i>). It therefore needs continued and sustained assistance from the international community to promote economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">Pakistan welcomes the signing of the Timor Sea Treaty and the International Unitisation Agreement on the Greater Sunrise field, which will allow Timor-Leste to take advantage of significant oil and gas revenues. We also welcome Timor-Leste's admission, last Friday, to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific as another step in the right direction. Nevertheless, much more help is needed immediately to allow this country, at least economically, to stand on its own feet.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">International assistance is required also in the area of security. We are concerned to learn, through the Secretary-General's report, that to date Timor-Leste has not been able to make further enhancements to defence and security through bilateral arrangements. Similarly, the report also mentions shortfalls and resource constraints on matters relating to the internal security and justice sectors. The international community must step in to fill the gap.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">The Security Council took the correct decision earlier this month when it unanimously adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>. Through that resolution, the drawdown of UNMISET was frozen and the necessary adjustments to its composition were made. That enabled UNMISET to appropriately address the internal security challenges prevailing at the time as well as to build the capacity of the National Police of Timor-Leste to effectively respond to such situations. We hope the Council can maintain this kind of political flexibility and operational decisiveness in the future. Needless to say, Pakistan fully supports the extension of the mandate of UNMISET for another 12-month period. As Pakistan has often repeated, there must be no exit in any peacekeeping mission without completing the task.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Pakistan believes that the development of close and friendly relations between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is of utmost importance. Indeed, this is in the interest of both countries and the region as a whole. We welcome in this regard the commitment by the Government of Timor-Leste to work with the Indonesian authorities on various issues, especially border security and control matters. We call on both sides to work together to resolve any outstanding problems, including transitional justice issues, and to strengthen regional cooperation. Such cooperation can be an example for other regions as well.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">A lot has been achieved in Timor-Leste but still more work is required to consolidate the gains made thus far. The United Nations and the international community must continue to utilize all necessary means in that regard. Indeed, Timor-Leste is a success story for the United Nations for more than one reason. It is also an example of how the principle of self-determination was successfully implemented by the United Nations. There are other parts of the world, especially Jammu and Kashmir, that await the exercise of the right of self-determination promised to them by the Security Council.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Komizin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">We are grateful to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, for his briefing on the most recent events in Timor-Leste and also for his introduction of the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>), which objectively considers the work done by the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) during the reporting period in implementing its mandate, and which accurately describes the problems of the establishment of statehood for Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">We share concern regarding a certain exacerbation of the security situation in Timor-Leste. The serious civil disorder provoked by extremists in Dili last December and the recent stepping up of diversionary activities of armed groups and former militia members are extremely alarming. In this situation, UNMISET personnel and the Timor-Leste authorities must intensify their joint efforts to neutralize such threats. It is our hope that the revised programme and timetable approved by the Security Council for the drawdown of the police and military components of the Mission will enable the Mission, before the transfer of full responsibility for the maintenance of security to the national army and police, to more effectively provide conditions that would rule out destabilization of the young State and the undermining of its independence.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">Extremely important for the establishment of a viable, independent State is the establishment and the strengthening of a national army and the National Police of Timor-Leste. Here we welcome UNMISET's efforts to prepare and train the military and police forces of the country. We also welcome the expansion of the area of responsibility of the army and police forces now being formed in Timor-Leste. This is taking place according to schedule and without serious complications. We take note of the progress of the establishment of a Timor-Leste State administration. A good deal of credit must go to the UNMISET Civilian Support Group, as its staff members are undertaking significant efforts to share knowledge and experience with their Timorese colleagues and are giving effective assistance to the Government in ensuring the functioning of ministries and agencies.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Assistance for the social and economic development of Timor-Leste from multilateral and bilateral donors is vital for the long-term stability of the country. Here, the Russian Federation emphasizes the need for the intensified donor support for the Government of Timor-Leste in its efforts to achieve the fundamental objectives of the National Development Plan.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">We welcome the positive changes in the relationship between Timor-Leste and Indonesia, particularly regarding the important question of demarcation and regulation of the common border. The establishment and maintenance of good-neighbourly, mutually beneficial relations with neighbouring countries is a prerequisite for the successful establishment and development of the young State of Timor-Leste. We support the extension of the UNMISET mandate for one more year, until 20 May 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">In conclusion, we would like to wish the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, and all the personnel of UNMISET further success in implementing their mandate.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Williamson</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sharma, for his report. The United States is pleased that the predicted increase in violence in Timor-Leste has not materialized. We applaud the helpful role played by Indonesia. We encourage Timor-Leste and Indonesia to finalize their border by the targeted date.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">We strongly support the adjustments to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) approved by the Security Council, including strengthening the capacity of the Timor-Leste police force. The liquidation task force, under Special Representative Sharma, demonstrates good planning. We support the final 12-month extension for UNMISET.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I should like to join other delegations in thanking the Secretary-General for his latest report on the situation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>) and to thank Ambassador Sharma and his staff for the excellent work that they have done thus far. I should also like to pay tribute to the people of Timor-Leste and their representatives for their continuous successful endeavours as they build up their young democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">Germany appreciates the increased stabilization of the security environment in Timor-Leste. In that regard, we welcome the downsizing of the personnel of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, and the strengthening of the National Police, as well as the idea of a common border patrol between Indonesia and Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Planning a gradual transfer of policing authority to the Timor-Leste police force, as envisaged in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, remains one of our main targets in paving the way for a democratic Timor-Leste, independent of international assistance. Germany therefore welcomes the handing over of routine police tasks to the Timorese police as well as the enhancement of its capabilities to deal with crowd control and with the challenges potentially posed by armed groups. We encourage the parties to continue the process of smooth but steady transfer of responsibilities. The internationally formed police unit -- as envisaged by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a> -- will be used to address urgent needs alongside the competences already gained by the police of Timor-Leste so that the police force has adequate time to develop.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">We also support the actors involved in strengthening the country's political and administrative institutions in order to proceed with the establishment of a viable independent State. In that regard, we should like to point to the importance of an adequate judicial system, and we urge focus on that issue in order to guarantee free and fair trials and to promote the rule of law as an essential element of the new democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">Having listened attentively to the Special Representative, I believe that the major task clearly remains the country's economic and social development. Every possible effort is needed to achieve an upturn in the economy in order to promote the population's economic and social well-being -- an important prerequisite for the future political stability of the country. Here, the continued assistance of the international community remains essential.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">To accomplish these remaining tasks, we therefore fully agree with the Secretary-General's proposal to extend UNMISET's mandate for another year. We shall continue to promote further bilateral support alongside and after the Mission's contribution. The story of Timor-Leste is our common success story and therefore deserves our common support.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Thomson</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">Our thanks to Mr. Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and his team for all their work.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">Timor-Leste's international environment is important to its future, and the United Kingdom encourages Indonesia and Timor-Leste to continue working together towards agreement on border delineation by the 30 June 2003 deadline. That target has been described by Ambassador Sharma as "challenging".</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">The economic and social prospects of the country are also clearly crucial. Timor-Leste's economic future looks brighter with the ratification of the Timor Sea Treaty and its potential revenue streams. But no less important is the development of the quality of government in Timor-Leste itself.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">We salute the progress made so far by the Government of Timor-Leste, but I should like to focus my remarks on the justice and police and security sectors. We welcome the publication of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report on the justice sector. We see a pressing need to identify priorities for future UNDP assistance to the judicial system and to decide on next steps in preparation of the three- to five-year technical assistance programme. So we look forward to early finalization of the justice sector support programme, and we would welcome Special Representative Sharma's giving us an indication of its expected completion date.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">With regard to the police, we welcome Timorese ownership of the process of developing the country's police force and the role of Prime Minister Alkatiri and of other senior ministers at the police workshop this month. We hope that a resolution of all outstanding issues can be achieved at the next workshop, in June.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">We encourage full implementation of the recommendations in the joint assessment mission report, and we urge careful consideration of the sustainability of the Timorese rapid deployment group and of other specialist police groups, given the finite budget available.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">We support the Secretary-General's recommendation of increased cooperation between the Timorese police and defence forces, and we encourage the adoption of clear definitions of responsibility for both organizations. We believe that the formation of unofficial village-based security groups could seriously undermine, rather than help, the security situation. We urge that they be disbanded.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">The United Kingdom believes that there is now a need to focus UNMISET policing efforts on capacity-building in the Timorese police -- a point made by earlier speakers -- and we believe that donors must remain receptive to long-term support of the policing sector. My Government is ready to do its part in that respect.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">The United Kingdom supports the proposed revised military strategy and the extension of UNMISET's mandate for 12 months. It will be important for UNMISET to keep up the momentum so that the Mission may indeed conclude successfully in 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">Finally, the United Kingdom recognizes that, even after UNMISET has concluded its mandate, the international donor community will have to provide much support to Timor-Leste. The United Kingdom will play its part in that and urges other donors to do likewise. There must be no hiatus in the progress being made with the international community's support in Timor-Leste when UNMISET closes. So we very much agree with Special Representative Sharma that the Council must begin to think through with UNMISET the next stage in Timor-Leste's development so that the transition is smooth. We look forward to Ambassador Sharma's promised report and proposals to the Security Council on those issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I shall now take the floor in my capacity as representative of Mexico.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">My delegation wishes to thank Mr. Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, and the Secretary-General himself for the information provided to the Security Council and for the report before us (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>). The report relates the positive development of the situation in Timor-Leste but also reminds the international community and the Council that we must remain attentive to developments in the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">On 4 April, Mexico supported the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, which calls for an adjustment of the downsizing of the military and police components of UNMISET and reaffirms the Security Council's commitment to continue supporting security and stability efforts in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">United Nations reconstruction efforts in Timor-Leste provide us with valuable lessons and make it possible to draw conclusions and experiences that could be used in other situations requiring the building of a new State or support for rebuilding institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">As we have seen in the case of Timor-Leste, the international community's determination to support the building of a State is not sufficient if it is not accompanied by the necessary internal commitment on the part of all political forces and sectors of society. For this reason, the Government of Mexico welcomes the initiative undertaken on 25 January by President Gusmão to carry out a national dialogue with the various political forces in the country. We believe that it is only through dialogue and understanding that we can lay solid foundations for a true democratic and inclusive society in Timor-Leste. Likewise, friendly and good-neighbourly relations are paramount.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Globalization and interdependence mean that a country's development is closely linked to that of its neighbours. Thus, Mexico welcomes and supports the efforts made by Indonesia and by Australia to achieve border demarcation and regulation agreements, including commercial operations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">The Government of Mexico would like to express its gratitude to Mr. Sharma and to his team for the progress made thus far in discharging the mandate entrusted to them. This has led to the development of the ability of the Government and people of Timor-Leste to manage their own destiny. It is necessary to continue to work to remove shortcomings and to strengthen national capabilities. United Nations participation in this process is essential. The strategic plan that is being developed by the Government of Timor-Leste and by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is a step in that direction.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">Additional efforts will be required to strengthen the justice system. A greater number of trained judges and greater access to courts for the entire population are steps that could be taken to improve the situation in the immediate future. Reconciliation and peace depend to a large degree on a transparent and effective justice system.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">Timor-Leste also requires continual strengthening of its institutional processes. Thus, Mexico joins in the Secretary-General's appeal to the international donor community to continue supporting programmes for strengthening the National Police and the judicial system.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">As for internal security, the report reflects, as did <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, the importance of developing national capabilities and proper preparation for the defence forces and for the National Police. Mexico stresses the importance of training police in the area of human rights. In building a State, the population's confidence in law enforcement institutions is vital. The promulgation of a code of conduct for the police has thus been an important measure in that direction.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">As for external security and border control, proper coordination between the United Nations forces and the Governments of Timor-Leste and Indonesia is crucial. We urge both countries to continue strengthening their cooperation in those areas.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">On previous occasions, Mexico has referred to the importance of assisting with the economic and social development of Timor-Leste, as a fundamental element of peace-building. My country therefore views as highly positive the report's information on the work of United Nations agencies and programmes for infrastructure rehabilitation and national development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa13">With a view to reaffirming its commitment to Timor-Leste, Mexico supports the proposal of the Secretary-General to extend the UNMISET mandate for another year, until 20 May 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa14">On behalf of the Government and people of Mexico, I would like to join the others in expressing our gratitude to the civilian, military and police components of UNMISET, who have done excellent work in Timor-Leste. I would ask Ambassador Sharma to convey Mexico's greetings and its appreciation for the work that his team has carried out.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa15">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa16">The next speaker is the representative of Timor-Leste. I welcome him and give him the floor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guterres</span> <span class="nation">Timor-Leste</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">Sir, my Government congratulates you on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month. We thank you and the other members of the Council for convening this open meeting and for the opportunity to speak today.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">My delegation acknowledges the presence of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, whose leadership and advice have been invaluable at every level.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">Timor-Leste would like to commend the Secretary-General on his comprehensive report (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>) on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). We thank him for his continued commitment to ensuring that the intent and goals of the relevant Security Council resolutions are accomplished.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">Timor-Leste continues to appreciate the wisdom that Security Council members showed in having <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1410 (2002)</a> provide for a constant reassessment of security needs. Accordingly, we thank all members for their unanimous decision last month on <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, which adjusted the downsizing schedule.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">The violence of December of last year and the terrorist activities in the border area in January of this year created some fears about future security. However, the firm and transparent response by the United Nations and the Government of Timor-Leste has provided reassurance and has reasserted confidence and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">The mission of UNMISET has been and continues to be effective. Much progress has been made in the capacity-building of the Timorese police and military. In that regard, we would like to say at the outset that Timor-Leste fully endorses the Secretary-General's present recommendation that the mandate of UNMISET be extended for a further year, until 20 May 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">We continue to strive for responsible governance and the furtherance of democratic institutions and traditions of pluralism that are necessary for a secure and stable democracy. On 16 April 2003, Timor-Leste deposited with the Secretary-General its instruments of accession to seven multilateral treaties or protocols relating to human rights. Our Parliament has also ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons plus other treaties concerning weapons of mass destruction, the instruments of ratification of all of which will be deposited in the coming days.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">The recent appointment of the President of the Appeals Court by President Gusmão was a step forward in the strengthening of our justice sector. The Government is fully committed to building a robust and independent judiciary. However, this sector continues to require support from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">The work of the Serious Crimes Unit continues without any interference from other institutions. The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation continues its work and expects to complete its duties next year.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">The Government recognizes that a stable political and social environment cannot be sustained without addressing the basic needs of our people. In less than a year, the Government, with help from the international community, has had to address decisively many challenges in the sectors of human development, natural resources and the environment, infrastructure and private sector development, defence and security, and regional development and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">We have inherited a country with a per capita income of less than $400, an infant mortality rate of 80 to 145 per 1,000 live births, a maternal mortality rate of 400 to 800 per 100,000 live births, and a 20 per cent unemployment rate. It is a country in which 80 per cent of infrastructure was destroyed in September 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa12">While the development of human resources is a great investment for the medium and long terms, efforts are also being made in the areas of agriculture, fisheries and tourism. The majority of the Timorese live in rural areas.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa13">The agriculture sector represents approximately 21 per cent of the gross domestic product. It employs approximately 74 per cent of the labour force, but it has the lowest productivity rate in the region. The Ministry of Agriculture, with the help of various countries, has focused its attention on improving the irrigation system and providing help in reducing food insecurity, which affects 20 per cent of the rural population, and has taken the initial steps to create conditions for the transition from subsistence to export-and industry-oriented agriculture and fisheries.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa14">Timor-Leste shares the Secretary-General's appeal for full support from the international community. As his report has emphasized, the role of bilateral contributions and other assistance will continue to be of great importance. For example, Timor-Leste deems crucial the provision of the full number of 228 development advisers. It is critical that the pace of capacity-building be maintained.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa15">As noted in the report, Falintil-FDTL is indeed making steady progress. By the end of this year, two infantry battalions will be operational. But the provision of decent infrastructure to those battalions remains to be fully achieved, and further bilateral cooperation in those areas continues to be most welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa16">In addition to focusing on our internal development, we are committed to engagements with our neighbours and the international community. We hope that Timor-Leste will soon be admitted to the Association of South-East Asian Nations as an observer. Our relations with Indonesia and Australia are encouraging. We recently signed the Timor Sea Treaty with Australia, which will bring economic benefits to our people. Discussions on recognized international borders at sea and on land will continue. We have had significant progress with Indonesia, and we look forward to completing negotiations by 30 June of this year. We expect that the next official visit by Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri to Indonesia will bring new impetus to our cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa17">We will continue to establish diplomatic relations with countries of the United Nations family. We hope that our recent inclusion in the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will bring a new dynamism to economic cooperation. As our bilateral and multilateral relations continue to develop, we appeal to the donor community to remain engaged in furthering the building of our nascent democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa18">On 16 April 2003, Timor-Leste deposited with the Secretary-General ratifications of seven multilateral treaties and protocols relating to human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa19">We appreciate the prudence the Council has shown in dealing with the Timor-Leste situation, and we would like to say once again that Timor-Leste fully endorses the Secretary-General's recommendation that the mandate of UNMISET be extended for a further year, to 20 May 2004.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">I had hoped to make the shortest intervention this afternoon, but I am afraid that not even I can match the superb succinctness of the intervention of our American colleague. Nevertheless, Australia very much welcomes the Secretary-General's latest report on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>). We are delighted to have among us again today our friend and colleague Ambassador Sharma. We thank him and his team sincerely.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">The international community continues to hold high expectations of UNMISET. As the Secretary-General's report shows, significant progress has been made towards discharging the United Nations mandate in East Timor. But it is equally clear that a good deal of important work lies ahead. How the Mission achieves its remaining goals will go a long way to defining the success of the United Nations in the historic task of supporting East Timor's emergence as a nation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">The Secretary-General's report is highly timely. We have reached a critical stage in the life of the United Nations Mission and in the United Nations role in East Timor. Now more than ever, the United Nations needs to focus on what the Mission will leave behind in terms of solid and sustainable indigenous capacity in civil administration, law and justice and defence and security. We therefore strongly support the extension of the mandate for a further 12 months. That additional time will facilitate the Mission achieving its stated objectives and intent.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">In policing, a good deal of essential and basic foundational work remains to be done. We have had much discussion of this, but I think it requires further comment today. Australia is pleased that the Mission is redoubling its efforts to accelerate the development of East Timor's institutions of law enforcement. It is crucial that commitments made on paper are translated into solid and lasting progress on the ground. The Security Council's 4 April amendments to the UNMISET drawdown plan should help provide a secure backdrop for a renewed effort coordinated by the United Nations in this crucial area, and Australia stands ready to assist. A concerted effort in police force development from now until the end of the Mission will be essential to the ultimate success of the United Nations in East Timor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Santa Clara Gomes</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa01">Mr. President, allow me to begin by saying that it is a great pleasure to see you presiding over the Security Council. I thank you for convening this open meeting to examine the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>), covering its activities since the last report, dated 6 November 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa02">First, Portugal would like to extend its support to the important efforts of the United Nations in Timor-Leste under the already well-tested leadership of its Special Representative, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma. This is particularly noteworthy as political developments in Timor-Leste during the reporting period have been more complex than was initially foreseen.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa03">Last month, the Council had to consider a special report of the Secretary-General relating a change of environment in Timor-Leste as a result of a disturbing series of security-related incidents, some of them of a terrorist nature, which took place in the last months of 2002 and the early months of 2003. At the time, the Secretary-General asked the Council to reconsider the proposed downsizing plan for UNMISET, while keeping the envisioned handover date of May 2004. Consequently, the Council approved <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, which endorsed proposals for the adjustment of the downsizing of UNMISET's police component, supported a revised schedule for the downsizing of the Mission's military component and requested a detailed military strategy for the revised schedule.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa04">Portugal welcomes the most recent report of the Secretary-General, and it is pleased to note that, in spite of the problems to which I referred, much has been achieved in the year that has elapsed since the establishment of UNMISET and that the Timorese public administration and police force are assuming increasing levels of responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa05">Also to be highly commended is the steady and significant positive development in the relationship of Timor-Leste and its neighbour Indonesia, particularly regarding the determination of their joint border, as well as the progress on agreements between Australia and Timor-Leste concerning petroleum resources. One must not understate the importance that both a stable relationship with its neighbour States and prompt access to such natural resources have in paving the way for the solid and sustainable economic development of the newborn country.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa06">Portugal would also like to note UNMISET's efforts and the progress achieved with regard to the investigation and indictment of those responsible for crimes that took place in 1999. However, it is with concern that we note that the report expects the judicial process dealing with serious crimes still to be incomplete by June 2004 and that a strong political commitment is essential, as the majority of those accused remain outside Timor-Leste -- including nearly 90 per cent of those accused of crimes against humanity. We support the Secretary-General in urging the Governments of countries where those accused may be located to make every effort to ensure that such persons are brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa07">Finally, much remains to be done, and continued assistance by the international community will be crucial to enable Timor-Leste to face with success the serious political, practical and security challenges that lie ahead. Portugal will, as in the past, remain committed to the consolidation and development of Timor-Leste and to United Nations efforts to that effect.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa08">I am confident that the Security Council will not hesitate to extend the mandate of UNMISET for a further year, until 20 May 2004.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this open meeting. I also thank Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">The report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-449.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/449</a>) provides a detailed description of the situation in Timor-Leste a year after its independence. The Government of Japan is pleased to note that much has been achieved during the past year in the fields of public administration, internal security and Timor-Leste's relationship with Indonesia, including border-control issues. However, various political and security challenges remain to be overcome. We share the Secretary-General's observation that further bilateral assistance in such areas as public administration, the judiciary, the police and national security will be necessary even after UNMISET has concluded its activities.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">In this connection, recent incidents, such as riots and armed attacks, are a source of great concern for all of us. The Government of Japan welcomed <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, which was adopted to address this situation, and supports the revised strategies outlined in the report of the Secretary-General. It also supports the extension of UNMISET's mandate for one more year, until 20 May 2004, as recommended by the Secretary-General. The Japanese Government intends to take the necessary steps to enable its engineer group to continue contributing to the successful completion of the mandates of UNMISET, as well as to Timor-Leste's nation-building efforts, in line with the modified downsizing schedule.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">As stressed in the resolution, improving the overall capabilities of the National Police of Timor-Leste is a key priority. We are encouraged to note that the workshop on capacity-building of the police, for which Japan was pleased to provide funding, was successfully held last week. We hope that it will contribute to implementing the recommendations of the joint assessment mission on policing.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">Just one week ago, Senior Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, Ms. Ramos-Horta, visited Japan and met with Foreign Minister Kawaguchi. On that occasion, Mr. Ramos-Horta emphasized that security in Timor-Leste cannot be maintained solely by training and strengthening the police force, and that it is also necessary to invite investment and create job opportunities. We could not agree with him more strongly. Japan has been playing a major role in providing assistance for building a self-sustainable nation of Timor-Leste. We have been steadily implementing our pledge of assistance of up to $60 million over the period of three years after independence, with a focus on peace-building, as well as on reconstruction in three key areas: agriculture, infrastructure and human resource development. Above all, human resource development is of particular importance because it is the very basis of nation-building. With the aim of enhancing national stability, which is a prerequisite for development, we have already allocated $8 million for improving health conditions and reducing poverty, as well as for providing employment opportunities for ex-combatants through the Recovery, Employment and Stability Programme for Ex-Combatants and Communities in Timor-Leste (RESPECT). The Government of Japan has also recently decided to extend an additional $470,000 for the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation to facilitate national reconciliation in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">Mindful of the challenges that remain in Timor-Leste, I wish to re-emphasize the importance for the leadership of Timor-Leste of being united in leading the country; for the people of Timor-Leste of participating in the nation-building effort as a matter of their own responsibility, and for the international community of continuing to extend its support. For its part, the Government of Japan will spare no effort to extend as much assistance as it can for the consolidation of peace in Timor-Leste.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">I should like at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this public meeting of the Security Council on the situation in Timor-Leste. We would also like to welcome the presence of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">We often refer to Timor-Leste as a United Nations success story in general, and as a success story for this body in particular. Almost a year has gone by since the Council celebrated, in this Chamber, the independence of that country, and almost eight months have passed since Timor-Leste joined the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">However, the fact that this has been a success story does not mean that everything has gone as planned, nor that the role of the United Nations in the country is over. The latest report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) make this clear. The report indicates that progress has been achieved as well as important initiatives taken by the Government of Timor-Leste in the promotion of transparency and in the responsible management of public affairs, as well as in the promotion of human rights. As the report indicates, the support of the international community for these initiatives will be key if they are to be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">Many other objectives remain to be achieved for which the continued support of the international community will also be necessary. The report lists the tremendous difficulties in terms of economic and social development which are yet to be tackled and also indicates major challenges in the area of administrative and judicial training, and in particular in the area of the maintenance of security.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">As we saw at the end of last year and at the beginning of this one, Timor-Leste still faces serious threat to law and order. The Council shows its ability to react by adopting, on 4 April last, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, which postponed the downsizing of the military component of UNMISET to the planned end of the Mission.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">We welcome the wise decision to accede to the request of the Secretary-General, which will allow more time to establish and train the Timorese forces to exercise the fundamental activities of guaranteeing public security and ensuring the territorial integrity of the country. We therefore support an extension of UNMISET's mandate to May 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">The importance of the current efforts of the United Nations in Timor-Leste goes beyond the reality of that small country. The results that have been achieved show the effectiveness of coordinated actions at the multilateral level and the international community's ability to act through this body. The incidents of December 2002 and January 2003 served, however, as a reminder of the temporary nature of incomplete solutions. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1473 (2003)</a> was a proper and immediate reaction to the situation, and it seems to have led to the necessary adjustments for a short-term solution.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">The continued support of the international community, in order to make it possible to conclude the training process in Timor-Leste, will be crucial if we want this success story to continue.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">Brazil, to the extent possible, will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations and of the Government of Timor-Leste on the path to building its institutions, in order to foster the economic and social development of the country and of its people.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. MacKay</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">New Zealand welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) and the steady progress in implementing UNMISET's mandate. We also congratulate Timor-Leste on its engagement with the international system, the setting up of a Government administration in such a short time-frame, and its commitment to upholding the ideals of human rights and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">The Secretary-General's report says, however, that a number of challenges remain. Ongoing efforts will need to be made and attention paid to developing capable security forces, progressing border demarcation, fostering participatory democracy and open government, developing a strong judicial system, and bringing to justice those responsible for human rights violations in the territory in 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">New Zealand commends the responsiveness of the Security Council to security developments on the ground in Timor-Leste and the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>, providing for an adjustment in the timetable for downsizing the military and police components of UNMISET. It is clear that the recent security-related incidents were beyond the ability of the domestic police force, and in this respect we particularly welcome the measures in the resolution aimed at supporting and strengthening the police sector in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">We also endorse the Secretary-General's appeal for donors to consider targeted support to the police sector. We acknowledge that this is a sector which will require ongoing assistance even after the end of the UNMISET mandate. New Zealand, at its recently held bilateral assistance talks with the Timorese Government, pledged that it would focus part of its bilateral assistance programme on police development through agreed multilateral and bilateral projects, especially in the areas of community policing and civilian support.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">A functioning judicial system is clearly important for social and political stability. The Secretary-General's report notes that problems still remain in the justice sector. New Zealand is particularly concerned that Timor-Leste establish a functioning Court of Appeal as soon as possible. The recent appointment of the President of the Court of Appeal is a welcome development in this respect. New Zealand is also concerned about the large numbers of prisoners held on remand, including a significant number whose warrants for their incarceration have expired.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">New Zealand congratulates the Timor-Leste Government on its initiative to develop a more open system of government, with its series of visits to the districts by Members of Parliament and officials to promote discussion of Government policy and to receive feedback. As regards addressing the grievances of former combatants and veterans, we welcome the work of the two Commissions established by the President's Office to identify veterans who served from 1975-1979 and 1980-1999. We hope that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) "Recovery, Employment and Stability Programme for Ex-Combatants and Communities in Timor-Leste" will draw, and build upon, the work already undertaken by the commissions.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">New Zealand also welcomes the work of the United Nations Serious Crimes Unit in Timor-Leste and notes the recent series of indictments issued by the Unit for crimes against humanity. We hope that all the parties involved will take the steps necessary to bring the individuals involved to trial. We are closely watching the separate ad hoc tribunal process in Jakarta and reiterate comments made previously that this process must meet international standards of justice.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Finally, we agree with the report's assessment that, while progress has been steady, much remains to be done. Continued support from the international community will be vital to enable Timor-Leste to address the political, economic and security challenges that lie ahead. The United Nations also plays a vital support role in this. New Zealand commends the leadership of Special Representative Sharma in implementing UNMISET's mandate and endorses its renewal for a further 12 months. I should like also to thank Mr. Sharma for his introduction of the report here today.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Fiji. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Savua</span> <span class="nation">Fiji</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to address the Council on this important issue. Through you, I wish to thank the Permanent Representative of Timor-Leste for the cooperation that his Government has lent to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). We also acknowledge the Secretary-General's report, introduced by Mr. Karmalesh Sharma, on the progress of transition of responsibilities in Timor-Leste, but for some remaining areas of challenge, and on the detailed military strategy for downsizing the Mission, as requested in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1473(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1473 (2003)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">Of the remaining challenges, the one of particular concern to Fiji is the reported increased activities in recent months of armed groups and former militia elements that are intent on destabilizing the country. With this in mind, the Secretary-General's call for international military capability is strongly endorsed by Fiji and we stand ready to boost our present commitment within our military capability in this area in order to assist in the timely and peaceful exit of UNMISET.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">We can expect optimism when the implementation of the Security Council mandate is reaching milestones. Reality also requires the Organization to periodically revisit its goalposts. We have to be cautious and hope that the accelerated pace of positive developments in all sectors of Timor-Leste will be synonymous with sustained peace and stability for the country and that the planned drawdown of the military security personnel will not be a window of opportunity for destabilizing elements to re-establish their interests in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">We are mindful of the need for caution with respect to the fragility of any peace-building exercise. Timor-Leste is no exception. It is also a situation that has produced results, which are benefits that the Timorese people deserve and which flow from the investment of the international community. In Timor-Leste, we are engaged in a careful balancing of securing a peaceful setting within which training for the local police and defence forces can be accomplished, alongside other public-sector transitions. In doing so, we are concerned to leave all the decision-making to the Government and people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">In this connection, we recall the Secretary-General's own caution, expressed in paragraph 35 of his special report, on the need to execute downsizing that is sensitive to the Government's desire to assume responsibility for security issues in a feasible way and that does not jeopardize its stability. Our primary concern here is not to compromise the confidence, capacity and capability of Timor-Leste's fledgling military and security forces with a rushed time line and anticipated operational demands. In this, however, we support the proposal to strengthen the role of the civilian police in the capacity-building exercise of the Timor-Leste National Police. We believe that, while the military can deter further acts of violence, it is the police that establish the foundations of long-term peace, stability and law abidance for nations and their peoples.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">We would close, therefore, by endorsing the Secretary-General's request to this Council in paragraph 64 of his report to extend the mandate of UNMISET for a further year, until 20 May 2004. In so doing, we look forward to the consultation process with the troop-contributing countries on the options that are being developed for the operations of and interactions between each military organization, as the Secretary-General undertakes in his report.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Percaya</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa01">Permit me to express the gratitude of my delegation to you, Sir, for convening this meeting. Like previous speakers before us, my delegation also welcomes the presence of Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma to introduce the report of the Secretary-General and for his comprehensive briefing to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa02">As indicated in the report, we are pleased to learn of the progress achieved in Timor-Leste. Indeed, Timor-Leste has taken significant steps forward in solidifying its position at the regional and global levels, notably as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. In this regard, my Government stands ready to work together with the Government of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa03">It is also gratifying to record that our bilateral relations are steadily flourishing, thus serving our common interests in many spheres, including border demarcation. Indonesia has embraced Timor-Leste as part of many regional forums and initiatives. There is no doubt that Indonesia and Timor-Leste continue to be steadfast in building stronger relations between them as two friendly neighbouring countries. Our common history has taught us that arriving at a stable and mutually beneficial relationship should be based upon a forward-looking attitude.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa04">The phase, the substance and the priorities of our relations, however, should be fully determined by us as two sovereign States. The international community and the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) should be fully appreciative and supportive of this principle. After all, when UNMISET's planned mandate ends in May 2004, the two countries, as eternal neighbours, have no alternative but to strengthen their bilateral relations. In doing so, we will eliminate the need for any third party to influence the nature and course of our interaction.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa05">Timor-Leste has been widely considered a success story for the international community. Much of the credit should go to the perseverance of the East Timorese themselves and other dedicated international personalities. One cannot forget, however, that the non-existence of favourable cooperation and an unwillingness to be reconciled make it difficult for other peacekeeping operations to emulate this success. Rather than supporting the distinctive and laudable situation between our two nations, some quarters tend to disregard it and even attempt to inflict other agendas on us that would surely disrupt our shared vision.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa06">As the first anniversary of Timor-Leste's independence approaches, it is high time for the international community to permit a more progressive transfer of operational responsibilities to the East Timorese. UNMISET, to be faithful to its name and mandate, is to provide assistance to a sovereign entity, as stipulated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1410(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1410 (2002)</a>. We believe that UNMISET, as a true peacekeeping mission, will honour its exit strategy and not reluctantly surrender it on the basis of a careful assessment on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa07">My delegation cannot but note with concern prejudices expressed in the report on certain issues, in particular concerning security at the border and justice. My Government's position and strong commitment in these endeavours need no reiteration.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa08">In view of the efforts of both Indonesia and Timor-Leste to develop good and friendly relations, the steadily growing relationship between the two countries is far too important to allow any issue that might arise to disrupt this relationship. As our bilateral relations continue to flourish at all levels, we call on the international community, as well as the United Nations, to support them.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">I promise not to test the patience of representatives too much, but many observations have been made and I would indeed like to make comments on at least some of them.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">To begin with, I wish to thank all delegations for the views, points of emphasis, assessments and advice which they have given on the work of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET). I can assure them that I have taken very careful note of them and that I and my colleagues will profit from them.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">I also wish to thank delegations for their expressions of support and appreciation for UNMISET's work. They are a great encouragement to me and to my many colleagues, who are responsible for any useful contribution that we may have been able to make. Here, I wish to express my deep appreciation for the committed and sterling support that I have consistently received from all of my colleagues. After every appearance before the Council, I brief the entire staff and membership of UNMISET collectively, and I will personally convey to them the dominant sentiments expressed in the Security Council and its expectations of us. I can assure the Council that we will continue to strive to the utmost to try to fulfil its mandate to the best of our capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">I also wish to place on record the supportiveness and accessibility that I have always received from the leaders of Timor-Leste, for which I remain deeply grateful. In addition, I wish to assure individual delegations that we stand ready to provide any information or clarification on UNMISET's work that they may require, now or in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Of the many observations that were made, I should particularly like to recall those that emphasized the need to strengthen public institutions. That is a central preoccupation of ours. I should also like to endorse the observations concerning the need for the international community's continued assistance. An emphasis on human rights is obviously central to our work, and we fully support that. We will always work in the light of the highest international norms in the field of human rights, which the Government of Timor-Leste intends to observe. Lastly, the emphasis on the rule of law as a core element of the new democracy and the need to preserve and promote it are things of which we are extremely mindful, as is the Government.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Many points were covered in the statements by delegates, and I should like to throw some light on four or five of them.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">First are the many observations on the judicial system. In November 2002, the Government of Timor-Leste and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) conducted a joint mission to assess the judicial system. Those bodies are now in the process of preparing projects to strengthen the capacity of the judicial system.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">It is true that, in many respects, the courts continue to function in a haphazard manner and are in great need of assistance. It was observed here that illegal detention of persons on expired detention warrants has been an unfortunate practice. Similarly, the courts have failed to hear cases in a timely and efficient manner, and that is a major concern. While there is a lack of personnel -- which hinders efficiency -- officers of the court have also been perceived as needing to display the required understanding of the roles of judges, prosecutors and public defenders. That is a particular concern, since legislation adopted by Parliament in the future will be tested through litigation before the courts. I should emphasize that the leaders of Timor-Leste are well aware of the need to do this urgently, and we are in close interaction with them on this matter. They have an avowed commitment to democracy and the rule of law, and they have said so on a number of occasions. However, it is clear that internal will and discipline, provision of personnel and significant bilateral and multilateral assistance will all be required to improve the functioning of the justice sector, both alongside and after UNMISET. It is expected that the finalized justice sector programme will be ready by the end of June this year.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">There was a related question concerning the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal was established by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) but had been largely non-functional since December 2001. UNMISET thus found a non-functional Court of Appeal and made the greatest possible efforts to locate and employ suitable judges who would serve as judges on the Court of Appeal. In February this year, the four original members of the Superior Council of the Magistracy recommended to the President of Timor-Leste that one of those judges, Mr. Claudio Ximenes, be appointed President of the Court of Appeal. In March, the President of the Republic issued a decree appointing Mr. Ximenes to that position. There was a question as to whether the Parliament needed to ratify that, and the decree was sent to Parliament. Parliament decided by a vote last Tuesday that its ratification was not required. Therefore, the President of the Court of Appeal is now expected to be sworn in over the course of the week.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">There were comments and encouragement by many delegations urging that the target date of 30 June to agree on a line constituting the border be met. I wish to state that, at the Joint Border Committee's most recent meeting, in December, both sides agreed on a work plan that envisaged a meeting in January to compare border lines drawn from satellite imagery unilaterally by each side and the start of the field work in February. That meeting was held in March, having been delayed. Both sides adopted a new work plan, in accordance with which joint field work was to start in April. At a meeting held in Jakarta in April, both sides agreed to start the field work on 5 May. In order to meet the target date, strong commitment by both countries is needed, and further delays should, of course, be avoided.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa11">Timor-Leste will require technical and financial support to make its contribution -- particularly for the field surveys -- and UNMISET is trying to be as helpful as it can in that respect. Meeting the target date does not, of course, depend only on accomplishing the joint survey work. We are sure that both sides are mindful of the requirement to continue negotiating in good faith, on the basis of the 1904 treaty agreed upon by both sides as the legal basis for the international boundary. The developments so far have been extremely promising, as noted by many delegates, and we hope that the process will continue in the same spirit.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa12">Some delegations asked about the operational readiness of the National Police of Timor-Leste (PNTL) to take over internal security challenges after the United Nations peacekeeping force (UNPKF) and the United Nations police (UNPOL) have left. Many challenges do indeed lie ahead, particularly in relation to the level of readiness that the PNTL will have achieved by around this time next year.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa13">The police force has to be ready to meet internal security threats in the future. In essence, there are four main challenges. First and foremost is that of working towards the creation of an impartial, non-partisan, apolitical, efficient and accountable police force. That will require a mix of legislation, regulations and training.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa14">The second challenge is that of appropriate provisioning of the Border Patrol Unit, to which some delegations have referred. The Government, UNMISET and troop-contributing countries, through the donation of their facilities to the PNTL, are trying to address this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa15">The third relates to the creation of the rapid deployment groups. The following elements need to be considered in depth: their size, composition and physical location; their standard operating procedures and the training to be given to them; and the supply of appropriate armaments and other equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa16">Finally, the training and development of rapid intervention units to deal with urban disorder would be facilitated through the stationing of an internationally formed unit approved by the Council, as this would provide the rapid intervention units more time to develop and consolidate. We hope to achieve that end successful as well.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa17">However, development of the police can take place effectively only against a backdrop of general respect for the rule of law. An honest, efficient and accountable police force but one which, for instance, is forced to accept illegal detentions due to problems in the judiciary or in the correctional system cannot command the trust and confidence of the community it polices. Improvements in the delivery of justice, particularly in this Year of Administrative Restructuring and Justice in Timor-Leste announced by the Prime Minister, are critical if the police force is to grow into the social and professional role expected of it. The Government realizes that very well.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa18">There was a reference to the workshop which was concluded just a couple of days ago. It was indeed a very successful workshop. It succeeded in making the development of the PNTL a participatory process. It attracted high-level, active participation from the Timor-Leste leadership; from ambassadors and other representatives from several countries, including those based in Jakarta; from senior officers and the rank and file of the PNTL; and from representatives of various sectors of society in Timor-Leste. It promoted a sense of ownership among all stakeholders in this critical process. It also demonstrated the Government's commitment to making the PNTL a professional and accountable force equal to the challenges before it. As President Gusmão said at the workshop, the police must appear in the eyes of society to be the guardians of order.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa19">It has been decided that another workshop will be held very shortly -- at the end of May or in early June -- in which the role of the various wings of the police that are being created will be further discussed, because there was not enough time to go into this in the required detail. This in itself is an indication of the success of the workshop: that it is mindful of the need to complete the work it started.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa20">There were questions about situations on the ground at the present time. The recent attacks by the armed groups were on an exceptional scale. In my statement I mentioned that even if numerically, compared to many other regions in the world, they may have looked not all that serious, the requirement is to look at them in the context of the immediate past from which the nation is emerging and of the future challenges which an extrapolation of incidents of this type could pose to the country. Then we can evaluate these developments in the context required. Those attacks involved heavily armed personnel. They were well equipped, and their level of tactical training and awareness made their tracking and apprehension a challenging task, even for capable forces.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa21">These occurrences do not lend themselves to easy distinctions between external and internal threats. They lie in a grey area between the two. But what is certain is that they need to be dealt with by military forces in the immediate term, and probably largely by augmented Timorese forces in the long term. Neither have the civil disturbances we have seen been apolitical. The riots in Dili appeared to have included the careful targeting of property, which would undermine confidence in the Government.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa22">At this nascent stage of the country's development, any perception of a possible return to violence and disorder would exacerbate the sense of insecurity in the population and must therefore be effectively combated. I am most grateful to the Council for having strengthened our hand so that we will be able to do what is needed.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa23">I should add that, following these incidents, the Government has encouraged the formation of village-based security groups to assist the police and the peacekeeping force in looking out for infiltrators. Since January, high-ranking Government officials have often spoken about the importance of the population being the eyes and ears of the police and bringing information or suspicious people directly to the authorities. Such civic-education messages are understandable in a country where there is not a police presence in each village. The wounds of 1999 are still fresh, and there remains considerable and understandable fear in the community about the possibility of a resurgence of violence in the country. But civilian security groups are nothing new in Timor-Leste; indeed, such groups are common throughout the region. And even without Government direction from above, it is probable that Timorese in rough urban neighbourhoods and in isolated, largely unpoliced, villages will form their own security groups.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa24">However, there are grounds for concern that some of those groups could take vigilance to the point of vigilantism. That is of considerable concern not least because of the possible undermining effect it could have on the PNTL, which must remain at the centre of international efforts to establish the rule of law. UNMISET has been in discussion with the Government on this issue, and the Government is fully cognizant of it as well. To date, there is little evidence to suggest that these groups are incorporated into wider structures that could be used for political purposes, but that possibility also needs to be monitored.</p>
