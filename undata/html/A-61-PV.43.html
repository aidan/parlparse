<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kodera</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">At the outset, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Mohammed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his detailed briefing on the activities of the Agency over the past year. The IAEA will commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of its establishment next year, and attention to and interest in its roles have never been greater than they are today. The fact that Mr. ElBaradei and the Agency were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year testifies to the continued strong interest of the international community in the IAEA and the high regard in which it is held.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">In recent years, the role of nuclear energy has been re-evaluated, and the momentum for the promotion of nuclear energy has grown across the globe. Its use must be promoted in a manner that fully takes into account the various elements of nuclear proliferation, safety and security. From this perspective, the role of the IAEA has taken on even greater importance than in the past.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">Japan has utilized nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, gaining the confidence of the international community and maintaining high transparency through the faithful implementation of its IAEA safeguards agreement, for nearly 30 years. As a result, in September 2004 implementation of the integrated safeguards commenced in Japan. Japan is committed to fully cooperating with the IAEA in ensuring strict implementation of the safeguards in Japan.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">The second matter I would like to raise is the reinforcement of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime. Notwithstanding achievements in this area -- including the progress made towards the universalization of the additional protocol, the amendment of the Nuclear Suppliers Group Guidelines and the establishment of the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification -- the global non-proliferation regime still faces serious challenges, such as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iranian nuclear issues. We must therefore redouble our efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">In order to address the issue of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, while ensuring consistency with non-proliferation requirements, various proposals to control nuclear fuel cycles under an international or multilateral framework have been put forward. They include the multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle -- multilateral nuclear approaches -- proposed by Mr. ElBaradei. Japan, for its part, has proposed the establishment of an IAEA standby arrangement system for nuclear fuel supply, with a view to complementing the content of the six-nation initiative on reliable access to nuclear fuel.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">Finally, I would like to comment on two issues that pose an imminent challenge to the international community: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Iranian nuclear issues. The announcement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 9 October 2006, local time, that it had conducted a nuclear test shocked the entire international community. The announcement of the nuclear test, despite the call by the Security Council in a presidential statement that it refrain from testing, is totally unacceptable, all the more so given that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently launched ballistic missiles that can be used as a means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">These actions by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pose a serious threat to peace and security in East Asia and to the international community as a whole. Japan strongly calls upon the Democratic People's Republic to respect <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1718 (2006)</a>, which was adopted unanimously on 14 October. The Democratic People's Republic must refrain from actions that would further aggravate the situation; abandon all nuclear weapons and its existing nuclear programmes; act in accordance with the conditions set out in the IAEA safeguards; provide information on steps on transparency measures; and implement the requirements set out in the resolution, including returning without any preconditions to the Six-Party Talks.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa08">Japan, for its part, will fully implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1718 (2006)</a>, adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter, and requests other Member States to do the same.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa09">On Iran, it is regrettable that the country is continuing uranium enrichment in defiance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1696(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1696 (2006)</a>. The question here is not whether Iran has the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Such a right can only be exercised when Iran has taken the required steps to restore the confidence of the international community lost as a result of its past activities. Japan strongly urges Iran to accept <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1696(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1696 (2006)</a>, immediately suspend uranium enrichment-related activities and return to the negotiating table. Japan believes this is the best option and will benefit all parties concerned. Japan will work in concert with the international community to achieve a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa10">Today I have stated my Government's position on some of the challenges that confront the Agency. There are other important issues that have relevance to nuclear energy, such as anti-nuclear-terrorism measures; international cooperation for the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy; nuclear safety; and transport of radioactive materials.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa11">In 2007 the preparatory process of the 2010 NPT Review Conference will begin. Japan will continue to work closely with the IAEA to ensure a smooth start to this process.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa12">I conclude my statement by informing the General Assembly that Japan co-sponsored the draft resolution introduced by the representative of Slovenia, and will vote in favour of it.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hamidon</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">I join others in thanking Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his presentation of the Agency's annual report for 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa02">It was a year of notable success for the Agency in its efforts to ensure that the benefits of nuclear technology were shared globally for economic and social development. My delegation commends the excellent work and efforts of the Agency, under the dynamic leadership of Mr. ElBaradei, in fulfilling its mandate during the period under review.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa03">Malaysia recognizes the value of nuclear technology for the achievement of sustainable development and the process of nation-building, and the value of the role played by the Agency in that regard. We reaffirm our support for the Agency in its mission to promote and facilitate the development of nuclear technology for peaceful uses, as embodied in article II of its Statute. In that connection, the Technical Cooperation Programme of the Agency remains a crucial component of its mandate and activities. Malaysia is both a donor to and a recipient of the Programme, and we commend the Department of Technical Cooperation of the IAEA for its continuous efforts in discharging its statutory mandate for the benefit of recipient member States, as well as for its creditable achievements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa04">The Director General of the IAEA, during his opening statement at the fiftieth regular session of the IAEA General Conference, identified three distinct phases: the establishment of mechanisms for the assurance of supplies of fuel for nuclear power plants as the first phase; the development of assurances of supply for the acquisition of nuclear power reactors as the second phase; and the conversion of existing uranium enrichment and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities from national to multilateral operations as the third phase.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa05">Although we support such a move towards improving assurances of supplies in the field of nuclear power generation technology, while also reducing the risks of the further proliferation of sensitive technologies that can be used in the development of nuclear weapons, that should by no means lead to any unilateral adoption of a norm that will affect the fundamental inalienable rights of the States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to engage in research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without discrimination. Such a move should also not distract global attention from the obligations of nuclear-weapon States to undertake to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament. Despite the overwhelming global attention to nuclear non-proliferation, Malaysia remains firmly convinced that the pursuit of general, complete and irreversible nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control is the most effective way of removing the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa06">Nevertheless, my delegation believes that such a multilateral approach to the nuclear fuel cycle should provide a more economically attractive option for developing countries embarking on a nuclear power generation programme, particularly for those countries with a relatively small nuclear power programme involving only a handful of nuclear power plants.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa07">Malaysia also believes that the strengthening of the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and the establishment of new nuclear-weapon-free zones in all regions of the world, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, constitute a positive step towards attaining the objective of global nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa08">In that regard, Malaysia welcomes the signing of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in Semipalatinsk on 8 September 2006. Malaysia considers the establishment of that newest nuclear-weapon-free zone to be an effective contribution to the strengthening of regional and global peace and security, and urges the nuclear-weapon States to provide unconditional assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against all the States of that Zone.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa09">In that connection also, Malaysia reiterates its call for the prompt establishment of a similar nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-487(1981).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 487 (1981)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-687(1991).pdf" class="pdf">687 (1991)</a> and relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus. Malaysia calls upon Israel to promptly place all its nuclear facilities under IAEA full-scope safeguards, in accordance with the <a href="../pdf/S-RES-487(1981).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 487 (1981)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa10">Closer to home, my delegation remains concerned over the continued unwillingness of a majority of the nuclear-weapon States to sign the Protocol to the Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which was signed by all 10 Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa11">Malaysia appreciates the high premium placed by the global community on the issue of nuclear security, in view of the serious threats of mass transnational terrorism, including that of nuclear and radiological terrorism. However, this has led to the development of a multitude of overlapping initiatives by a number of international organizations, including the IAEA, in the same area. Such overlapping nuclear and other related international security initiatives have since imposed a heavy burden on the work of the relevant Government agencies, and posed new challenges to inter-agency coordination in member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa12">In order to optimize the utilization of resources and ensure effective inter-agency coordination between the responsible authorities in member States, my delegation calls upon the IAEA to coordinate the implementation of its nuclear security initiatives with that of other relevant multilateral organizations, especially within the framework of the United Nations, such as between the IAEA and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate of the Security Council. That is imperative, since different international organizations have different counterpart agencies in the member States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa13">On the implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia again reiterates its recognition of the IAEA as the sole competent authority for the verification of the safeguards obligations of that country and other Member States, and further stresses that there should be no undue pressure or interference in the activities of the IAEA in that regard -- particularly on verification -- which could jeopardize its efficiency and credibility. While Malaysia took note of the assessment of the IAEA Director General that all nuclear material declared by Iran had been accounted for, we nevertheless urgently encourage Iran to continue to cooperate actively and fully with the IAEA, within the Agency's mandate, in order to resolve the outstanding issues towards the promotion of confidence and a peaceful resolution of the matter.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa14">Turning to the issue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Malaysia deplores the nuclear test which that country claims to have conducted on 9 October 2006. Malaysia believes that the test is a serious setback to efforts aimed at keeping the region and the world free from nuclear weapons. It could also trigger an arms race in the region. Therefore, we call on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to cease developing its capability to produce nuclear weapons and to return to the moratorium on nuclear testing.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa15">We also strongly believe that the continued existence of nuclear weapons presents a grave threat to humanity, particularly by increasing the risk of proliferation. We therefore reiterate the importance of achieving the universal goal of complete and general disarmament. Malaysia urges all countries in the region to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from actions that could further heighten tension in the region. In that context, Malaysia further urges all parties concerned to return to the Six-Party Talks and resume negotiations with a view to resolving all outstanding issues amicably.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa16">Finally, Malaysia would like to express once again its appreciation to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, as well as to the IAEA secretariat, for their significant and valuable work in fulfilling the three pillars of the Agency's mandate. Malaysia pledges its full support to the IAEA, as one of the organizations of the United Nations system that continue to uphold and maintain their central and universal role in addressing the enormous challenges ahead.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Musa Daffalla</span> <span class="nation">Sudan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to express my profound gratitude and appreciation to the President for her efforts in organizing today's debate and guiding the Assembly's work so judiciously and skilfully, in fulfilment of the great aspirations and responsibilities of this major organ of our international Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">We also express our thanks and appreciation to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his comprehensive report, which contains a detailed account of the Agency's work and programmes in the area of the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and ensuring the safety of nuclear and radiological facilities. The warm reception he received and the honours bestowed upon him by numerous academic and scientific institutions reflect the growing trust placed in the Agency, and show how much the Director General is appreciated in higher scientific circles and by civil organizations' personalities.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">Fifty years after the creation of the IAEA, despite the enormous transformations witnessed in the world, the Agency has remained a haven of cooperation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and for development. My delegation welcomes the final statement of the meeting organized by the Agency in Paris in March last year to study the role of nuclear power in the future, which affirmed that nuclear power can contribute significantly to meeting the energy requirements of a large number of developing and developed countries in the twenty-first century and enhancing international development.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">We pay tribute to the Agency for its efforts to heed international public opinion regarding the use of nuclear energy to generate electricity. The report highlights the growing importance of nuclear energy in improving standards of living in developing countries, given that such energy provides 16 per cent of the world's electricity.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">My delegation also supports the Agency's efforts, undertaken in cooperation with various scientific partners, to create new and improved vaccines in the context of the nuclear medicine programme, especially with regard to cancer, which is one of the most deadly diseases.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">Despite the fact that the report indicates that 156 States have concluded safeguards agreements with the Agency, and that their nuclear programmes and facilities have remained peaceful, my delegation recalls the Final Document of the meeting of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Cuba, which reaffirmed the right of States to engage in research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without discrimination, in accordance with international obligations. It also reaffirmed that the IAEA should remain the only competent authority to verify the obligations of member States regarding safeguards. States must therefore refrain from bringing pressure to bear on the Agency or interfering in its activities, so as not to undermine its credibility or subvert its effectiveness.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">We therefore call for an approach based on equity and justice in dealing with outstanding issues in relation to certain countries in this regard. Double standards must be renounced and dialogue and constructive negotiation reaffirmed, with a view to reaching an effective solution in accordance with international obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">My delegation supports the statement made by the Director General this morning. We support peaceful solutions and believe that international concerns and expectations in the area of peace and security must be upheld. Every year my delegation reaffirms that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the linchpin of international peace and security. The Sudan supports the aspirations of all geographic regions to declare themselves free from nuclear weapons. However, the Middle East has been spinning its wheels for decades because of the refusal of Israel, the only country in the Middle East that possesses nuclear weapons, to sign the Treaty and its additional protocol. Many members of the international community have appealed to Israel to change its position and sign the Treaty so as to put an end to the tension in the region and pave the way for comprehensive peace, which benefits everyone. If Israel does not do so, the causes of tension will remain and States will seek to possess nuclear weapons for self-defence and deterrence purposes. Declaring the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone would be the best way to bridge the gap and consolidate regional security and international peace.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">My delegation greatly appreciates the efforts of the Technical Cooperation Department in assisting countries to upgrade their country and regional programme frameworks. We take note of the budget set by the Agency for the African continent. However, greater funds are required if the continent is to achieve its goals. Additional resources must be provided in the general budget of the IAEA, and donors must be encouraged to provide grants in support of relevant programmes in Africa. We are hopeful that Africa will receive the major share this year, as Europe did last year. We call on the Agency to increase its funding to the least developed countries, which account for only 16 per cent of general expenditure. Helping developing countries to upgrade their legislative systems complements the efforts of the Agency in implementing technical cooperation programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa10">We hope that effective efforts will be made to combat malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, since malaria is the deadliest disease in Africa, and to eliminate the tsetse fly, with sophisticated technologies. Great hopes are pinned on these efforts to achieve social and economic development in developing countries.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mayoral</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">At the outset I thank Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his presentation of the report on the activities on the Agency last year. As it approaches its fiftieth anniversary, the Agency, under the guidance of Mr. ElBaradei, has demonstrated its effectiveness and dedication in the control and monitoring of the nuclear energy activities of all States.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I would like to touch on a central aspect of what my country, Argentina, is currently doing in conjunction with Brazil. The Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) celebrates its fifteenth anniversary this year. ABACC is the result of a process of mutual confidence and transparency in a very sensitive and important technological area: the development and application of nuclear technology. It is a substantive mechanism that reflects the convergence of the nuclear policies of Brazil and Argentina and their integration in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The process began many years ago. Milestones along the way include the joint presidential Declaration of Foz de Iguazú of 1985, the Declaration of Viedma in 1987 and the Declaration of Ipero of 1988. These were followed by others in 1990 -- in particular, the joint declaration of Argentina and Brazil on a common nuclear policy.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Over these 15 years, ABACC has successfully applied the Common System for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials, obtaining positive conclusions regarding nuclear activities under its control. This has been made possible thanks to the Argentine and Brazilian staff, whose expertise and commitment to the objectives and spirit of ABACC have been, and continue to be, essential to its continuity and growth.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">Another point to be highlighted is ABACC's credibility at the national and international levels, which is closely linked to the characteristics I have described and the unflagging support of successive Governments of both countries for this important confidence-building mechanism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">In this anniversary year, it is particularly important to highlight also the importance of the IAEA and ABACC continuing their joint efforts to avoid duplication in the work of introducing new, strengthened international safeguards. Both the Common System and ABACC have a growing role in the framework of the Quadripartite Safeguards Agreement; both the Common System and the organization established by the two countries for its administration, ABACC, are of the utmost importance in the current context, in which there is a new impetus for nuclear development for peaceful purposes in both countries and in the world. They are also of particular relevance with regard to safeguards at the international level at a complex moment of change. ABACC has actively participated in the framework of the safeguards agreement with the IAEA, carrying out coordinated inspections and auditing, sharing equipment and technology with the Agency, designing control approaches, establishing joint inspection procedures and taking steps to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Before concluding, I would like to stress that this Argentina-Brazil bilateral mechanism was made possible by the fact that, after years of competition and rivalry, the two countries decided to act together to make a reality of the integration of the countries of South America.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hannesson</span> <span class="nation">Iceland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">At the outset let me thank the Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, for his report on the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iceland is one of the sponsoring States of the draft resolution on the IAEA report.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the IAEA, and on this occasion we look back with appreciation on its accomplishments and important work. The IAEA is the world's focal point for peaceful nuclear cooperation and nuclear safety, and it has an indispensable global role in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and countering new threats of nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">The accomplishments of the Agency and its valuable work were highlighted by the Nobel Peace Prize received by the IAEA and its Director General for 2005. Iceland congratulates Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei and his staff on this recognition of their important work.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">We reaffirm our commitment to the three pillars of the IAEA Statute: verification, safety and technology, which form the basis for the activities of the Agency. States must honour their commitments, and we urge member States to comply transparently and effectively with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and IAEA safeguard obligations, and allow full IAEA verification of all nuclear activities.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">In this context, Iceland strongly condemned the recent nuclear test carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to return to compliance with the NPT and IAEA safeguards obligations, and allow for full IAEA verification of all its nuclear activities.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">Iceland supports the Director General and the IAEA in their efforts to seek clarifications from Iran and to verify its nuclear programme. It is of concern that the Director General's assessment is that, after four years of intense inspections, the Agency remains unable to make further progress in its efforts to verify the correctness and completeness of Iran's declaration, in order to confirm the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Iceland attaches the greatest importance to a high level of safety in all nuclear and radiation applications. Safety is a national responsibility, but has implications well beyond national boundaries. International cooperation is therefore indispensable in order to maintain and improve safety in all nuclear and radiation applications.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">Iceland appreciates the activities of the IAEA in fostering a global nuclear safety regime, and welcomes the efforts over recent years to update and extend the IAEA safety standards to cover all important thematic areas, facilities and activities. To assist in this effort, Iceland has undertaken to chair the IAEA Radiation Safety Standards Committee for the period 2005 to 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">On a national level, Iceland has this year ratified the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and urges other Member States to do so as well. Iceland has also ratified the Convention on Assistance in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">Finally, Iceland attaches great importance to the IAEA efforts to improve the quality of technical cooperation, in the interest of all Member States -- in particular, the developing countries. Iceland contributes annually to the IAEA Technical Cooperation Fund.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rachkov</span> <span class="nation">Belarus</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">The delegation of the Republic of Belarus has considered with satisfaction the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for 2005. The Government of Belarus appreciates the activities of the IAEA during this period.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The work of the IAEA over recent years has proved that the Agency has become a truly leading international organization, entrusted with ensuring the secure development and use of nuclear energy in civil activities, as well as the effective monitoring of the implementation of international obligations on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Member States of the Agency and its secretariat have done significant work in the nuclear sphere. Thorough measures are being undertaken to secure a global regime of nuclear and radiation safety. A plan of action against nuclear terrorism is being implemented. Measures to strengthen the physical security of nuclear and radioactive materials are being taken.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">There are also consistent steps to universalize the nuclear non-proliferation regime and increase the effectiveness of the IAEA safeguards system, together with activities to accumulate knowledge in the sphere of nuclear sciences and training of experts in this field. Within the framework of the Technical Cooperation Programme, member States receive multifaceted assistance in the use of advanced nuclear technologies in medicine, power engineering and other fields, in order to promote socio-economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The sense of purpose and professionalism of the IAEA staff and its Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, were duly rewarded when they received the 2005 Nobel Prize. This high recognition of the results of their work should give an additional impetus to the joint activities of the secretariat and member States within the framework of the mechanisms provided for in the IAEA Statute for the full implementation of the IAEA's main motto -- Atoms for Peace.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Being a member of the Board of Governors, the Republic of Belarus actively promotes the achievement of the IAEA's objectives and the fulfilment of its tasks. We consider the IAEA technical cooperation mechanisms to be important tools to introduce innovative ideas, technologies and experience in the nuclear sphere. The implementation of IAEA technical cooperation projects in Belarus significantly supports national efforts in a number of spheres, from health protection to the prevention of illegal trafficking in nuclear materials.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">In the context of IAEA efforts to accumulate knowledge in the nuclear sphere, Belarus is particularly interested in IAEA training courses related to radiation safety. Belarus actively participates in this process and has for several years hosted annual regional training programmes on source radiation protection and security, with the participation of experts from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Eastern European countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Belarus is a staunch and consistent supporter of the strengthening and universalization of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. It unswervingly fulfils its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the IAEA comprehensive safeguards agreement. In November 2005, the Republic of Belarus and the IAEA signed the additional protocol to the agreement. This step reconfirmed our adherence to the principles of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">In the development of nuclear technologies, we pin our hopes on the project for innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles implemented under the aegis of the IAEA. Belarus has expressed its interest in participating in this project, and we are prepared to contribute effectively to its implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">In <a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-14.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/14</a>, "Strengthening of international cooperation and coordination of efforts to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster", the General Assembly noted with satisfaction the assistance rendered by the IAEA to Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine on remediation of agricultural and urban environments, cost-effective agricultural countermeasures and the monitoring of human exposure in areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster. That is a fair assessment of the IAEA efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">The successful completion of work of the Chernobyl Forum, in which the IAEA played an organizational and coordinating role, was of great importance to Belarus. Significant work has been done to assess the health, ecological and socio-economic consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, whose twentieth anniversary was commemorated in April this year. Numerous comprehensive recommendations for actively encouraging international cooperation in these spheres were developed by the Forum. We call on the IAEA to make a constructive contribution to the implementation of those recommendations. Belarus is ready to broaden its interaction with the IAEA with a view to overcoming the Chernobyl legacy more rapidly and returning the region that has suffered from the disaster to a normal life.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Owoseni</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The Nigerian delegation welcomes the status report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), presented this morning by its Director General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, and commends him for his consistent diligence, dedication and effective leadership over the years. We note the broad variety of activities conducted over the year that he reported upon, relating to the three main areas of the Agency's core mandate: nuclear technology, safety and security, and verification.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">Nigeria enjoys a robust relationship with the IAEA, and strongly supports the efforts of the international community in strengthening the Agency's work and its capacity to discharge its vital role in the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful uses, in technology transfer to developing countries, and in ensuring that peaceful nuclear energy is used in the safest possible way.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">The Agency's activities and the scope of its mandate will naturally continue to attract increased global interest in the years ahead, as well as pose greater, and sometimes newer, challenges, some of which I shall touch upon.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">As we note from the report, there are rising expectations for the expansion of nuclear power, emphasizing the need for energy for development, including nuclear applications for human benefits. Topical issues, such as progress and new initiatives in nuclear safety, security and verification, the strides made under the Technical Cooperation Programme, the Agency's management and funding, as well as the need for a new multilateral framework for the nuclear fuel cycle, will all continue to actively engage the serious attention of the IAEA and member States. In these areas, it is impossible to overemphasize the need for effective international cooperation in order for humanity to harness the full benefits of peaceful nuclear technology.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Nigeria appreciates the crucial role which the IAEA continues to play as a catalyst for the transfer of nuclear technology for the peaceful purposes of socio-economic development, especially for developing countries: nuclear energy, application of nuclear techniques and radioisotopes to increase food production, disease control and eradication, water resources management, protection of the environment, and industrial applications. We thus call upon the Agency to continue to exploit and expand the vistas of opportunities which nuclear technology portends in these and other fields.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">To this end, the Nigerian Government, under the current Country Programme Framework with the IAEA, has given priority to some core projects aimed at exploring the role of nuclear power as part of our future national energy plans: strengthening national infrastructure in nuclear science and technology through the installation and commissioning of an accelerator facility and the use of a miniature neutron source reactor; expanding technical capabilities in nuclear medicine diagnosis; and strengthening radiotherapy services. Other areas include efforts to strengthen the national radiation protection infrastructure; groundwater investigation through the use of isotope hydrology techniques; developing crop varieties and enhancing food safety; and human resource development and nuclear technology support.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">Our quest for nuclear energy is explained by Nigeria's large population of some 150 million people, its present low installed total energy generation capacity and the urgent need for diversification of our energy resources to meet future requirements for rapid industrialization and provision of mass employment for our people. These demand a reasonable energy mix, including the exploration of nuclear power, as part of the benefits Nigeria can derive from the Agency, while being fully conscious of our unequivocal commitment to the spirit and letter of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Treaty of Pelindaba on the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">To this end, President Obasanjo reconfirmed Nigeria's non-proliferation credentials on 31 July 2006, during the activation and inauguration of the Board of the Nigerian Atomic Energy Commission (NAEC), as the specialized agency to formulate and implement, in collaboration with the IAEA, Nigeria's nuclear energy programme. On that occasion, President Obasanjo charged the Commission, in line with the provisions of Act 46 of 1976 creating the Commission, to provide the requisite institutional framework and technical pathway to explore, exploit and harness atomic energy for peaceful applications in all its ramifications for the socio-economic development of Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">Nigeria is mindful that the adoption of nuclear energy has global implications requiring both bilateral and multilateral cooperation for a coordinated approach within the IAEA's framework. We are thus working in partnership with the Agency to create the requisite linkages with other interested member States for cooperation in the development of a sustainable energy programme from the start. We also wish to state that key components of Nigeria's obligations to the international community in the areas of safety and security, as well as the safeguards system, are being entrenched in the programme.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">To that end, and in a bid to reassure our neighbours in Africa and the international community of the peaceful nature of our future nuclear energy plans, Nigeria organized an international workshop on the Treaty of Pelindaba, which established the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, in Abuja from 8 June to 9 June this year, with the objective of sensitizing African States on the need to bring the Treaty into force, 10 years after it was opened for signature. Representatives from African diplomatic missions in Nigeria, and those of the five permanent members of the Security Council, as well as Spain, Portugal and the IAEA, were all invited and participated in the workshop. Needless to say, Nigeria was one of the first African countries to sign and ratify the Treaty.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">In a similar effort, the Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority has commenced the process of developing the requisite national regulatory capacity to cope with the eventual emergence of a nuclear power reactor programme. The process of ratifying and acceding to the relevant treaties and additional instruments necessary for the implementation of a successful national nuclear power programme, including the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, has been set in motion.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa12">Furthermore, Nigeria has established its State system of accounting for and control of nuclear material, and it submits annually to the IAEA the material accounting and balance of all safeguarded materials in Nigeria. The national policy and regulations on radioactive waste management are in place, as well as the commencement of activities for the designation and establishment of a radioactive waste management facility. Above all, adequate control over transportation and transborder movement of radioactive sources has been developed, and the requisite regulations were issued this year, with the cooperation of the IAEA and in conformity with its code of conduct on safety and security of radioactive sources.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa13">In other areas of food and agriculture and human health, Nigeria continues to be concerned about the devastating effects of insect pests, such as tsetse flies and malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, on human and livestock development in Africa. These are a major obstacle to poverty alleviation in our continent. Nigeria notes with appreciation the IAEA efforts in using both Technical Cooperation Funds and extra-budgetary contributions to support the African Union's Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (AU-PATTEC). We are also grateful to those countries that have made extrabudgetary contributions to the objectives of AU-PATTEC. In addition, my delegation thanks other development partners, as well as international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization, that have participated in the campaign.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa14">Nigeria is happy to note the remarkable success achieved in the area-wide application of the sterile insect technique against tsetse flies, aimed at creating a tsetse-fly-free-zone in Africa. Similarly, we welcome the feasibility study on developing the technique for the control and eradication of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. We note that research and development on its use in this area has commenced both in the laboratory and in the field. We urge our development partners to allocate sufficient financial, technical and material resources to promote the implementation of the feasibility study at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa15">As a measure of Nigeria's commitment to the AU-PATTEC and the development of the sterile insect technique for the control and eradication of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, I wish to restate the offer by my Government to the IAEA of the multi-purpose gamma irradiation facility, which is useful for both industrial and research applications, at the Sheda Science and Technology Complex in Abuja, to serve as a regional sterile insect breeder for the African continent and its neighbouring region. The facility has an innovative design with significantly enhanced versatility, and thus possesses the flexibility to irradiate a wide spectrum of products.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa16">Turning to the Agency's management and financing, Nigeria continues to underline the need for the IAEA to broaden its staff recruitment and disposition to encompass various regions of the world and underrepresented Member States, in a fair and balanced manner. We also urge that, as it is one of the largest United Nations specialized agencies, but has perhaps the lowest gender representation, the employment of women, especially from the developing countries, must be given priority consideration for the acquisition of knowledge, expertise, experience and capacity-building, which are invaluable and indispensable to developing countries' requirements.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa17">On financing, Nigeria notes that the IAEA General Conference, at its fiftieth regular session in September 2006, decided on a figure of $80 million for the Technical Cooperation Fund target for each year of the 2007-2008 biennium. Numerically speaking, this represents an increase over the target for 2005-2006, but in real terms it reflects the principle of zero growth, taking into account the increasing needs and requests of member States for technical cooperation assistance. We thus call for more resources to be made available to the Fund in a manner that will promote its assurance, predictability and sufficiency.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa18">Considering the magnitude of the challenges facing the IAEA, Nigeria takes the position that the time has come to enhance its funding, with a view to making greater resources available to it to carry out its very important activities in order to meet these challenges in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa19">The IAEA continues to face mounting challenges, perhaps the greatest of which is in the area of detection of proliferation of nuclear technology for weapons purposes. The international community must realistically grapple with this situation in order to strengthen international peace and security, to which all Member States are committed under the Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa20">Nigeria regards the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, with the IAEA safeguards system as an essential instrument for applying and ensuring compliance with the provisions of the safeguards system under the NPT. Nothing should be done to erode or weaken non-proliferation commitments under the Treaty, which we believe will strengthen confidence in the Treaty and enhance the attainment of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa21">Nigeria reiterates its position that, judging from the history of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, by failing to curb or stop their own vertical proliferation and the technical sophistication of their nuclear arsenals the nuclear Powers have inadvertently encouraged other States to proliferate horizontally. From one nuclear Power in 1945, we now have nine nuclear-weapon States, the latest dating from October this year. That represents consistently at least one or two States becoming nuclear-weapon States every decade over the past 61 years, with no end seemingly in sight. The time is ripe for credible action on reversing this trend through effective nuclear disarmament, including the conclusion of a legally binding agreement to extend negative security assurances against the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons to the developing States that voluntarily renounced the possession of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa22">The Nigerian delegation believes that the work of the IAEA would be greatly facilitated if there were a recommitment to genuine nuclear disarmament. The NPT ascribed asymmetrical obligations and responsibilities to nuclear and non-nuclear States parties alike, by emphasizing that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation should both be pursued vigorously, and not one at the expense of, or replacing, the other. As a first tangible demonstration of good faith in this regard, we call on the five nuclear Powers under the NPT to take the necessary action to ensure the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa23">In conclusion, Nigeria will continue to support the laudable role of the IAEA and global efforts to achieve its mandate under the Statute. We have thus again decided to co-sponsor the enabling <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.9.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.9</a>, introduced by the representative of Slovenia.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Phua Mei Pin</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">My delegation thanks the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for his comprehensive report. Singapore was recently a member of the IAEA Board of Governors. We fully appreciate and support the Agency and its work.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Given the world's growing energy needs, there appears to be something of a nuclear revival. Nuclear power is seen as an important alternative source of energy. We can expect an expansion in its use and the concomitant growth of nuclear power installations. The largest growth is likely to be in Asia.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Unfortunately, there are also risks of nuclear proliferation. For example, we remain deeply concerned about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's defiance of the will of the international community. We hope that that country will heed <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1718(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1718 (2006)</a> and abandon its nuclear weapons programme and return to the Six-Party Talks, without preconditions. We also urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), resume cooperation with the IAEA and accept full IAEA safeguards.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">These developments underline the increased relevance and importance of the IAEA. Let me state clearly that the IAEA has done a tremendous job since 1957. The award of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize to the Agency and to Mr. ElBaradei is testimony to that. But to deal with the challenges of the future the IAEA will have to strengthen its three pillars: nuclear safety, nuclear verification and nuclear technology.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The IAEA promotes high and consistent levels of nuclear safety. We recognize and support these efforts in providing clear benchmarks through instruments like peer reviews, assistance and review missions. The development and implementation of high standards in nuclear safety are key conditions to maintain as demand for nuclear energy grows.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">In tandem, transboundary emergency preparedness and response capabilities become important, given the grave consequences of a nuclear accident. Singapore sees the establishment of such response capabilities as a priority. We commend the setting up of the Incident and Emergency Centre by the IAEA last year. We also support greater regional cooperation in nuclear safety to complement and strengthen national and international efforts. This would contribute to confidence-building in the use of nuclear power.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">The promotion of nuclear safety goes hand in hand with ensuring nuclear security. Whether nuclear resources fuel growth or wreak unimaginable harm depends on who wields them. States must be vigilant in protecting nuclear materials and installations from falling into the wrong hands, through national efforts and international cooperation. Singapore is committed to supporting efforts to combat terrorism in all forms and at all levels.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">We support the full and effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1540(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)</a> to step up domestic controls and international cooperation against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Singapore will expand its strategic goods control list to take in the full lists of items controlled by the four multilateral export control regimes: the Nuclear Suppliers Group; the Wassenaar Arrangement; the Australia Group; and the Missile Technology Control Regime. The expanded list will take effect from January 2008.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">The spread in the use of nuclear power brings with it greater risks of nuclear proliferation. The IAEA must ensure that States exercise their right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in compliance with their non-proliferation obligations under articles I, II and III of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). There must also be full and transparent implementation of the IAEA's safeguards system. Its verification regime must remain central in providing safeguard assurances. It is also crucial that the safeguard regime be able to respond to new challenges effectively and in a timely manner.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">Singapore is working to put in place the necessary instruments required to ratify our additional protocol and to modify our small quantities protocol. To better ensure non-diversion of nuclear material, we believe in the universalization of the comprehensive safeguards agreement and the additional protocol. We urge other IAEA member States to sign on to these commitments as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa11">The proliferation risks entailed by sensitive aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle have gained international attention. It is imperative to find a balanced approach to prevent clandestine proliferation activities, while upholding the rights of States to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear power. Member States have tabled several proposals, and Mr. ElBaradei has also suggested a multinational approach to the nuclear fuel cycle. These proposals merit serious consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa12">Singapore supports the IAEA's activities to bring socio-economic benefits to developing countries through nuclear application. These activities encompass areas such as medical diagnoses and treatment; industrial applications; animal production and health; food quality and safety; and the management of water resources. They contribute to the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa13">Singapore also remains committed to supporting the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Programme. We are pleased with the expansion of the Programme, and we commend the Agency for establishing partnerships with international and regional development organizations. We support regional activities organized under the Regional Cooperative Agreement for the Asia Pacific region. We remain committed to continuing our bilateral cooperation with the IAEA through our Memorandum of Understanding for outreach efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa14">The IAEA has had a challenging year. Yet the Director General and his staff have risen to the task, and we commend them. Singapore will also do its share, nationally and in cooperation with the international community.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kryzhanivskyi</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Ukraine aligns itself with the statement made by the representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union and associated countries. Therefore, I shall limit my remarks to a few issues of particular interest to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">At the beginning, on behalf of the Government of Ukraine, I congratulate the new member States of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the Republic of Malawi, the Republic of Mozambique, the Republic of Palau and the Republic of Montenegro -- and wish them every success in their activities within the Agency. The enlargement of IAEA membership is further evidence of the Agency's growing prestige.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">In the course of the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the IAEA, I have the privilege to speak on behalf of Ukraine, a State in which the peaceful use of nuclear energy is one of the determining conditions of sustainable development of the national economy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Taking into account the rising prices of hydrocarbon raw materials, nuclear energy remains an important component of ensuring our energy independence in the medium and long term, as stated in Ukraine's energy strategy for the period to 2030. Ukraine possesses enough supplies of uranium, which is an argument for the extensive use of nuclear energy. Moreover, proven deposits of uranium ore in Ukraine might be used for the needs of other countries as well. That is why we are open to international cooperation in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">In the context of the safe use of nuclear energy, demonstrating the highest level of reactor reliability and management of waste nuclear fuel and radioactive waste are of the highest priority for Ukraine's State bodies. This fully corresponds to the medium-term strategy of the Agency, whose tasks we completely share. In particular, Ukraine takes part in IAEA activities in the area of fuel cycle and new safe-reactor developments, in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum. Last year, Ukraine joined the international project on innovative nuclear reactors. Ukraine, having great potential in the sphere of nuclear technologies, supports the Agency's efforts aimed at conservation of nuclear knowledge and sustainable support for human knowledge for national programmes of nuclear energy development. We also actively support the Agency's activities to strengthen cooperation in nuclear science, especially those connected to radiation biology and radiation medicine.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">We welcome the Agency's activities aimed at raising nuclear security. Currently, Ukrainian nuclear power plants, including those for research, fully meet the demands of domestic and international standards in this sphere. Ukraine continues to improve relevant legislation and strengthen the capability of regulatory authorities. In this connection, we would like to mention such an important part of the Agency's activities as development of guidance and recommendations, which are taken into account when creating national legislation all over the world.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">An important part of the IAEA's activities is the work on assurance of radiation security and on radioactive waste management. This year, our national strategy foresees particularly solving the problems of radioactive waste management during decommissioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and conversion of the shelter object into an ecologically safe system. All those matters take a great portion of the State budget, and the final solution of this task cannot be performed without international aid.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">I take this opportunity to call upon the Governments of the States members of the IAEA, which are donors to relevant funds, to make additional efforts aimed at early solving of all the problems connected with the creation in Ukraine of facilities for nuclear-waste processing and building storage for spent nuclear fuel and new confinements.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">Notwithstanding the expiration of the mandate of the Chernobyl Forum, which acted within the United Nations framework, we hope that the Agency will continue to pay due attention to issues connected with the mitigation of the Chernobyl disaster. We are particularly grateful to the IAEA for taking an active part in preparation for the international conference, "Twenty Year After Chernobyl Accident -- Future Outlook", which was held in April this year in Ukraine.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">Ukraine is concerned about the new threats posed by nuclear terrorism, which have risen recently in the world. In this context, we support the aim and objectives of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, as well as other international and regional programmes in this area. That is why we highly appreciate the Agency's activities in strengthening nuclear and radioactive materials management and preventing their illegal circulation, and we advocate strengthening the regime for physical protection of nuclear materials.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">Regarding the basic principles of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, Ukraine created and manages the State system for registration and control of physical protection of the sources of ionizing irradiation. Relevant legislation on export-import controls has also been improved.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa12">Ukraine welcomes the IAEA's efforts to improve the safeguards system's effectiveness. An important element of strengthening the non-proliferation regime is application of the additional protocol -- which Ukraine ratified last year -- to the safeguards agreement with the IAEA in connection with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We are grateful to the Agency for the practical assistance given during our preparation of the initial declaration under the protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa13">Ukraine especially appreciates the results of the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme, which demonstrates the Agency's ability to react adequately and quickly to its member States' demands. In this regard, we draw attention to the fruitful work of the Department of Technical Cooperation and its European Section.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa14">In conclusion, I endorse the words of support for the IAEA report and state once again our appreciation of the activities of the Director General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei. We are also grateful to the secretariat for strengthening international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Ukraine will continue to take part in the Agency's activities in order to help achieve its important mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa15">Our delegation, of course, fully supports the draft resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibowo</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">The delegation of Indonesia expresses its sincere appreciation to Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his presentation of the report of the IAEA for 2005. The report provides a broad picture of all the activities and important work that the Agency has undertaken in the course of that year.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">My delegation commends the excellent work of the Agency in fulfilling its mandate, particularly its efforts to ensure that the benefits of nuclear technology are shared globally for economic and social development through the harnessing of nuclear technology for a myriad of peaceful applications, such as in the areas of health, food and agriculture, water resources management, and environmental protection.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">In the year of its fiftieth anniversary, we can see that, despite the challenges and difficulties experienced in the last 50 years, the IAEA has carried out significant work and realized remarkable achievements. The excellent work undertaken in the preservation and expansion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was recognized through the award of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize to the IAEA and its Director General.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Indonesia lauds the endeavours of the IAEA, in particular its Technical Cooperation Programme, now covering areas ranging from power generation to a diverse array of industrial, environmental, medical and agricultural applications. Indonesia has been working closely with the IAEA for many years, and continues to support the Programme as an important component of the Agency's activities.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Nuclear technology has been successfully used in Indonesia to cultivate biofuel plants, such as Jatropha curcas L. for bio-diesel and sweet sorghum for bio-ethanol. This achievement is in line with the Indonesian Green Energy Action Plan, recently formulated to develop alternative sources of energy, especially in the transportation and power generation sectors.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">In the areas of food and agriculture, we note that over 25 new and improved varieties of staple food crops were released in 2005. In this context, high-quality rice mutant varieties have been planted in Indonesia in an area of over 0.4 million hectares. It is expected that by the end of this year the planted area will be expanded to 1 million hectares.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">We have also benefited from training and scientific visits, as well as international technical meetings and seminars conducted under the Agency's Technical Cooperation Programme. In addition, we welcome the step taken by the Agency in increasing the effectiveness of the Programme in recent years, by shifting from a technology-driven approach to a needs-driven approach focused on the achievement of tangible socio-economic benefits in member States. We also concur with the current strategy highlighting three elements essential for the successful delivery of the Programme -- strong Government commitment, high quality of technical cooperation projects and adequate funding.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">In this connection, it is important to stress that the IAEA must maintain sufficient, predictable and assured funds for technical cooperation. We believe that this objective can only be achieved through a genuine commitment by all member States, particularly the developed countries, in providing greater financial support. My delegation expresses its gratitude to those member States of the Agency that have contributed to the Technical Cooperation Fund. Their continued support and commitment will undoubtedly bring us closer to the attainment of the Programme's objectives through the value of the Fund decided for 2007-2008.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">Furthermore, as to the Programme and the use of its Fund as a whole, we stress that careful consideration should be given to maintaining an adequate balance between the Agency's various statutory activities and the need to promote technical cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">The annual report stresses the importance of the Agency's activities to improving nuclear security for member States, including through increasing awareness and their ability to control and protect nuclear and other radioactive materials, nuclear installations and transport from terrorism and other illegal activities. In this regard, Indonesia has been strongly supportive of the Agency's nuclear security activities, in particular its assistance to the member States in improving nuclear security. In the domain of nuclear safety, my delegation commends the Agency's measures to strengthen its role of enhancing nuclear, radiation and transport safety and waste management, through the development of nuclear safety standards.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">As mentioned in the annual report, the Agency conducted a number of missions in Indonesia through its Integrated Safety Assessment of Research Reactors service. We thank the Agency for the implementation of project INS-9-022, "Inspection Procedures and Methods for Assessing Reactor Tank Liners", which has helped Indonesia to further improve the operational safety and security of its three research reactors. Indonesia has successfully established an information system on the licensing and inspection of radiation facilities and radioactive sources. With regard to emergency situations, after conducting the field exercise on the radiation dispersal device in Jakarta Province, in cooperation with the Agency, we have also successfully conducted the Asia and Pacific regional training course "Practical Response to a Radiological Emergency Preparedness: First Responder".</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa12">As the report rightly observes, 2005 was a year of increased expectations for nuclear energy, driven by, among other things, the growing need for energy around the world, coupled with rising oil and natural gas prices. Over the past few years we have witnessed a considerable change in attitudes towards nuclear energy. Nuclear power continues to account for a significant share of world electricity generation, contributing substantially to world economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa13">Indonesia believes that nuclear energy as an energy option has the potential to have a major socio-economic impact on Member States, especially those of the developing world. With that in mind, Indonesia is embarking on its nuclear energy programme, and the construction of nuclear power plants is under way, with a view to their being operational in 2016. To this end, Indonesia is in the process of establishing Government regulations on the licensing of nuclear reactors, soon to be signed by the President.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa14">Presidential Decree No. 5 for 2006 concerning Indonesia's national energy policy, covering nuclear power plant activities, was enacted earlier this year to enable their timely construction. In this connection, we would like to record our gratitude to the Agency for providing us with three nuclear-power-related technical cooperation projects, which hopefully will be further enhanced in the next technical cooperation cycle, especially in an effort to enhance the capability of our regulatory authority to develop standard specifications and qualification of manpower to supervise and operate the nuclear power plants.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa15">Remarkable progress has been achieved over the years in defining and implementing the IAEA safeguards system. Indonesia has consistently supported the IAEA's efforts to strengthen its safeguards system, which is a fundamental component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. For its part, Indonesia has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol with the Agency, and it is particularly pleased that the IAEA has drawn a positive conclusion with regard to nuclear material and activities in Indonesia. I also reaffirm our commitment to the additional protocol, as it constitutes the centrepiece of the Agency's response in strengthening and improving the effectiveness of the safeguards system.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa16">Given the urgent and serious challenges we face in preserving international peace and security related to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, much remains to be done. We share the disappointment at the lack of progress at the 2005 NPT Review Conference and at the omission of a nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament section from the 2005 World Summit Outcome. For Indonesia, the NPT remains the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. We look forward to the commencement of a new cycle in the review process of the NPT next year.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa17">In the preparations for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, there is an urgent need to strengthen the integrity of the NPT. A successful outcome of the Review Conference is vital for the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and nuclear disarmament for the purposes of maintaining international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa18">The past two years have proved challenging for the IAEA with respect to safeguards and verification. In fact, some issues have preoccupied the Agency. We note with appreciation that it has maintained its professionalism in dealing with all the verification challenges, and thereby has strengthened its credibility and integrity.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa19">The Iranian nuclear issue will continue to capture our attention, and it deserves our resolute action. In view of the serious implications of this issue, wisdom, statesmanship and the need to preserve peace and security in the region should be given due consideration. We believe that diplomacy, negotiations and other peaceful means are the best and most suitable approaches in dealing with this issue. We strongly support the Director General in continuing and completing his work on the issue. At the same time, we urge Iran to continue to cooperate fully and actively with the Director General in his efforts to resolve this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa20">Israel's nuclear capabilities and threat, and the nuclear adventures of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, are other issues of grave concern for us, as they pose serious threats to regional peace and security. While the threat of nuclear weapons has subsided in other regions, we may be exposed to the danger of such weapons in West and East Asia. The international community should therefore give high priority to dealing with these two dangerous problems.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa21">In this regard, the return of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the NPT, and the accession of Israel to the Treaty, as well as the placement of their nuclear programmes under IAEA safeguards, are the most urgent and critical steps towards reducing tension and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa22">In this connection, we are very disappointed by the continued Israeli refusal to cooperate with the Director General in implementing the General Conference resolutions regarding the application of full-scope Agency safeguards in the Middle East, as that does not help to create the conditions for lasting peace and security, and will certainly deepen suspicion of its motives and policies.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa23">Indonesia supports and lauds the efforts of the Agency in enhancing nuclear safety and security, as well as safeguards and verification in ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We share the growing concern over the challenges on those issues, and we have noted several initiatives and proposals put forward in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa24">We believe, however, that proliferation concerns and all safeguards issues are best addressed through multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory agreements under the auspices of the IAEA. We could not agree more that non-proliferation control arrangements should be transparent and open to participation by all States, and should ensure that they do not impose restrictions on the access to material, equipment and the development of nuclear technology and know-how for peaceful purposes required by Member States, particularly developing countries, for their continued development. In this regard, the proposal of the Group of Experts entrusted by the Director General in 2005 with exploring the possibility of developing a region-based multinational facility has its own merit and deserves further consideration by member States in addressing their prevailing concern regarding assurances of supply and non-proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa25">Indonesia believes that the inalienable right of all States parties to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, in accordance with article IV of the NPT, constitutes one of the fundamental objectives of the Treaty, and that nothing in the Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all parties to it to develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without discrimination. We reiterate that each country's choices and decisions in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy should be respected, without jeopardizing international agreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa26">My delegation reaffirms its continued support for the efforts of the IAEA and the Director General in the advancement of the uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and in the furtherance of the non-proliferation regime, through its strengthened safeguards system. We also believe that the agenda and concerns over international peace and security, as well as nuclear proliferation, should not overshadow the great challenges we face in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy for sustainable socio-economic development.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martirosyan</span> <span class="nation">Armenia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I join others in thanking Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei for his presentation of the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">This year has been truly fraught with challenges in the areas of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As a neighbouring country, we are hopeful that the international community will be able to find a resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy and dialogue. We were very concerned about the nuclear test conducted by North Korea and hope that the international community's reaction to that problem will be demonstrative of its resolve not to allow the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Armenia attaches great importance to nuclear energy in both the economic and security aspects. Its cooperation with the IAEA to ensure the uninterrupted and safe operation of the Armenian nuclear power plant has been remarkable.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">In December 2005, a special technical meeting to coordinate international assistance to the Armenian nuclear power plant was organized by the Agency's Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, with the participation of donor countries. It presented a comprehensive summary of the analysis of different aspects related to the Armenian power plant: design, seismic and operational safety issues, and regulatory issues, as well as the relationship between IAEA Technical Documents safety issues and the programme to upgrade the Armenian nuclear power plant.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">In its power plant programme, Armenia made commitments to implementing a number of additional measures aimed at upgrading the safety of the nuclear power plant. The sum of $1.8 million was allocated by the Government of Armenia to that end, and the measures will be carried out in the fall of this year, when the Metsamor nuclear power plant will undergo an annual outage and refuelling. A technical meeting for the coordination of international assistance will follow to assess the measures taken and come up with additional recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">Armenia pays great attention to the protection of radioactive sources. In 2006, an inventory of existing radioactive sources was made and an investigation of orphan sources is currently under way. This year, Armenia assumed the chairmanship of the WWER Regulators Forum and hosted the thirteenth annual meeting in Yerevan in June. The Forum welcomed three new member States -- China, India and Iran -- and made its contribution to further improving regulators' activities, making them more efficient and transparent.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">The sustainability of energy sources is a major issue for my country. Armenia is very interested in the International Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles project, which drafts new standards for new nuclear stations, the safety and security of the fuel cycle, ecological aspects and non-proliferation issues. The project is of special importance to those countries planning to develop their nuclear energy sector. In that respect, I would like to underline that a feasibility study for nuclear energy development in Armenia was approved by Director General ElBaradei for the next biennium. The project will make an analysis of the expenditures for the construction of new nuclear reactors based on the existing infrastructure and the expertise of the current staff of the Metsamor nuclear power plant. Meanwhile, in collaboration with the European Union and under the Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States and Georgia programme for 2006-2007, the Armenian Government is working on a project that will set the timetable and expenditures for the decommissioning of unit 2 of the nuclear power plant.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">The Armenian Government's progress in ensuring the safe and secure operation of the Armenian nuclear power plant would have been very difficult, and in certain instances almost impossible, without the support and assistance of our partners and donors. In that respect, I would like to express my gratitude to the Governments of the United States, the Russian Federation, France, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Slovakia for their financial and professional support.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tulbure</span> <span class="nation">Moldova</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for his comprehensive report.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">The Republic of Moldova aligns itself with the European Union statement, but I would like to highlight some additional subjects related to my country.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Today, humanity is entering an era of rapid scientific and technological development. As related to global economic expenditures, the need for energy sustainability and new technologies is becoming increasingly pressing. In that context, more and more countries have begun to review the role of nuclear technologies in their economic development. The IAEA has an important mission to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear technologies. Convinced that this policy will continue, the IAEA provides as much assistance as possible to the developing countries via technical cooperation, expert consultancy and personnel training.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Special attention is paid in our country to the development and adoption of our own legislative framework to harmonize it with European Union standards. That will guarantee the accomplishment of those objectives in the nuclear field as well. The Republic of Moldova is deeply attached to the peaceful uses of nuclear technologies. That is reflected in a major political option taken by our country that is clearly outlined in the recently adopted national law concerning the safe implementation of nuclear activities and those involving ionizing radiation sources.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">All countries that go through the transition to a market economy face a decline or stagnation in their economic development. Our country was no exception. Moldova is facing a very complicated situation of scarce energy resources. Almost all our energy is imported from Ukraine and Russia and prices continue to rise, affecting our economy. Thus, the Government's goal is to find alternative energy sources, both renewable and nuclear. The IAEA could take the following actions to provide technical assistance or finance projects in those fields in developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">Moldova has signed a new Country Programme Framework, reflecting our major interests related to the Agency. In the Framework, the following priority areas of cooperation were identified: nuclear equipment in human health, radiation processing, radiation safety, emergency preparedness and radioactive waste management. It is necessary to underline that, within the framework of our cooperation assistance projects, around $3 million have been provided through the IAEA. For the next biennial cycle, three national projects have been submitted. Two are related to the implementation of proton linear accelerator technology in cancer treatment and to the establishment of new industrial sectors based on radiation processing technology. The third national project is related to the upgrading of radiation monitoring capability.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">I would like to express our gratitude to the IAEA and the United States Government for their support regarding the safety of radioactive sources. Those activities were undertaken successfully, and the storage of sources is in keeping with international standards.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">We will be very grateful to our partners for their assistance in the implementation of the national project to establish an industrial radiation processing centre. This project will have a considerable impact on the development of such branches of the economy as pharmaceuticals, medicine, the food industry and the sciences.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">We are aware of the importance of nuclear security and will pursue further cooperation with the IAEA Department of Safeguards concerning the implementation of the respective international norms and practices. In this context, our Government has presented an official letter to the Agency regarding our readiness to sign the additional protocol.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">The IAEA has been playing an indispensable role in the peaceful use of nuclear technologies and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That is why it has become one of the most dynamic international organizations. I reiterate the support of our Government for the IAEA's activities.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">Moldova co-sponsored the draft resolution introduced by the representative of Slovenia and will vote in favour of it.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Acting President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">We shall now proceed to consider <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.9.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.9</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">I call on the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who wishes to speak in explanation of vote before the voting. I remind delegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sin Song Chol</span> <span class="nation">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would like to clarify its position on the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">First, it is totally unreasonable for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to mention the so-called nuclear issue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its report. We would like to draw attention to the fact that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is neither a member of the IAEA nor a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">Secondly, the IAEA addresses the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a biased manner. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a political and military issue between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, which cannot be dealt with by the IAEA.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is an outcome of the hostile United States policy towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. For more than half a century the United States has made nuclear threats to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In particular, President Bush, immediately after assuming power, designated the Democratic People's Republic of Korea part of an "axis of evil" and a target of the United States nuclear pre-emptive strike.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">Moreover, as soon as the 19 September Beijing Joint Statement was made public the United States imposed financial sanctions upon the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and stepped up its pressure from every angle. In addition, the United States hindered the implementation of the Joint Statement by every means, with such threats and blackmail as large-scale military exercises targeting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">The possession of nuclear weapons and nuclear testing by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is actually attributable to the United States nuclear threats, sanctions and blockade against my country.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">It is important to evaluate exactly how the IAEA has dealt with the nuclear issue. This matter has emerged as a political and military issue between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is a very small country, and the United States, which is a pretend super-Power, with both still technically at war. The IAEA, under United States instructions, has addressed the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula with prejudice and double standards, abandoning its impartiality, which must be its lifeline as an international organization.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the ultimate goal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, whose will to denuclearize the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiations, to which it committed itself in the 19 September Joint Statement, remains unchanged. But it should be clearly understood that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula cannot be realized through the unilateral abandonment by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of its nuclear programme, and that it can be realized only when the United States also implements its own obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">My delegation stresses that the Beijing Joint Statement stipulates the obligations of not only the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also the United States and South Korea, which are parties directly concerned in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea opposes the draft resolution, since it is intended to mislead about the substance of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and does not help to solve the problem at all.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">My delegation voted in favour of the draft resolution, on the basis of its belief in the importance of the IAEA in monitoring nuclear non-proliferation and guaranteeing the right of Member States, large and small, to the peaceful uses of atomic energy.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">Yet my delegation would like to place on record its regret and disappointment at the positions taken by many States in the IAEA General Conference during its fiftieth session on the item concerning the Israeli nuclear capacity and the Israeli nuclear threat. Those positions led to a postponement of the discussion of the item until next year, while major international pressures are being brought to bear on other States that are exercising their sovereign right to acquire nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">This item has been on the agenda of the General Conference for more than a decade, during which resolutions in favour of establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East have accumulated. Those resolutions have called on Israel to renounce its nuclear option and place its nuclear installations under international inspection and the safeguards agreement, and to seek to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone, which has no room for policies of nuclear terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">Our disappointment is also caused by the failure of the international community to send a clear message to Israel affirming its sincere will and vigorous efforts to implement the principle of nuclear non-proliferation, rather than continue to follow the policy of nuclear hypocrisy pursued by some States, which will only lead to further risk to international peace and security. My delegation stresses that silencing the voice of right this time, in the face of the Israeli nuclear threat and risk in the Middle East region, through aborting the draft resolution will not be repeated ad infinitum. The day will come when the voice of right will be heard.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">The voting in the First Committee on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/AC.1-61-L.2.pdf" class="nolink">A/C.1/61/L.2</a>, "The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East", is sure evidence of the invalidity of the positions of those States that have hindered the discussion of the aforementioned item in the IAEA General Conference, especially since the seventh preambular paragraph of that draft resolution, adopted by the First Committee on 23 October 2006 with 151 votes in favour, expresses concern at the continued existence in the Middle East of unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, and since the eighth preambular paragraph notes that Israel remains the only State in the Middle East that has not yet become party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, operative paragraphs 2 and 3 reaffirm the importance of Israel's accession to the Treaty without further delay and placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards, and call upon Israel not to develop, produce, test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons, but rather to renounce their possession as an important confidence-building measure among all States of the region and as a step towards enhancing peace and security.</p>
