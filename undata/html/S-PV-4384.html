<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Granovsky</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">The Russian delegation is satisfied with the way in which the Government of the Republic of the Sudan has met the demands of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1054(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1054 (1996)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1070(1996).pdf" class="pdf">1070 (1996)</a>. We also note the official statements in support of the lifting of the anti-Sudan sanctions on the part of the Organization of African Unity, the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of Arab States, which all indicate that Sudan has fully met all of the demands that were made on it.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">It is important that the Council objectively assess the specific steps taken by the Government of Sudan to remove the grounds that had led to the introduction of sanctions. The Russian Federation views positively the fact that Egypt and Ethiopia, which had once insisted on imposing sanctions against Sudan, have now officially withdrawn their claims against it and, in principle, support the request of its Government for lifting the sanctions regime.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Pursuant to the demands of the Security Council, Sudan has now completed its accession to all international anti-terrorist conventions, including relevant inter-Arab and inter-African agreements. Sudan's conduct in good faith on this matter has created conditions for the gradual normalization of its relations with neighbouring States and in the region as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">We believe that the specific steps taken by the Government of the Republic of the Sudan to meet the demands in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1054(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1054 (1996)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1070(1996).pdf" class="pdf">1070 (1996)</a>, and also the positive reaction to this by the international community, are sufficient grounds for the Council's now taking a decision to lift sanctions against the Republic of the Sudan.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The United States Government believes that the Government of Sudan has taken substantial steps to meet the specific demands of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1054(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1054 (1996)</a>. We note with concern, however, that the suspects wanted in connection with the 1995 assassination attempt on President Mubarak in Addis Ababa were not turned over to the appropriate authorities. This was not satisfactory.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">However, we believe, as do the Governments of Egypt and Ethiopia, that they are no longer in Sudan. In this regard, we take very seriously the letters sent to the Council by the Governments of Egypt and Ethiopia -- the victims of the incident that led to the Security Council actions on Sudan -- calling for a lifting of Council sanctions anyway. We strongly urge the authorities of all States to continue the effort to bring these suspects to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">Sudan has recently apprehended extremists within that country whose activities may have contributed to international terrorism. Sudan is also engaged in serious discussions with my Government about ways to combat terrorism. We welcome those steps and expect this cooperation to continue. We expect the Government of Sudan to demonstrate a full commitment to the fight against international terrorism by taking every step to expel terrorists and deny them safe haven.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">The United States also has continuing concerns about the enormous suffering of the Sudanese people. The civil war in the Sudan has lasted some 18 years and has caused immense human misery. Two million people have died; there have been massive displacements of civilians; human rights continue to be abused; and human beings there continue to be treated as slaves.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">My Government will continue to demand that the Government of Sudan address these issues while we work to build greater cooperation in the international fight against terrorism. The President named a truly distinguished American, Senator John Danforth, to engage Sudan on these and other issues. In light of these considerations, the United States has abstained on this resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">The United Kingdom very much welcomes the fact that the Government of Sudan has complied as far as practicable with the conditions for lift in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1054(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1054 (1996)</a>. Today's resolution sends out a clear signal that the Council stands ready to act once it has determined that a country has complied with the demands set out in a resolution. Other States that currently support terrorism should take note and be led by the example which Sudan has set.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">We particularly welcome Sudan's recent cooperation with the international community against terrorism, even before the terrible events of 11 September. The fact that Sudan has ratified the relevant conventions on terrorism is a clear signal of that Government's intent. The United Kingdom remains actively interested in the pursuit of a just and lasting peace agreement, which will benefit all the people of Sudan. The lifting of these sanctions will allow the intensification of diplomatic activity to this end. We look forward to the day when the Security Council's discussions of Sudan can focus on international support for such a peace settlement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ryan</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">The Irish Government has taken note of and welcomes the steps taken by the Government of Sudan to comply with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1054(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolutions 1054 (1996)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1070(1996).pdf" class="pdf">1070 (1996)</a>. As the requirements for lifting the sanctions have now been met, my Government agrees with the terms of the resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">While the Security Council is today acknowledging that the very specific requirements for the lifting of the sanctions have been met, and for that reason the sanctions are being lifted, the Irish Government remains deeply concerned at the wider political, humanitarian and human rights situation in the Sudan. We call on the Government of the Sudan to cease immediately any targeting of the civilian population and to allow the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need. We urge the Government of the Sudan to engage urgently in serious negotiations, through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development process, on a just and lasting political settlement to the conflict in the Sudan and to negotiate a comprehensive ceasefire.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">I call on the Permanent Representative of the Sudan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Erwa</span> <span class="nation">Sudan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">It is an honour at the outset to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your impressive performance in presiding over the deliberations of the Security Council during the month of September. I also wish to congratulate your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of Colombia, on his excellent stewardship of the Council during the past month.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">I wish to welcome the Secretary-General. We are very pleased at his presence at this important meeting, at which an issue that affects my country is being debated.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">I address the Council following its adoption of the resolution to lift sanctions against the Sudan. This resolution has come as the fruit of enormous efforts undertaken by the Sudan in order to cooperate with the international community, as represented by the Security Council, on the basis of the firm tenets of the Sudan's foreign policy, which is anchored in our commitment to promote conditions of international peace and security, the primary objective of this Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">I wish to take this opportunity to thank all members of the Security Council who have appreciated my country's seriousness and good faith in putting an end to the factors that led to the imposition of sanctions against my country in 1996. Special thanks go to the Non-Aligned Movement caucus in the Council, which sponsored this resolution on behalf of the larger membership of the Non-Aligned Movement. I also wish to thank the permanent members of the Council, who have appreciated my country's wisdom and positive honouring of its commitment to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">More than one year has elapsed since the question of lifting the sanctions against the Sudan was last debated in the Security Council. In fact, that happened during your previous presidency of the Council, Sir. During this period many bilateral dialogues were undertaken between the Sudan and some members of the Security Council. Despite the fact that such dialogues delayed the adoption of this resolution for some time, we can safely say that they were constructive and useful and were characterized by constructive and professional diplomatic work. We believe that this will lay a solid foundation for wider areas of cooperation in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">In closing, I would like to take this historic opportunity to assure the Council, on behalf of the Government and the people of my country, that the resolution just adopted represents a strong impetus for my country to proceed forward and to cooperate in efforts to eliminate terrorism, and to engage in the mainstream work of the international community and its organs, foremost of which is the Security Council, in order to eliminate international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with a view to creating a world where justice, peace, security and stability reign supreme.</p>
