	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01"> The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the communiqué issued by the Government of Angola on 13 March 2002 (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-270.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/270</a>) as a positive, constructive and forward-looking approach to ending the conflict and resuming the process of national reconciliation and calls upon the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) to show that it shares a similar position, with the aim of achieving national reconciliation including through a general ceasefire in Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council urges UNITA to recognize the historic nature of this opportunity to end the conflict with dignity, to give a clear, positive response to the Government's offer of peace, to implement fully the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex), including by disavowing the use of arms and demilitarizing completely, and to re-enter political life to pursue its ideals as an important contributor to the process of national reconciliation towards a fully democratic Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council recognizes the positive initiatives of the Government of Angola in this process. It also recognizes the vital role to be played by a peaceful UNITA and stresses the importance of the role of other political parties and civil society, including the churches, all supported by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council expects that the Government of Angola will fulfil its commitments as rapidly as circumstances permit, and notes that the response of the international community, including the provision of assistance, with the exception of humanitarian assistance, would be positively encouraged by the Government's efforts and actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council calls on the Government of Angola to ensure further the transparency and credibility of the peace process, including by cooperating with the United Nations, in the first phase and beyond. The Council looks forward to discussions between the Under-Secretary-General/Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa and the Government of Angola to clarify the role of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council stresses the active role that the United Nations is expected to play in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, in close cooperation with the Government of Angola, and notes the need to renew, and possibly redefine, the mandate of the United Nations Office in Angola (UNOA) by 15 April 2002, taking into account recent developments in Angola, in consultation with the Government of Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council declares its support for the full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and its willingness to work with all parties in this endeavour, and stresses the importance of the re-commencement of the Joint Commission as soon as UNITA is ready to name its members. It calls upon the Government to facilitate UNITA retaking its place on the Commission, while noting that it might be necessary for the parties to build upon the Lusaka Protocol, by common agreement, as appropriate to current circumstances without altering the fundamental nature and principles of the accord.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council stands ready to consider appropriate and specific exemptions from and amendments to the measures imposed by paragraph 4 (a) of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1127(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1127 (1997)</a> of 28 August 1997 in consultation with the Government of Angola and with a view to facilitating the peace negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council welcomes the statement of the Government of Angola on facilitation of the political reorganization of UNITA and the choice of their leadership in complete freedom, in order to have a legitimate interlocutor for national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council underlines that the legitimacy of the peace process depends upon a genuine role for, and full participation of, political parties and civil society without interference, as well as flexibility in approaching questions of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council expresses its concern that the grave humanitarian situation, especially for internally displaced persons, continues to deteriorate, and calls upon the Government of Angola to accelerate full and immediate access to all those in need of humanitarian assistance. It welcomes the decision by the Government of Angola to include humanitarian assistance in its plans to extend territorial administration throughout Angola, and expects the Government of Angola to cooperate fully, through an agreed coordinating mechanism, with the international donors in developing swiftly an appropriate and effective humanitarian response, including demining activities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"The Security Council invites the Government of Angola to brief the Council at the earliest opportunity on the peace process in all its aspects, as well as national reconciliation and the humanitarian situation."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-7.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/7</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">The Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
