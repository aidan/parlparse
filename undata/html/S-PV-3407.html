	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, contained in documents <a href="../pdf/S-1994-818.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/818</a> and Add.1.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Henze</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me to see you, Sir, presiding over the Security Council. Owing to your experience and leadership, the Council has been able to complete its work on the draft resolution before it in what we realize is a very short period of time.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">As a member of the group of &quot;Friends of Georgia&quot;, Germany has been closely involved in the discussions that have resulted in the draft resolution before the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">If much time has passed since the Council first established the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) in August 1993, this has not been because of a lack of effort on the part of the Secretary-General or the Security Council. On the contrary, the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy have spared no effort towards achieving progress in the political negotiations and in the talks on a United Nations peace-keeping role. The Security Council, for its part, has played an active role. Over time, it has considered a number of different options. It has repeatedly stressed its willingness to take action.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Over the past months, there have also been intensive deliberations within the group of &quot;Friends of Georgia&quot;. In considering the issues involved, Germany has maintained close contact with the Georgian Government. In addition, we have sought the views of other interested Member States and taken their ideas into account. It was clear from the outset that a decision by the Security Council on the situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, would likely have repercussions for deliberations in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). As a member State of both the United Nations and the CSCE, Germany felt that it was a matter of consistency to apply the same standards in both forums. We are grateful that this principle has been recognized in the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">Germany, of course, fully supports the draft resolution before the Council today. Indeed, it has co-- sponsored the draft resolution together with the other members of the Friends group.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The draft resolution reflects the important contribution of the Russian Federation in providing a peace-keeping force in Georgia. Germany welcomes the willingness of the Russian Federation to undertake this difficult task. The peace-keeping force has been established at the request of the parties. As the draft resolution notes, it will operate in accordance with the established principles and practices of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">In its efforts to implement the 14 May Agreement, the peace-keeping force will cooperate closely with a significantly enlarged UNOMIG. According to all accounts, the experience in this regard has been entirely positive so far. It is in this spirit of cooperation that UNOMIG's observer role <i>vis-a-vis </i>the peace-keeping force must be seen. This role is itself a reflection of the trust that the Security Council is placing in the Russian Federation and the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">In this context, I would like to note that six German soldiers are currently serving with UNOMIG. In response to a request of the Secretary-General, the Federal Government has recently decided to contribute additional personnel. Germany fully realizes that UNOMIG is operating under difficult conditions. We highly appreciate the performance of the soldiers and civilians participating in this mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">In closing, let me underline the importance Germany attaches to an accelerated return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes. This goal can be achieved fully only if both parties remain committed to a comprehensive and early settlement of the conflict based upon the principles set out in the Council's previous resolutions. We look forward to the Secretary-General's report in three months' time. The report will provide an opportunity for us all to assess the performance of this new joint deployment and to make adjustments, if necessary.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Albright</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">This draft resolution deals with a new and significant set of circumstances. For the first time, we have established a relationship between a United Nations observer mission and a peace-keeping force within a sovereign State of the former Soviet Union.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">We have moved firmly, if cautiously, but above all positively. We have affirmed that the experience and concern of the United Nations and the efforts and energies of the Russian Federation and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States which may take part in the peace-keeping operation should be focused on assisting in the maintenance of the cease-fire, in the safe return of the over 300,000 refugees to their homes, and in facilitating a political settlement between the peoples of Abkhazia and the rest of the Republic of Georgia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">We have reaffirmed the Council's commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia. We have reaffirmed the primacy of the principles of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">This draft resolution helps to advance these objectives and principles. It provides a detailed framework for the operation of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) and sets out the Council's expectations for UNOMIG's relationship to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peace-keeping force. It speaks forcefully about the ultimate political objective as well as the humanitarian principles that must accompany this objective.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">It is demanding in its expectations of the performance of UNOMIG, of the peace-keeping forces and of the parties to the conflict. It is not a blank check. It has a six-month mandate, and renewal will be subject to Council review. It is hard-headed in its insistence on accurate information that can be provided only by a UNOMIG that is free to move, observe and report. But it also demonstrates the international community's willingness to assist in resolving the region's problems and allows for the possibility of more extensive United Nations involvement in the process in Georgia, should circumstances warrant.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">The parties to the conflict have consented to, even called for, the assistance of the United Nations and of the peace-keeping force. Chairman Shevardnadze has written to President Clinton on this subject, urging him to support this peace-keeping effort in order to assist the repatriation process, prevent further bloodshed and help resolve the conflict. Our task - that of the Security Council and UNOMIG, of the Russian Federation and any other CIS members who may join the peace-keeping force - is to respond to that call so that future citizens of the Republic of Georgia can call this effort a success.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ladsous</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa01">My delegation is particularly satisfied that our Council today was able to adopt <a href="../pdf/S-RES-937(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 937 (1994)</a>, which strengthens the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) and expands its mandate. This resolution, which for the first time establishes cooperation between the United Nations and a regional stabilization operation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), is of great importance.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa02">The conditions for a classic United Nations mission not having been met, the troops of certain member countries of the CIS, at the request of the parties, had begun to deploy in the conflict zone, in implementation of the Agreement signed in Moscow on 14 May. It was therefore necessary to be able quickly to entrust a new mandate to UNOMIG, since, along with the deployment of a force, the parties also wished United Nations observers to be able to monitor implementation of the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa03">The conditions for deployment of the peace-keeping force of the member States of the CIS, the principal elements of the mandate of UNOMIG and the modalities for cooperation and coordination between UNOMIG and the force were the subject of discussions between the Secretariat, the parties and the Russian Federation. It is on the basis of the recommendations of the Secretary-General that resulted from these discussions, in particular with respect to the assurances concerning freedom of movement and security for UNOMIG, that we have adopted the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa04">My delegation welcomes the fact that the Council has taken into account the specific nature and the innovative context of the peace-keeping operations of the CIS member States and of UNOMIG in the conflict zone. On the one hand, the intervention by a force of the CIS member States was indeed requested by the parties. On the other, a United Nations observer mission will be deployed, also at the request of the parties. The two operations, although separate, have the same goal: the implementation of the 14 May Agreement - that is, the maintenance of the cease-fire and the creation of conditions likely to facilitate the return of refugees and displaced persons. There was a need, therefore, to find a balance between the action of the peace-keeping force of the CIS member States - autonomous action - and that of a United Nations mission with a mandate from the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa05">In these circumstances, it was important to recall the essential nature of the relevant provisions of the Helsinki documents of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and of that organization's meeting, at the Ministerial level, in Rome. Those provisions lay down the framework for action by the peace-keeping force. It was also important to give UNOMIG the mandate to observe the action of the peace-keeping force of the CIS member States within the framework of the implementation of the Agreement of 14 May - a requirement that became legitimate once the United Nations was requested to participate in the implementation of the Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk04-pa06">My delegation welcomes the fact that the Russian Federation has sought the support of the Council for a regional stabilization operation in the CIS and that this operation thus becomes a part of the process of a political settlement that is under the auspices of the United Nations. This is a positive development. It emphasizes the regulatory functions that the Security Council has now shouldered for peace-keeping activities carried out by Powers or by regional forums.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ricardes</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa01">Argentina supports the measures recommended by the Secretary-General to modify the mandate and increase the number of staff serving on the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). The situation existing since the signing of the Cease-fire and Separation of Forces Agreement on 14 May makes this measure advisable.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa02">According to the approved mandate, United Nations observers will play a special role, that of monitoring the functioning of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peace-keeping force deployed in Georgia with the consent of the parties.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa03">Relations of coordination and cooperation between both forces must be defined henceforth. As is emphasized in the resolution, it is essential, in order to discharge the mission, that UNOMIG's freedom of movement be guaranteed.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa04">We trust that the CIS peace-keeping force will conduct itself in accordance with the criteria that have been defined in our Organization for peace-keeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa05">We find both useful and necessary the reports that the Russian Federation has provided the Security Council on the conduct of the CIS operation, which, of course, is in addition to the monitoring and verification functions assigned to UNOMIG.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk05-pa06">Finally, we would like to emphasize that it is a matter of paramount importance that the parties in Georgia reach an agreement that respects the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity and also ensures the return of refugees and displaced persons.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vorontsov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The Russian delegation believes that the resolution we have just adopted is an authoritative and balanced document. There is no doubt that it will play an important role in the multilevel efforts to promote a settlement to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">Obviously, an important aspect of the resolution is the clearly expressed positive attitude of the Security Council to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peace-keeping operation, which has already begun, and to the efforts of the States of the Commonwealth aimed at stabilizing the situation in the region of the conflict and at ensuring a speedy solution to the problem of the refugees. We are grateful to the Security Council for the support it has expressed for the efforts of Russia and of the other countries of the CIS.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">I should like to inform the Security Council concerning the situation regarding the deployment of the CIS peace-keeping operation in the zone of the Abkhaz conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">At present the CIS peace-keeping forces deployed in the 24-kilometre zone on both sides of the Inguri River include more than 1,600 Russian troops deployed, along with 300 units of armoured and other equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">The Russian peace-keepers are successfully carrying out their duties. Check-points and observer posts have been set up, and patrolling by mobile groups has been organized. In Sukhumi the Joint Command headquarters has begun operations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">Illegal military units are being disarmed, and considerable amounts of small arms and armoured equipment have been removed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">CIS military units are active in the demining of the area and transport routes are being restored.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Peace-keeping forces are starting to be deployed in the Kodori valley and agreement has been reached that heavy equipment of the Georgian side with either being withdrawn from this zone or be destroyed by Russian sapper engineers in the presence of United Nations observers.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">Agreement on the participation of other CIS countries in the peace-keeping operation is being concluded.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">The population greeted the Russian peace-keepers with jubilation and hope.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">The CIS operation is already promoting the stabilization of the situation, which, in turn, augurs well for the well-organized and safe return of Georgian refugees to the Gali region in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">The Russian Federation is satisfied with the Security Council's decision to expand significantly the mandate and increase the size of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). We believe that this confirmed mandate gives UNOMIG broad capabilities to effectively promote the stabilization of the situation in the region of the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa13">The Russian Federation attaches particular significance to the provision concerning cooperation with the peace-keeping forces of the CIS.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa14">As we have noted on numerous occasions, Russia and the other States of the CIS believe that the closest interaction between the peace-keeping forces of the Commonwealth and the United Nations Observer Mission is the most important condition for the successful attainment of their parallel objectives. We note that the Security Council and the Secretary-General are also in favour of this.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa15">For our part, we reaffirm our readiness to use all means available to us to ensure the effectiveness and safety of UNOMIG's activities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa16">We take particular note of the Security Council's request to the Secretary-General to establish a voluntary fund for contributions in support of both the implementation of the Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces and humanitarian aspects, as well as the appeal to Member States to contribute to that fund. Such a fund is extremely important, given the enormous expense entailed in the implementation of the Agreement, in demining and in the establishment of conditions for the return of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa17">The Russian Federation attaches great significance to the resolution's provisions reflecting the intrinsic link between peace-keeping activities in the region of the conflict and efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement and a solution to the drastic problem of refugees and displaced persons. As we have repeatedly emphasized, the peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia is not a goal in itself but, rather, an indispensable condition for accelerating the process of a comprehensive political settlement to the crisis and finding a solution to the humanitarian problems it has spawned - above all, that of the refugees and displaced persons, who should have a dignified and safe return to their homes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa18">The Russian delegation assures the members of the Security Council that the Russian Federation, as the facilitator in the political negotiating process under the aegis of the United Nations and as a party to the Quadripartite Agreement on the voluntary return of the refugees, will continue to make every effort to find a speedy solution to all unresolved problems. In this regard, the Russian Federation attaches the highest priority to close cooperation with the United Nations and with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Keating</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">New Zealand has supported this resolution, but not without some reservations. We voted in favour of it because the resolution ensures an expanded United Nations presence in Georgia. We believe that a United Nations presence is essential for the effective monitoring and verification of the Cease-fire Agreement, and we are pleased that the resolution expands both the mandate and the numbers of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG).</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">However, as we all know, there is more to this resolution than the expansion of UNOMIG. The presence of two peace-keeping operations in one country makes it imperative that the relationship between those two forces be clearly set out and well understood by all involved at all levels. There are a number of elements which - past experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations suggests - need to be addressed in such a situation. The resolution we have adopted does that.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">The first element is consistency between the concept of operations of the two forces. In this case, both operations are in Georgia with the consent of the parties, and their mandates are complementary, so there is an acceptable level of consistency.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">Secondly, there is the question of conformity with peace-keeping principles. The resolution welcomes the fact that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) force will act in accordance with the established principles and practices of the United Nations. These include, of course, those relating to peace-keeping, and it is worth recalling that the Security Council itself has approved a number of operational principles for peace-keeping, many of which would be applicable to non-United Nations forces which might be involved in peace-keeping. But I do have to say that we find this aspect of the resolution much less than satisfactory.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Thirdly, there is a need for satisfactory arrangements for interaction between the forces. The Secretary-General has indicated that, following the adoption of this resolution, he will write to the President of the Council of the CIS defining the respective roles and responsibilities of the two forces. The resolution requests him to establish an appropriate arrangement to this effect.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">Fourthly, we have the question of communication. The Secretary-General's report sets out four levels of communication, from force headquarters to patrols, all of which need to be in good working order at all times. The resolution requests the respective commanders to conclude and implement these arrangements for coordination and cooperation. This is a very important task, as relevant at the bottom of the chain of command as it is at the top.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">These various elements will help the interaction between the two forces and diminish the risk that the problems which have affected earlier peace-keeping operations in which a national or multinational contingent has sat alongside a United Nations force will be repeated. But that risk remains, and all involved must be particularly vigilant.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">My delegation welcomes the fact that the mandate of UNOMIG has now been extended for a full six months, which we believe is the minimum period of time for which it is reasonable to assign new tasks to a peace-keeping operation and expect them to be fulfilled. We are also pleased that the mandate of the expanded force is set out with clarity and precision in the resolution. It is important for all peace-keeping operations, given the political climate in which they necessarily operate, that the parties to a conflict are in no doubt as to what the United Nations operation is doing and what it is not doing.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">The resolution refers to the assurances of freedom of movement given to the Mission by the parties. This is a fundamental ingredient in any peace-keeping mission operating, as UNOMIG does, with the consent of the parties. The honouring of these assurances is one of the means by which the United Nations will judge the commitment of the parties to a political settlement of the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">My delegation also attaches importance to the provision of this resolution that UNOMIG's new mandate will include the task of observing the operation of the CIS peace-keeping force within the framework of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">The political and military situation in Georgia is now more stable, owing in large part to the political involvement of a number of external bodies that have committed themselves to assisting the parties to find a peaceful solution to the conflict: the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the CIS and the Russian Federation. We urge these parties to keep up the momentum of these negotiations. It is therefore pleasing that the cease-fire agreed upon by the parties on 14 May has held. But a political settlement cannot be attained until refugees and displaced persons are able to return to their homes. The Quadripartite Agreement of 4 April sets out the basis on which that can occur, and we urge the parties to realize that objective as quickly as possible. One of the tasks of the expanded UNOMIG is to contribute by its presence in the area to conditions conducive to the safe and orderly return of those who have had to leave their homes.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">Finally, a few words about our reservations regarding this resolution: our reservations stem from the fact that this resolution acknowledges the reality that the United Nations is not alone in Georgia monitoring the cease-fire agreement. Also in the field is the CIS force. My delegation does not believe that it is a good precedent for a neighbouring State to play such a predominant role in such a force. We believe that any operation which calls itself a peace-keeping force should be conducted strictly in accordance with United Nations peace-keeping principles. If it does not accept in a transparent way such an operational framework, then it is appropriate for the international community to proceed with caution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa13">For these reasons, my delegation does not agree that this operation sets a good precedent. To the contrary, we believe it is a precedent about which the international community should take care in the future.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">As this is the first time my delegation has spoken in a formal meeting this month, I wish to extend our congratulations to you, Sir, upon your assumption of the presidency. Your professional and personal qualities are very well known to all of us, and are a warranty that the proceedings of the Council this month will be conducted in a most efficient and congenial atmosphere.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">A word of gratitude is also in order for Ambassador Al-Khussaiby of Oman for the most proficient way in which he conducted our work during the hectic month of June.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, has gradually evolved in a more positive direction, and has demonstrated once again that a political solution acceptable to all parties to a conflict can be achieved through dialogue and negotiation. The agreement on a cease-fire and separation of forces signed in Moscow on 14 May last is, in this respect, a welcome development.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">My delegation praises the roles played by the Russian Federation as facilitator of the process and by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Edouard Brunner, in the search for a peaceful and lasting solution to the problem.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">While we are today considering the specific situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, we cannot lose sight of the broader issue concerning the future of peace-keeping operations, in particular with regard to the question of the role to be played by regional arrangements and by individual countries with a direct interest in a given crisis. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-937(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 937 (1994)</a>, which we have just adopted, represents an important departure from the original mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG), as it envisages a United Nations operation acting in parallel with, and observing, the operation of another entity. We recognize that the deployment of the peace-keeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is predicated upon the request and consent of the parties to the conflict. We welcome the wish of the parties to have the United Nations continue to be actively involved in the pursuit of a political settlement. Operationally, it is crucial that they remain committed to according full freedom of movement to UNOMIG in the performance of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">We are aware of the complexities of this issue and seek to avoid situations that might put in jeopardy the very concept of a multilateral peace-keeping force. The particular configuration of two concomitant operations contemplated in the present resolution has received our support on the clear understanding that the CIS peace-keeping force will operate in accordance with the relevant established principles and practices of the United Nations in the field of peace-keeping operations, in particular: respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; impartiality; commitment of the parties to a comprehensive political settlement; and a clearly defined mandate, concept of operations and winding-up process.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">While my delegation believes that this innovative combination of a United Nations and a CIS operation may prove a useful tool for the definitive settlement of the situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, we also believe that the United Nations should ultimately continue to play a fundamental role in this and other situations in ensuring multilateral support for the peaceful settlement of conflicts.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Brazil for the kind words he addressed to my predecessor and myself.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Rovensky</span> <span class="nation">Czech Republic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">The draft resolution on Abkhazia, Georgia, which has just been adopted by the Security Council is, in the view of my delegation, one of the most important documents adopted by the Council in recent weeks. The importance of this resolution lies in several of its key provisions, as well as in its implications. The resolution reaffirms the Security Council's commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia and the right of all refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes in secure conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The safe, early and voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons is a very difficult but crucial task. We hope that the period needed to process the registration of those willing to return will be shortened, and that more people will be able to return to their homes soon. Such a development could, in our view, have a positive influence on the solution of the sensitive problem of the spontaneous return of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">The resolution calls upon the parties concerned to intensify their efforts to achieve an early and comprehensive political settlement of the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations with the assistance of the Russian Federation as facilitator and with the participation of representatives of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">The resolution sets out in clear language the mandate of the expanded United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). It also properly addresses the crucial aspect of the mechanisms of cooperation and coordination between UNOMIG and the peace-keeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">My delegation believes that only the full implementation of UNOMIG's mandate will create favourable conditions for the effective fulfillment of peace-keeping activities in Georgia. The establishment of the highest possible level of cooperation, interaction and coordination between UNOMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force is therefore of paramount importance. In this respect, we note with satisfaction the assurances given by the parties to the conflict and by the representatives of the CIS peace-keeping force with regard to the full freedom of movement of UNOMIG in the performance of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">We also note and welcome the readiness of the Russian Federation to continue to inform the Security Council on the CIS peace-keeping activities.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">My delegation would welcome it if other CIS States, besides the Russian Federation, could as soon as possible contribute their troops to the peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, Georgia. While keeping in mind the merit of this operation, my delegation nevertheless deems it important that the Security Council should leave the door open for consideration at an appropriate point of the establishment of a United Nations peace-keeping operation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">The resolution that the Council has just adopted clearly spells out that one of the prime responsibilities of UNOMIG, besides monitoring and verifying the implementation of the Moscow Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces, is to observe the operation of the CIS peace-keeping force within the framework of the implementation of the Agreement. The observation of the CIS mission by UNOMIG has been an issue of great concern and importance to my delegation throughout the Council's deliberations on Abkhazia, Georgia. We shall therefore follow UNOMIG's reports on this issue with particular interest.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">My delegation would like to stress that by adopting today's resolution the Security Council has entered uncharted waters. For the first time we are faced with a situation in which a State with openly declared national interests in the region is undertaking a peace-keeping operation in a neighbouring country. After this first case may come other cases. Let me therefore repeat what my delegation has said before: no two peace-keeping operations are identical; each has its unique settings and features. Therefore, we do not regard today's resolution as one that would set a precedent.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">It is important to note that the CIS peace-keeping operation is taking place on the territory of one of the member States of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Even the operation itself is being conducted by CSCE member States. The CSCE is currently actively considering the criteria for its peace-keeping activities on the territory of its member States. That is why we strongly advocate that the CIS peace-keeping operation should be guided by the principles reflected in the decisions of the CSCE Council meeting held in Rome on 30 November and 1 December 1993, a document signed by all CSCE members.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">Let me conclude by stating that in my delegation's view the general thrust of the resolution we have just adopted is positive and that its provisions, if implemented properly, should contribute positively to the efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive political settlement in Abkhazia, Georgia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gomersall</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">As a member of the group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Georgia, my Government welcomes and attaches great importance to this resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">In many ways the resolution and the arrangements set out in it break new ground. This approach comes against the background of increasing demands on United Nations peace-keeping capabilities, demands that threaten to outstrip supply. It represents a response to a situation of grave concern to us all, but in which the conditions allowing for the deployment of a United Nations peace-keeping operation do not, at present, exist. The terms of this resolution reflect the importance which we all attach to various standards on the basis of which international peace-keeping efforts should take place. My delegation warmly welcomes the recognition in the resolution of the relevance in this respect of the Rome 1993 CSCE ministerial decisions on such principles. My Government therefore has no hesitation in welcoming the contribution made by the Russian Federation and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) members towards the CIS peace-keeping force.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The situation on the ground at present is relatively calm, thanks in large part to the efforts of that force. With their assistance, the withdrawal of troops of the parties and of their heavy military equipment is going ahead. We call on both parties fully to observe the arrangements on a cease-fire and separation of forces which they agreed to in Moscow on 14 May this year. This is essential if the progress so far achieved is not to be jeopardized.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">This resolution mandates the expanded United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) to work alongside the CIS peace-keeping force and elsewhere in the region, principally to promote the implementation of the 14 May cease-fire Agreement and the monitoring of the withdrawal of troops and heavy weapons of the parties, and to help to resolve difficulties as they arise. This is no small task. My Government greatly values the cooperation that has already been established on the ground between UNOMIG and the CIS force; this will be central for the success of all our efforts to restore peace to the region. We are prepared actively to support this, and my Government is ready to respond to the Secretary-General's request to contribute up to 10 military observers for UNOMIG as required.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Just as important as the efforts of UNOMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force is the search for a comprehensive political settlement. My Government fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy. We call on all sides to increase their efforts to reach a political settlement respecting fully the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia as well as ensuring the interests of all the multi-ethnic communities of Abkhazia. At the same time, valuable work is being done by the CSCE to facilitate a solution to problems elsewhere in Georgia. We warmly welcome the closer cooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">An essential part of the work of UNOMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force is promoting the conditions which would allow for the return of refugees. We pay tribute to the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and we urge the parties to cooperate fully and unconditionally with UNHCR to allow the orderly return of refugees to proceed speedily.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">We are also deeply concerned at the humanitarian situation in the region. My Government has already contributed over $4.5 million to the various United Nations, bilateral and non-governmental humanitarian organizations and supports the provisions in the resolution for a voluntary fund.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">In conclusion, we are encouraged by the way in which the operation has begun, in an open and cooperative relationship with UNOMIG. We do not want to see the United Nations involved in monitoring semi-permanent green lines. As with all peace-keeping operations, we hope that this one will achieve its objectives and be able to be terminated speedily, in political conditions which will allow the people of the region to continue their lives in peace and security.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">With the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-937(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 937 (1994)</a>, the Security Council is breaking new ground in dealing with the conflict in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, and in the methods of carrying out peace-keeping operations. In accordance with a request by the parties and the Secretary-General's recommendation, observers belonging to the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG), whose strength the Council has decided to increase and whose mandate has been enlarged, will from now on work in close cooperation with the peace-keeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The first elements of that force have begun to be deployed in the field, and they are achieving satisfactory results, as can be seen from the Secretary-General's report of 12 July and from information provided by the Russian Federation. We are sure that this will make it possible for the security zone established in the area of conflict to be free of troops and heavy military equipment of both parties to the conflict, thereby restoring the necessary atmosphere of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">This atmosphere of peace is necessary for the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes in secure conditions, without which it would be difficult to establish the necessary framework for a lasting reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">My delegation is gratified to note the progress that has been made by Quadripartite Commission, as well as the preparations that are under way to facilitate the voluntary return home of refugees and displaced persons with the assistance of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">We hope that the presence of the new United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) personnel, together with that of the peace-keeping forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will give a decisive impetus to this process, in accordance with the mandate just adopted by this Council.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">In order properly to discharge this new mandate, UNOMIG will require the full cooperation of the parties, which have already given guarantees that they will give it the necessary protection. They have also promised to allow UNOMIG the freedom of movement it requests both within the security zone and in the rest of the territory of the Republic of Georgia where its presence is required.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">I would like to note that my delegation understands this freedom of movement to include freedom of access to all areas which UNOMIG considers it necessary to enter in order properly to discharge its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">There must also be full cooperation between UNOMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force in the discharge of their respective mandates, functions and duties. This would be facilitated by the speedy conclusion of the agreements and arrangements mentioned in the resolution we have just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">It is also highly important that due account be taken throughout the highly complex operation of the principles and criteria applicable to peace-keeping operations, both defined within the context of the United Nations, with which we are all familiar, and those that are being defined within the sphere of the Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). I am referring in particular to the principles contained in the documents adopted by the Helsinki Summit of 1992 and the Ministerial Meeting in Rome of 30 November to 1 December 1993, specifically those of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the consent of parties, impartiality, multinational characteristics, transparency, a clear mandate, a connection with a political process to solve the conflict and a plan for an orderly withdrawal.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">The situation on the ground has improved and will surely continue to do so with the arrival of the new UNOMIG personnel and the full deployment of the CIS peace-keeping force. This new atmosphere should make it possible for the negotiations being conducted under the sponsorship of the United Nations, with the Russian Federation as facilitator and the participation of representatives of the CSCE, to make progress towards a final, comprehensive political solution to the problem on the basis of the principles contained in the United Nations Charter and the relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">In this connection, I should like to highlight the important role that the CSCE can play in the search for a solution to the constitutional problems and those relating to human rights, as well as the contribution it can make to the progress and eventual success of the negotiations. My delegation hopes that the negotiating meeting scheduled for August will yield the desired results and that the peace process will be consolidated, for although it is still fragile, its prospects are encouraging.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Khussaiby</span> <span class="nation">Oman</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">At the outset, allow me to express to you, Sir, and to your friendly country our sincere congratulations on your assumption of the high-level position of President of the Security Council. We are confident that through your well-known diplomatic skills and competence you will steer the work of this Council in an exemplary manner.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">With regard to the situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, my delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his reports, and would like to welcome the Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces signed in Moscow on 14 May 1994. The implementation of this Agreement is currently taking place under the supervision of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peace-keeping force. We would also like to welcome the Quadripartite Agreement between the two parties, reached through the assistance of the United Nations and the Russian Federation in Moscow on 4 April 1994, which will guarantee the safe return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes in Abkhazia under orderly and secure conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The Sultanate of Oman considers these types of agreements quite significant for their help in creating an environment that will be conducive to bringing the two parties to the conflict - the Georgians and the Abkhazians - much closer to a peaceful settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">My delegation attaches great importance to the need for the United Nations to take an active role in Abkhazia, particularly given the desire expressed by both sides to involve the United Nations in the overall settlement of the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">My delegation therefore supported the extension of UNOMIG's mandate for an additional period of six months which will expire on 13 January 1995, as well as the proposed increase in the strength of UNOMIG in accordance with the new mandate entrusted to it as recommended by the Secretary-General in his report of 12 July 1994. This mandate includes, among other things, the monitoring of the work of the CIS peace-keeping force in the practical implementation of the Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces of 14 May 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">My delegation believes that the presence of UNOMIG and its role in Abkhazia is quite essential and we view it as complementary to that of the CIS force. We are quite confident that all parties concerned will cooperate fully with UNOMIG in accordance with the agreed principles and guidelines that guarantee unimpeded freedom of movement for its personnel in the discharge their duties and functions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">Since we believe that regional groups and organizations can play a positive role in addressing regional issues, my delegation appreciates the vital role taken by the CIS in resolving the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict in its capacity as the pertinent regional organization concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">We also support the important conciliatory role of UNOMIG, which is consistent with the noble objectives enshrined in the United Nations Charter. My delegation has thus voted in favour of the resolution just adopted.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ayewah</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">Permit me to convey to you, Sir, the compliments of the Nigerian delegation as you preside over the affairs of the Council during the month of July. You have already displayed your wealth of experience and enormous diplomatic skill in handling some of the delicate issues that have engaged the Council's attention. By the same token, my delegation would like to express its thanks to your predecessor in office, Ambassador Al-Khussaiby of Oman, for the excellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of the Council during the month of June.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">My delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his useful reports on the situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, which formed the basis of Council's deliberations on the resolution we have just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">My delegation remains concerned about the general security and political situation in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, in spite of the relative calm that has prevailed in the area of conflict for some time now. While we are encouraged by the Quadripartite Agreement on the voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons signed in Moscow in April 1994, as well as the Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces signed on 14 May 1994, we are conscious of the fact that only serious political negotiations leading to a final settlement hold the key to peace in the area.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">Since listening to the address of the President of Georgia, Edouard Shevardnadze, on 9 March 1994, my Government has supported his plea for a full-fledged United Nations peace-keeping operation to be deployed in the area of conflict. We are not convinced by the argument that an agreement on a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict should be the condition for the deployment of such a force.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In the prevailing situation, we welcome the decision of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to heed the appeal of both parties and deploy its collective peace-keeping force within the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. We also welcome the quick response of the Russian Federation in deploying a contingent to the area. We are happy to note that the arrival of this force has already improved the situation on the ground. We hope that other member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States will soon contribute to the force so as to guarantee its multinational character.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">The resolution we have just adopted has been described as ground-breaking. My delegation does not see it in that light. It is perhaps innovative in terms of language and drafting, but certainly not ground-breaking in terms of concept. With the demands for United Nations collective peace-keeping outstripping its ability and resources, it has already become clear and imperative that regional organizations and/or arrangements must step in. In all modesty, we in the West African subregion can claim to have already blazed that trail with the arrangement in Liberia of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which was later complemented by the United Nations through its Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL). We view the current resolution as a further development and refinement of a variant of that concept. We cannot but advert to the desirability of promoting cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in the maintenance of regional peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">We are satisfied at the outcome of the consultations that have so far taken place between the Secretary-General and the parties to the conflict, as well as representatives of the Russian Federation and those of the CIS, in order to reach a clear understanding on the relationship between the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) in its expanded form and forces of the CIS. We agree with the recommendation of the Secretary-General concerning the size of an expanded UNOMIG and its tasks, as described by him in paragraph 5 of his report, as well as the duration of the mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">In spite of the extensive discussions that have taken place on the aspects of cooperation and coordination between UNOMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force, there is a need to ensure that such cooperation and coordination exists on the ground. In this regard, we welcome the assurances given by the parties and the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as the intention of the Secretary-General further to clarify this matter of cooperation and coordination by writing to the Chairman in Council of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The problem of over a quarter of a million refugees and displaced persons, victims of the conflict in Abkhazia, is at the heart of the conflict, and its resolution will be crucial to a final political settlement. My delegation has already expressed its concern on this subject. In this context, we welcome the Quadripartite Agreement of April on the voluntary return of refugees to their homes in secure conditions. Coming from a continent where the problem of refugees is acute, and growing, we cannot but be concerned by the plight of about a quarter of a million people who have had to endure harsh weather conditions on hills and mountains for over nine months now. We urge all parties to honour their agreement to allow the return of the refugees to their homes and call on them to continue to respect the cease-fire Agreement, a necessary condition for an early return of refugees. In this connection, we cannot but commend the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). We appeal to States to assist that agency with generous contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">Finally, my delegation would like to appeal to the parties to heed our call in operative paragraph 2 of this resolution to intensify their efforts towards the achievement of an early and comprehensive political settlement. This is the only guarantee of lasting peace and stability. As noted in the preambular part of this resolution, the Council has not ruled out the option of the deployment of a full-fledged United Nations peace-keeping operation once a final political settlement is achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">My delegation would like to thank the personnel of UNOMIG for their exemplary work, and we call on the parties to extend full support and the necessary protection to UNOMIG in carrying out its mandate, and to respect its neutral character.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa12">On the basis of the foregoing considerations, my delegation voted in favour of the resolution. We hope that this will contribute to the creation of a favourable climate not only for the return of the refugees but, more importantly in the end, for the achievement of a political settlement.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">My delegation voted in favour of the resolution just adopted by the Security Council on the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, primarily because it extends and expands the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG), which we fully support. We believe that an expanded UNOMIG will be an important instrument for ensuring peace and stability in the area and should contribute to the early and voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">My delegation appreciates the efforts of the member States of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in establishing and deploying a peace-keeping force in Georgia. However, we would have preferred that such a peace-keeping operation be organized by the United Nations and that it be under United Nations command.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Pakistan is concerned over an emerging tendency to attribute peace-keeping roles to the countries of the region, or those closest to the conflict, especially when such countries have direct political interests in the area of the conflict. The States Members of the United Nations should in no way abrogate their Charter responsibilities in such a manner.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">My delegation is aware of the present financial difficulties faced by the United Nations, particularly in relation to its peace-keeping operations. These constraints, however, should not be allowed to impinge upon the obligations of the United Nations to uphold peace and security around the world. It is our common responsibility not to allow any erosion of the system of collective security as envisaged in the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">My delegation does not favour the practice of post-facto endorsement by the Security Council of a regional peace-keeping operation which is outside the purview of the United Nations. In this context, we have some reservations on the existing formulation of operative paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">My delegation hopes that the composition of the CIS peace-keeping force will soon be diversified by troop contributions from other member States of the CIS and that this force will act strictly in accordance with the established peace-keeping principles and practices of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">We express the hope that the CIS will continue to report to the Security Council, on a regular basis, on the activities of its peace-keeping force in Georgia.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa10">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa11">There are no further names on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
