	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa01">The General Assembly will now resume consideration of agenda item 22, entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal".</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa02">In this connection, I should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-971.pdf">A/54/971</a>, which contains a solemn appeal that I made</p>
	<blockquote id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa03">on 1 September 2000 in connection with the observance of the Olympic Truce.</blockquote>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa04">I will now read the solemn appeal:</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa05">"On 24 November 1999, the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-34.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 54/34</a>, in which it urged Member States to observe the Olympic Truce during the games of the XXVII Olympiad, which will be held at Sydney, Australia, from 15 September to 1 October 2000.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa06">"The idea of the Olympic Truce dates back to an ancient Greek tradition of <i>ekecheiria</i>, in keeping with which all hostilities would cease during the Games.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa07">"Today, the Olympic Truce has become an expression of mankind's desire to build a world based on the rules of fair competition, peace, humanity and reconciliation. Moreover, the Olympic Truce epitomizes a bridge from the old and wise tradition to the most compelling purpose of the United Nations -- the maintenance of international peace and security. As the most visible illustration of this connection in goals and aspirations between the Olympic movement and the United Nations, the flag of the United Nations now flies at all competition sites of the Olympic Games.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa08">"The forthcoming Sydney Games -- the first Olympic Games of the twenty-first century and of the new millennium -- should be a harmonious, athlete-oriented and environmentally</p>
	<blockquote id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa09">committed event. The period of the Games, and beyond, should provide an opportunity for dialogue, reconciliation and the search for durable solutions for the restoration of peace in all areas of conflict, where the first victims are the children, the youth and women.</blockquote>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa10">"Humanity's quest is for a world free of hatred and war, a world where ideals of peace, goodwill and mutual respect form the basis of relations among countries. That goal may still remain elusive, but if the Olympic Truce can help us to bring about even a brief respite from conflict and strife, it will send a powerful message of hope to the international community. With the United Nations flag flying in Sydney at the XXVII Olympic Games, adherence to the Truce will gain even greater symbolism.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa11">"I therefore solemnly appeal to all States to demonstrate their commitment to the spirit of fraternity and understanding among peoples by observing the Olympic Truce during the Sydney Games.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa12">"I urge all those who are now engaged in armed struggle -- for whatever reasons and wherever it might be -- to suspend hostilities in keeping with the observance. I urge everybody, individually and collectively, to take the initiative to abide by the Olympic Truce as a way of promoting goodwill and encouraging the peaceful settlement of conflicts in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations."</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg001-bk06-pa13">May I take it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to take note of the solemn appeal in connection with the observance of the Olympic Truce?</p>

	<p id="docA54PV100-pg002-bk08-pa01">My country's delegation already presented its comments on paragraph 9, bullet 8, dealing with sanctions. We wish to reaffirm here that this eighth bullet contains a double-standard provision relating to economic sanctions. The paragraph does not reflect the point of view of the international community and United Nations Member States.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg002-bk08-pa02">As expressed many times, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-242.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/242</a>, adopted by consensus, puts forward the basic principles -- namely, the need to exhaust all peaceful means before resorting to sanctions, which can only be considered as a last resort. Economic sanctions, if necessary, can be imposed only when they are in conformity with the principles of the Charter, after having determined the objectives of the sanctions, having a clear time table and having included provisions allowing for a regular re-examination of the sanctions and precise conditions linked to lifting them. Sanctions cannot be used for the purposes of pure revenge or reprisal.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg002-bk08-pa03">Unfortunately, the United States and the United Kingdom and their Kuwaiti agents have insisted on maintaining this subparagraph as it is. This paragraph allows innocent populations to be targeted through sanctions. My delegation is surprised to see how this double standard policy can be so flagrantly used in such a United Nations document, adopted on the eve of the new millennium.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg002-bk08-pa04">Why are we asking for a reduction of the harmful effects of the economic sanctions against innocent populations, and at the same time ask that they be removed from third countries? It would be better to remove the harmful effects of sanctions from innocent populations as well as third parties. My delegation has shown great flexibility in order to reach a consensus text. Unfortunately, once again we are forced to note that the United States, the United Kingdom and their Kuwaiti agents have insisted on keeping this paragraph, which has no legitimacy, either legal or moral. The delegation of this country cannot accept such a shameful text.</p>

There were more countries than those that you have mentioned who did not support you. You have the right to place on record the position of your Government, but I take very serious exception to the implication contained in the statement you have just made.

	<p id="docA54PV100-pg003-bk04-pa02">On behalf of France, I have a brief statement to make. France has a reservation to the idea of convening an international conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers. In relation to the options which can lead to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, we would recall our preference for convening a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV100-pg003-bk05-pa01">On behalf of the United States I would like to make some comments on the document which we are transmitting to the fifty-fifth General Assembly to be read as a declaration at the end of the Millennium Summit to be held from 6 to 8 September.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg003-bk05-pa02">Earlier this year, the fifty-fourth General Assembly accepted an important challenge. The challenge was to draw upon the observations so eloquently expressed in the Secretary-General's March report, a discussion of the role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century, in order to develop a declaration which would allow the Heads of State and Government who are even now converging on New York to reaffirm their faith in the United Nations and its Charter.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg003-bk05-pa03">I do not need to tell you, Mr. President, or anyone else gathered in this room, that the draft we have before us is the result of extensive negotiation and significant compromise by many, if not all, member States. Our combined goal was a consensus document summarizing values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century, and identifying key objectives for the future. While the document we have before us generally meets that goal, the United States has reservations about certain aspects of this text. Specifically, in the section referring to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the document continues to refer to keeping all options open, including the possibility of convening an international conference to identify ways of eliminating nuclear dangers. The United States has strong and often repeated reservations to such a conference.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg003-bk05-pa04">The United States welcomes the reference in this document to the issue of climate change and is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We believe strongly that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution. We also note that economic growth and emissions growth need not go together. Over the past two years, United States economic growth has been 4 per cent or higher, and growth in greenhouse emissions has been 1 per cent or lower.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg003-bk05-pa05">With respect to the Kyoto Protocol, the United States notes that ratification in many countries, including the United States, is subject to the approval of national legislators, and that no reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required by the Protocol, unless and until that agreement is ratified and enters into force.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg003-bk05-pa06">Finally, in the important section focused on meeting the special needs of Africa, the United States regrets that the paragraph describing measures to address the challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in Africa, made reference to debt cancellation. The United States believes that it would have been more accurate and useful to refer to the need, which the United States recognizes and supports, for member States and international financial institutions to work with the Governments of African countries to develop programmes of debt relief, including debt forgiveness, taking into account demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction.</p>

We consider that the draft Declaration is for the most part well balanced. Despite the varied perceptions of the United Nations and its role in the world, which we have again seen reflected in recent debates, the text has succeeded in gaining mostly positive assessments, with only a few potential reservations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg004-bk05-pa02">I am pleased to say again that Cuba has no reservations about the draft resolution we have just adopted. We are pleased that the draft Declaration reaffirms our faith in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. We agree that support for multilateralism should result in all States sharing responsibility for the conduct of international relations in the new century. Cuba remains a steadfast defender of respect for international law.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg004-bk05-pa03">We view it as very positive that the draft Declaration recognizes nuclear disarmament as a priority; here we reaffirm our support for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg004-bk05-pa04">We would have liked to see a clearer distinction between poverty eradication on the one hand and development on the other, and we note that references to the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights are absent from the section on human rights, democracy and good governance.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg004-bk05-pa05">Strengthening the United Nations in the twenty-first century is undoubtedly an important step towards attaining the goals and commitments set out in the draft Declaration.</p>

The delegation of Iraq continues its practice of offering its own views but not wishing to hear from Kuwait. We reject that, along with the accusation that we are arrogant. My delegation affirms that no State has the right to drag Kuwait into matters that are none of its concern. We are a sovereign country and certainly have the right to express our views.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa01">I have the honour to introduce to the General Assembly the draft resolution entitled "Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in all its aspects", contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.88-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/54/L.88/Rev.1</a>. I am pleased to announce that this draft resolution has been sponsored by over 70 delegations representing all regions of the world.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa02">I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to the sponsors and to all delegations whose constructive participation in the informal consultations resulted in the consensus text of this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa03">I want to stress that HIV/AIDS, we are convinced, is an epidemic of global proportions with enormous human and social ramifications that go far beyond the province of health alone. The issue of HIV/AIDS has already been taken up at different international forums, both within the United Nations system and outside. It is encouraging that this increased attention to the problem of AIDS has started to bring in the first positive results.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa04">At the same time, it is absolutely clear that only the concerted and coordinated efforts of the international community will be able to successfully address the problem of HIV/AIDS. My country, which has also been hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, spreading at an alarming rate in recent years, believes that it is high time for the United Nations to elaborate a comprehensive agenda for action against this epidemic. The General Assembly should, in our view, play the central role in resolving this issue of global concern.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa05">We do believe that the draft resolution that is now before us is intended to start this process. It will enable the General Assembly to make its significant contribution to the struggle of the international community against AIDS by convening the special session, which, in our view, is the most appropriate forum for this purpose.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa06">The main goal of this draft resolution is stated in its first operative paragraph: to convene a special session of the General Assembly as soon as possible, preferably in May 2001, but not later than the end of its fifty-sixth regular session, in order to review and address the problem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects, as well as to coordinate and intensify international efforts to combat it.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa07">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.88-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/54/L.88/Rev.1</a> reflects the deep concern of the international community over the accelerating spread of human immunodeficiency virus, which has already infected millions of people worldwide, and over the resulting increase in cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The draft resolution also urges Member States and observers to ensure their representation at the special session at a high political level.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa08">To properly arrange this crucial event, the draft envisages that the exact date of the special session, as well as the modalities, participation in and organization of the preparatory process and of the special session itself should be finalized, at the earliest opportunity, at its fifty-fifth session.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa09">For this purpose, it proposes to include in the agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in all its aspects".</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk03-pa10">In conclusion, allow me to express my sincere hope that draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-54-L.88-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/54/L.88/Rev.1</a> will gain the broadest possible support and will be adopted by the General Assembly by consensus.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk05-pa02">The challenge of the AIDS epidemic is dreadful in its brutality and breadth. Attention needs to be focused upon it. We know that this can only be done if all the people concerned, at the local, national, regional and international levels, are fully committed through joint and coordinated efforts and actions. The United Nations and the General Assembly of its Member States, in particular, is an irreplaceable forum in this respect. This is the reason for the support of the European Union for this draft resolution at this session of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk05-pa03">The European Union hopes that, as of the first weeks of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, a concentrated and effective preparatory process will allow all delegations to decide together on the ways and means of participating in this session and in its organization.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk05-pa04">Thus, we will have to decide upon the appropriate timing for the holding of this session. The time-frame established by the present resolution is firm and realistic. It is firm, because it establishes the objective of not being deferred beyond September 2002. It is realistic, because we all know that, as of now, the year 2001 is already heavily burdened with high-level meetings and the preparatory procedures which will relate to essential subjects -- the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, follow-up to the World Summit for Children, the World Conference on Racism and the follow-up to the Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, and so forth.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk05-pa05">The European Union wishes to thank the authors of the draft resolution -- Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Nigeria, Ukraine and Zimbabwe. They were at the start of this process, and thanks to them, today there are a large number of us sponsoring the text of the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg010-bk05-pa06">Finally, the European Union also wishes to thank all of those delegations who have worked most constructively and transparently throughout the informal sessions towards working out a consensus.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk06-pa02">As members are aware, these items, with the exception of sub-item (b) of agenda item 101 entitled "Economic and technical cooperation among developing countries", item 123 entitled "Joint Inspection Unit", item 150 entitled "Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone", and item 163 entitled "Review of the implementation of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-48-218.pdf">General Assembly resolution 48/218</a> B", have been included in the provisional agenda of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. May I take it that the Assembly considers that discussion of these items at the present session is concluded?</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">The President</span><span class="nation"></span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa01">Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, and it is time for me now to prepare handing over the gavel to my worthy successor.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa02">We had a unique and most memorable experience. It was the first-ever session of the General Assembly which straddled two centuries and two millenniums. Foremost among the most memorable things was the responsibility for preparing for the unprecedented United Nations Millennium Summit of heads of State or Government. The world will be witnessing the largest gathering of world leaders. This is really making history, and the final declaration will put meat on the bones.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa03">We held three special sessions. The first one was held in September last year, on small island developing States and their special needs. And the other two took place in June this year, one as a follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women, held at Beijing in 1995, and the other as a follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development, held at Copenhagen in 1995; these two special sessions took place in New York and in Geneva respectively.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa04">All three special sessions adopted action-oriented declarations and platforms for implementation, taking into consideration the outstanding progress already achieved by Member States and other key international and national stakeholders. I recommend that the fifth-fifth session of the General Assembly pay close attention to these important outcome documents and give effect to their recommendations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa05">We actively pursued the agenda of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council. Regrettably, the debate is into its seventh year. Once again, it proved impossible for Member States to resolve the major sticking points, among them the admission of new permanent members, the exercise of the veto and some problematic procedural matters.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa06">There has, however, been some noticeable progress as regards the working methods of the Security Council. The Council has begun opening up its meetings to the other United Nations Member States as well as interacting informally with non-governmental organizations. This openness and flexibility must be encouraged. The fundamental problem seems to be a manifest lack of political will on the part of some permanent members. In the light of this gridlock, which is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, I am of the view that we should revisit the fixed position of a "package deal". There are some new and creative ideas to move the debate forward.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa07">In the meantime, I hope that the growing sense of urgency among a large number of States about the need to reform, enlarge and democratize the Security Council will be embraced by all. I invite representatives to carefully study the latest report of the aforementioned working group. It contains practical proposals on the way forward.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa08">Moreover, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 53/92 and 54/234, I established a working group to operationalize the implementation of the Secretary-General's recommendations contained in his 1998 report on the causes of conflict and the consequences thereof in Africa. The working group has submitted specific proposals to overcome any bottlenecks, taking into account the outstanding recommendations of the Economic and Social Council. Those proposals are attached to the report that is now before the fifth-fifth session of the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa09">On another, but related, issue, the Assembly also decided to convene in 2001 a critical intergovernmental conference on financing for development. This is a topical subject which is today at the core of the current debate on development, poverty eradication, debt cancellation, full employment and prosperity for all. I see it in the context of a global challenge which hinges on both political will and resource mobilization, something which I have talked about. In this context, I undertook setting up a bureau of the preparatory committee for that conference, and its planning activities have commenced in earnest. The participation in the forthcoming high-level conference by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Development Programme and other actors is indispensable from the word go. We need such partnerships in order to fulfil the goals and development plans of the United Nations. I commend the General Assembly for having launched what I consider to be a people-driven rescue operation.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa10">The United Nations Millennium Summit will start tomorrow in this Hall. It will indeed be a historic moment both for the United Nations and for humanity at large. By the time the general debate starts next week, we will be celebrating its outcome and paying tribute to the world leaders for their collective will for world peace, cooperation and development and for their reaffirmation of support for the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa11">It was my privilege to have presided over the preparations for the Millennium Summit, and I want to thank all delegations for their cooperation in bringing the preparations to a successful conclusion. The Millennium Summit will adopt a final declaration. It is expected to be a politically authoritative document of historic import commensurate with the uniqueness of the Summit itself for all times.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa12">During the course of my presidency, I remained faithful to the mandate of the General Assembly, consistent with the United Nations Charter. I tried to give equal importance to all the agenda items and to those issues that came up from different sources, within the context of the mandate given to the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa13">There were, however, certain matters that I felt needed extra emphasis because of what I considered to be their critical impact on the United Nations, its Member States and the world at large. Those issues included United Nations reform, humanitarian intervention, women's rights, the plight of children, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, poverty eradication, the debt burden, financing for development, and enhancement of the authority and integrity of the General Assembly. I will elaborate on them on another occasion in my capacity as Namibia's Foreign Minister.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa14">Earlier, I mentioned the protracted and frustrating United Nations reform process. I would like to reiterate my strong views in relation, in particular, to the functions and powers of the General Assembly. The Charter stipulates in various places encompassing and indisputable functions and powers of the Assembly. These qualities have been further enlarged significantly by subsequent United Nations resolutions and decisions, not excluding the role of the General Assembly in the field of peacekeeping and peace enforcement.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa15">During the past 12 months, I personally witnessed the extent to which the authority and integrity of the General Assembly continued to become the object of denigration as a way of currying favour with the other organs. I expressed my concerns on this subject in my acceptance speech last year. It is high time for the Member States, particularly the developing countries, to redress the persistent attacks on and marginalization of this foremost organ of the United Nations, the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa16">From 1960 onwards, the membership of the United Nations has grown by leaps and bounds, and now stands at 188. Today, it will become 189. The General Assembly is unlike any other body: it is the most representative, democratic, transparent and deliberative policy-making organ of all the United Nations. The real business starts here and ends here. This is one of the burning issues so close to my heart, and I will deal with it later. For now, my job is done. That is what I came for: nothing more, nothing less. But the General Assembly endures. And that is my imprimatur.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa17">I am not the first, and I will definitely not be the last, to renew the call for closer and more regularized cooperation, coordination and action among the principal officers of the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat. Such institutionalized, routinized and sustained interaction at the highest levels of our Organization will reinforce its capacity to measure success and ensure cost-effectiveness and efficiency throughout the system.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa18">This is absolutely vital at a time when rapidly changing international circumstances and challenges require one vision, one voice and joint action through the principal organs of the United Nations. I have not forgotten the others, but these four are at the centre of the day-to-day activities of our Organization.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa19">The United Nations faces challenging times in this century. One of the best ways to ensure its efficacy and performance is for it to be provided with sufficient resources and assured political support. To this end, Member States must pay their assessed and legally obligatory contributions on time, in full and without conditions. This matter has now become a bone of serious contention with serious political repercussions indeed for the United Nations. The current state of the Organization's finances is precarious, and a lasting solution must be found urgently.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa20">During the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Member States will deal once again with a lengthy agenda containing the whole gamut of critical challenges and current problems facing the United Nations. But we know only too well, do we not, that virtually all the debilitating and critical social issues in the world were short-listed, analysed and defined in specific programmes and plans of action a long time ago.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa21">We know this from the United Nations summits of the 1990s that sought to place before the Member States matters of public policy prioritizing and financing for development by the international community. The goals of that people-centred agenda remain intact. They are summed up in the words peace, development, resource mobilization and human security.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa22">If there is determined political will backed up by adequate financial resources, the developing countries and their poor masses will be well placed to deal effectively with the problems of education for all, gender equality, health care, childcare, poverty eradication, rural development, clean water and infrastructure building. I am saying that we all know exactly what the problems, needs and priorities of the poor are. What has been in short supply is the delivery of resources to engender sustainable social development.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa23">Over the last year, I spoke up at every opportunity on the heart-wrenching topic of the suffering of and deliberate violence against the world's children, especially those trapped in armed conflict. I, together with so many other committed co-workers throughout the world, have tried to help sensitize the international community. I have used my office to raise the profile of this issue higher. I want to pay tribute to all United Nations agencies, organizations, offices and individuals the world over who have become part and parcel of this noble crusade.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa24">Their efforts to ensure a better, safer and more humane place for the sake of the leaders of the future and the repositories of human civilization -- our children -- will sustain this most sacred cause. Our children are tomorrow's champions of dialogue, not of the clash of world civilizations, which make us different but yet unite us in diversity. We are one. We swim together or we sink together: the choice is ours. But saving children must come first.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa25">The General Assembly this year adopted a new Optional Protocol to the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. This welcome achievement will further assist in the betterment of the welfare of children, their protection from child labour, from sexual exploitation, from destructive wars and from shameful pornography.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa26">While I am encouraged by the growing commitment by the Member States of the United Nations to safeguard and promote the well-being of children, quite a lot still remains to be done. The General Assembly must continue to remain vigilant in protecting our children and blame and shame by name and place their tormentors and accomplices.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa27">One of the most urgent challenges today is that of putting the needs of the people at the centre of the global agenda of peace and development and democracy. This is what I said in Geneva during the closing ceremony of the special session on social development. We must summon all the necessary political will, mobilize the requisite resources and focus on people-centred priorities to defeat poverty, hunger, want and fear from the face of the Earth once and for all. Compassion, generosity and sharing are noble virtues that should govern human relations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa28">While the United Nations is not a perfect Organization, it is the only true, universal and representative international common home we have. It is here, and nowhere else, that we can together ensure world peace and development for the benefit of all. This must be our common hope and expectation from the United Nations Millennium Summit, which starts tomorrow in this majestic Hall of States and "We the Peoples".</p>
	<p id="docA54PV100-pg012-bk09-pa29">I have a long roster of wonderful people to thank. I will happily do that in the fullness of time.</p>
