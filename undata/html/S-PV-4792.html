<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Security Council to <a href="../pdf/S-2003-710.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2003/710</a>, which contains the text of a letter dated 15 July 2003 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> concerning counter-terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I shall now give a briefing in my capacity as the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">It is a pleasure for me to address the Council for the first time in my capacity as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), which I have headed since April. Before I outline the main points of the programme of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, I should like to make some general comments in my capacity not as Chairman of the Committee, but as the representative of Spain.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">Spain's commitment to the fight against terrorism is well known to all Council members. It is a commitment involving not only my Government but also -- what is more important -- civil society. My country has suffered for more than 30 years from this plague, in which more than a thousand of my compatriots have been murdered. For us, it is essential that the fight against terrorism be one of the priorities in United Nations action. That objective must permeate the Organization's entire mandate. We have learned that the fight against terrorism will be long and that there are no shortcuts that will enable us to attain our goals easily or swiftly. Sometimes we hear voices that demand swift and drastic solutions, but we must not allow ourselves to be deceived by such siren songs.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">We must continue along the lines of what we agreed on 23 January in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>, which stipulates in its annex that States must ensure that the measures they adopt to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, particularly with norms related to human rights, to refugees and to humanitarian law. We must be extremely careful in that regard. Legitimacy, law and reason are on our side, and we must not adopt any measure that runs the risk of putting us at odds with them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">Now I should like to speak in my capacity as Chairman of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">The Committee is one of the most important tools, with the greatest and most universal influence, on which the international community can rely in its fight against terrorism. The fact that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, which concerns action in case of threats against peace, gives it a power that is commensurate with the threat that we face. In the more than a year and a half since its inception, the CTC has been involved in an enormous scope of activity. Two figures are enough to demonstrate that: the first is that, in September 2001 -- when the resolution was adopted -- only two States of the international community were parties to the 12 conventions and protocols related to the fight against terrorism. By 30 June this year, there were already 37. For example, the International Convention for the Repression of Terrorist Acts Committed with Bombs has seen a 71 per cent increase in its ratification rate, and the 1999 International Convention for the Repression of the Financing of Terrorism has seen a 94 per cent increase. The second figure that I wish to touch upon is that, to date, a total of 385 reports have been received from States in response to letters sent by the Committee related to the measures contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">But, beyond statistics, the Committee has done important work in the field of technical assistance. It is interesting to recall that the Committee conducts its work on the basis of three principles: transparency, equal treatment and coordination. With regard to transparency, the Committee regularly holds informational meetings that are open to all Member States. We also have a web page on which we have been working for several months to improve and update; it will soon be available in a more user-friendly form. Equal treatment is demonstrated by, among other things, the regular contact we maintain with representatives of Member States and of international organizations. Coordination has been demonstrated in the tightening of the links between the Committee and the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>. A joint press communiqué has been elaborated that compares both Committees to make it easier for the media to follow the respective activities of the Committees.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">At another level, we wish to point out that, in the short term, the CTC faces two important challenges. The first is the paper that it must adopt in the field of technical assistance. One of the Committee's principal advantages is its universality, a result of its inclusion in the United Nations framework. That universality, in our judgment, should be used to help, to the greatest extent possible, those States that demonstrate genuine political will in the fight against terrorism, but at the same time have difficulties in implementing the measures contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. To that end, the Committee is taking steps towards a serious strengthening of its work in that field.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">We can now rely on two instruments -- the Directory of Counter-Terrorism Information and Sources of Assistance and the Matrix of Assistance, which have been shown to be essential tools but have also begun to demonstrate certain limitations. They were adequate when the Committee functioned as a "switchboard", but we should now like to adopt a more proactive role. We believe the Committee should be able to help States that request assistance in the process of implementing the resolution. The Committee must be able to ensure that the needs of those countries are truly met.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">But, at the same time, the Committee must play an increasingly greater role in the promotion and coordination of available international assistance, using its broad experience to orient States and international donor organizations towards the priorities that the Committee is now beginning to be able to identify. It is not a matter of giving priority to one State over another, but rather, of having criteria available that will enable us to deal first with issues that we consider most urgent within each State.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The second challenge is that of tightening the links between the Committee and relevant international, regional and subregional organizations. The first step was taken under the British presidency when, on 6 March, the first meeting with more than 60 such organizations was held here. After the meeting, a plan of action was adopted that we have been implementing and that has produced concrete results. I should also like to highlight the contacts that we have maintained with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the World Customs Organization, Interpol and the International Atomic Energy Agency, in which the danger represented by terrorist groups having access to weapons of mass destruction or to dangerous material of a radioactive, chemical or biological nature were highlighted. In our judgment, the latter threat has not been given the attention it deserves, which is why we intend to remain seized of the matter. We must also mention the work that we are doing with the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism, part of the Organization of American States, which will organize a meeting in Washington on 7 October directly related to the one already mentioned, held in March.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">I should now like to refer briefly to the programme of work planned for April to July of this year. We are pleased to share with members that the great majority of objectives that it set forth were not only met, but sometimes even exceeded. For example, the Directory of contacts and their details have been improved. A first group of 17 international organizations relevant to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has been contacted. In addition, by having completed the review of 385 reports, we have exceeded by 35 the reports objective established in the programme of work.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">With regard to the programme of work for the months of July to September, I do not believe that I need to refer to it in detail, since all Council members have a copy of it available to them. However, I wish to highlight a number of points. Within the spirit of the Committee's cooperation with Member States, we have decided to undertake measures to help the 36 States that have fallen behind in submitting their reports so that they comply with their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We shall continue to work to promote the broadest possible participation in the 12 international conventions and protocols related to the fight against terrorism. And, as I said earlier, technical assistance and strengthening cooperation between the Committee and international organizations will be priorities for the coming months.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">Finally, speaking again in my capacity as the representative of Spain, I would like to say that my country will spare no effort to ensure that the CTC achieves concrete and practical results that contribute to increasing the number of instruments available to the international community in its legitimate fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">I thank Council members for their understanding and cooperation.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Karev</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">Thank you, Mr. President, for having convened this meeting, the purpose of which, as we see it, is not only to review progress to date but also to determine priorities, forms and methods for the subsequent work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). Not only the quality of work of the Committee, but also the specific contribution of each State to building on anti-terrorist cooperation, will depend on our ability to do so in a timely and proper manner will depend not only on the quality of the work of the Committee but on the specific contribution of each State to building on anti-terrorist cooperation. You, Mr. President, have successfully taken over the chairmanship of the CTC, and we believe that, under your leadership, the Committee will continue to work in an organized, effective and, most importantly, creative way. You are deserving of our highest appreciation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">Thanks to the efforts of members of the Council, CTC experts and Secretariat staff, and active cooperation on the part of the vast majority of countries, the Committee is successfully complying with the obligations set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and has assumed its rightful place as the central coordinating body in the process of establishing a global anti-terrorist structure. This has been facilitated by the time-tested principles and methods of our joint work: openness, cooperation and impartiality.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">It has become a useful tradition in our meetings to focus particular attention on the conceptual and practical aspects of developing the work of the CTC. We hope that this meeting will prove to be no exception in that respect. The search for fresh ideas and constructive solutions will continue on the basis of compliance with generally recognized principles and norms of international law and consideration of the legitimate interests of individual States and the entire international community. The intensive phasing-in of the second and third stages of the CTC's work, calling for identifying the effectiveness of the work done by national administrative institutions designed to suppress terrorist activity and to hand over terrorists and their accomplices to the justice system, will mean an increased workload for members, experts and Secretariat staff.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">In this regard, I would like to make several observations. Compared with the harmonization and unification of legislation, which, in general, is proceeding successfully, we have at out disposal scarcely any standard anti-terrorist models that, when applied, would be equally effective in all countries. Looking for solutions in specific situations will require individual approaches. In circumstances where the CTC has no adequate financial or management resources in that respect, specific focus must be placed on stepping up the Committee's cooperation with profiling, regional and sectoral organizations. They have information and resources to facilitate the implementation of various projects in specific countries.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">Setting in motion all of this potential across the board will allow us not only to resolve specific challenges with maximum effectiveness and to avoid duplication in our work, but to take on the practical job of establishing a global and comprehensive system to counter terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">Russia fully supports the efforts of the CTC to establish permanent working contacts with 17 international organizations, as well as the Committee's plans to increase the list of its partners. Particularly promising is the CTC's cooperation with the activities of the Group of Eight's counter-terrorism body, which was established to flesh out the existing multilateral anti-terrorist mechanisms and to provide support to the CTC in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">We hope that, overall, the second meeting of the CTC with international organizations, which will be held on 7 October in Washington, will give further impetus to the strengthening of our joint work. Providing technical assistance to those States that require it must remain one of the key priorities of our anti-terrorist activities. We believe that one way to resolve this issue could be to establish, under United Nations auspices, an international fund to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">As we make the transition from stage B to stage C -- to use the terminology of the CTC -- the Committee must learn to work at variable speeds, taking into account existing differences in national anti-terrorist capabilities. Evening these out will require not only financial resources, but time. Those States that are more advanced, however, must not wait complacently for those lagging behind to catch up. They must be moving forward constantly under the leadership of the CTC, in prompt implementation of all the measures that are called for under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De La Sabliére</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The representative of Italy, who will speak later on behalf of the European Union, will remind the Council of the energetic action being taken by the Union and its member States to combat terrorism, and I would like in advance to associate myself fully with that statement. I would also like, however, to make a few comments in my national capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">First of all, my delegation is gratified by the continuing work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), and in particular of its experts, to whom I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute for their work in evaluating the national reports submitted by States in compliance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The number of reports received has already been mentioned and, as you rightly said, Mr. President, the evaluation of these reports is impressive and unprecedented.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">We must not, however, speak only in terms of quantity. The content of the evaluation letters must be more closely adjusted to the situation in a given country in terms of the measures taken in implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. For those States that have already enacted legislation or set up administrative structures to combat terrorism, the evaluation will apply to the effectiveness of the measures that they have adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Secondly, France fully supports the importance attached by the CTC to the matter of cooperation with international and regional organizations with competence in the field of combating terrorism. It is, indeed, important -- along the lines of the meeting that took place on 6 March -- to intensify that cooperation by taking concrete measures that are better adapted to the competences and capacities of the relevant organizations and in keeping with the priorities established by the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">In this regard, my delegation welcomes the fact that the Committee has sent letters in this respect to some of those organizations. We hope in particular that the cooperation thereby established will enable our Committee and its experts to benefit from the evaluations that the organizations have already carried out or plan to carry out within their area of competence -- both in material and geographical terms -- in the field of combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The second meeting between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and regional and international organizations, which is to be held in Washington on 7 October under the aegis of the Organization of American States, will usefully enable us to pursue and broaden this interesting dialogue in the interest of an expanded and more effective fight against terrorism. We believe it is extremely important for there to be an initial assessment of the cooperation that has been initiated between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and international and regional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Thirdly, France would like to reiterate the essential nature of technical assistance to countries needing help in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. As the Chairman's report points out, efforts already made by the Counter-Terrorism Committee to facilitate technical assistance must be stepped up -- in particular through the register of available sources and the matrix. My delegation therefore supports the idea of giving a more active role to the Committee's experts in this field. We will participate actively in the discussions on this matter in the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">As the representative of the country that currently chairs the G-8, I would also like to say a few words about the establishment of the G-8's Counter-Terrorism Action Group. The Group, which was set up last June during the G-8 summit at Evian, met in Paris for the first time on 2 July. That meeting included the participation of representatives of the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. In close cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Action Group is entrusted with evaluating the needs and priorities of States vis-à-vis technical assistance to combat terrorism and with improving coordination in the activities of its members in this field. The Action Group, which is designed to strengthen global capacity to combat terrorism, will hold its second meeting next October.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">Finally, France is pleased that, based on recent country reports, the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee will inform the Security Council in his next report of the main difficulties encountered by States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Such information, which my Government called for in the Security Council several months ago, will be useful in enabling the Council to better evaluate the follow-up to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> almost two years after its adoption.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Diallo</span> <span class="nation">Guinea</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">This meeting provides Member States with an opportunity once again to voice their views on the thorny issue of terrorism as a threat to international peace and security. I would like to take this opportunity to convey to the President, in his capacity as the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), the appreciation of my delegation for his presentation of the Committee's report and the eighth programme of work, of which we have taken note. I should also say once again how grateful our delegation is to the Chairman, the other members of the Committee and the Committee's support staff for the quality and quantity of work carried out in the area of transparency.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The submission by all Member States of their initial reports is something we should take note of. This substantial work has been made possible thanks, among other things, to the ability and perseverance of the Committee, working through its subcommittees and experts. We must now give further thought to the reasons why some countries are late in submitting their reports, in order that we can come up with appropriate solutions.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">We are pleased with the continued cooperation between the Committee and international, regional and subregional organizations. We hope that the outcome of the follow-up meeting with the Organization of American States, which is to be held in Washington next October, will make it possible to strengthen that cooperation, which is essential to eradicating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The issue of assistance is also a crucial element. Designing a register and matrix in this field is encouraging. However, we must pay more attention to this matter, which means greater involvement by the Committee to ensure better coordination.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">In another area, my delegation would like to emphasize the need to strengthen legislation and national mechanisms and to ratify the various international instruments on terrorism. The welcome increase in countries acceding to those instruments should be followed up. For its part, my country very recently ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">My delegation is more convinced than ever that combating terrorism is a long-term challenge in which success will depend on our continued solidarity. We also note with interest the establishment of cooperation between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, which share many interests. We believe all United Nations terrorism policies should be implemented in a coordinated and consistent manner. In the same vein, it is essential that we harmonize the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee established by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 51/210</a>, the Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Policy Working Group on the United Nations and Terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Finally, I wish to emphasize the success achieved in the context of combating terrorism. That success uniquely illustrates the fact that the international community has the will to live up to its responsibilities. Guinea, which has always opposed terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, will continue to make its contribution to this joint undertaking.</p>

We would like to convey our gratitude to you personally, Mr. President, in your capacity as the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for the great efforts you have made in the last three months. We fully agree with you that the people of your friendly country have faced terrorist attacks for many years and that they have fought terrorism. All of us should make use of the lessons to be learned from your struggle against terrorism. My delegation would also like to express its gratitude to the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee, its experts, members and Secretariat staff for all their efforts to make the work of the Committee a success in the past.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">The CTC was able to fully meet its responsibilities in the period under review. The Committee has worked tirelessly to make progress in enhancing the capacity of Member States to harmonize their national legislation with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. That success is evidenced in the cooperation of Member States vis-à-vis the provisions of the resolution, and especially in the fact that the requisite reports have been provided to the Committee. Every State has now submitted its initial report; 154 States have submitted a second report; and 35 States have presented their third report. I am pleased that Syria is among the 35 countries that have submitted the third report within the time established. That is further demonstration of our seriousness in promoting the international community's efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">The Committee has pursued an open dialogue with Member States in a framework of transparency and has given assistance to those countries that have expressed the need to enhance their capacity to combat terrorism. The Committee has had real interaction with regional and subregional organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">My delegation supports the programme of work for the next 90 days presented by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Syria has cooperated fully with the Committee and would like to reaffirm its willingness to continue to make every effort to carry out that programme of work in order to meet the needs of Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">My delegation commends the Secretariat's efforts in publishing a further page concerning the CTC on the Internet. I would like to stress that there should be complete equality among the six working languages on the Committee's web page.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The danger of international terrorism requires the concerted effort of the members of the international community. That cooperation should not superficial or limited to a set period of time. We would like to affirm what you, Sir, said in your statement a few minutes ago. We would like to seriously examine the roots, reasons and causes of terrorism. We should diagnose the causes of terrorism in order to eradicate it.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">In that context, it is important to define terrorism and to distinguish between it and the right of peoples to liberation, which is a right enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. That right should be safeguarded by everyone. All measures should be taken to ensure that right.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">The adoption by the Security Council of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> was a landmark in the global fight against terrorism. Through it, the international community took the clear stand that the fight against terrorism requires sustained, long-term and global action. The United Nations has a central role to play, and one upon which national efforts should be built, since States have the primary responsibility for adopting measures to fight terrorism and its financing -- measures aimed at suppressing all active and passive support for terrorism. In so acting, States must comply fully with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which established a set of mandatory provisions for all States and which entrusted to the United Nations an effective leading role in this fundamental combat against one of the greatest threats to international peace and security today.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) was established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> as an instrument of the Security Council to promote implementation by Member States of all aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Approaching two years of existence, the Committee has registered the remarkable achievement of securing the cooperation of the entire United Nations membership, thus making, through its work, an important contribution to the global fight against terrorism. In fact, it is undeniable that, thanks to the activity of the CTC, the international community has an enlarged and more effective legal framework for fighting terrorism. It is also undeniable that, because of States' self-assessments through their reports to the CTC, there is a clearer picture of the existing legislation and machinery to prevent terrorism and of the legislative gap that remains to be filled. The creation and revision of legislation by a large number of States, in line with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, has been, indeed, an important accomplishment of the CTC. There is now an urgent need to extend the CTC's assistance to a number of developing countries in order to make international legislation to combat terrorism more global and, especially, more effective.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">The quarterly programme of work of the Committee for the current period provides an overview of adherence to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. The fact that all States have submitted their first report and that a large number have submitted their second and third reports testifies to the universal commitment to the fight against terrorism. The great increase in the number of States that have adhered to the 12 international conventions and protocols related to terrorism is a clear demonstration of the important progress achieved so far.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The complexity of the tasks related to reporting by States will be greater with the stage B reports, which require that States assess police and intelligence structures to detect, monitor and apprehend terrorists, assess customs, immigration and border controls to prevent the movement of terrorists and assess controls preventing access to weapons by terrorists. With the reporting of stage B, the CTC reaches the very core of the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">The work of the independent experts of the CTC has been instrumental to the achievements of the Committee. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to show my appreciation for their commitment and their professionalism. Their contribution to the Committee has been a positive factor.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">Almost 40 Member States are late in submitting their second and third round reports, and all of them are developing countries. That reality shows that it is not an easy task for a large number of countries to comply fully with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. It is not due to lack of commitment or lack of recognition of the importance of the fight against terrorism. It is essentially due to a lack of capacity -- national and regional or subregional -- to meet the resolution's requirements. In fact, a large number of developing countries have enacted anti-terrorist legislation, but their scarce financial, technical and human resources impede the implementation of such a legislative framework. Moreover, those countries lack the capacity to deal adequately with border controls and security, the movement of criminals, the smuggling of illicit drugs, illegal firearms, precious materials and possible links with terrorists. We recognize the need for those countries approach international standards in order to meet the great challenges lying ahead. But to achieve that goal, we need substantial long-term assistance focused on national and regional capacity building in areas related to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Only through concerted efforts and international assistance will we be able to meet the reporting requirements of the CTC and to strengthen our capacity in the fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">We welcome the commitment by the Committee to provide technical assistance to countries in need and the more active approach mentioned in the programme of work of identifying assistance priorities and finding appropriate providers of assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">Before I end, let me make absolutely clear the fact that the Angolan Government condemns the methods and tactics employed by terrorists. The end will never justify the means used by terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">However, I should like to call the attention of the Security Council to the root causes of terrorism. These root causes remain, among others, injustice, extreme poverty, and social and political exclusion. The fight against terrorism should also address its root causes if we are jointly to succeed.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa10">Let me end now by commending you, Sir, for the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which you, as its Chairman, have been guiding. The practical contribution of the independent experts has also been a very important factor, and I think that together we should be able to continue our action and increase our capacity to deal with this major scourge.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Angola for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Muñoz</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset, Sir, to congratulate you for guiding our work in your dual capacity as President of the Council and as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">My country appreciates the useful introduction you gave us in your latter capacity as well as your presentation of the Committee's comprehensive 90-day programme of action.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The Permanent Representative of Peru will be speaking on behalf of the Rio Group, and I shall therefore confine myself to a few brief comments on behalf of my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">I should like to highlight in particular the reference you made, Sir, to the principles of cooperation, transparency and equality that inspire and guide the work of the CTC. It is clear that the Committee is making concrete and effective efforts to apply these principles in every case -- efforts that involve not only the Chairman but also delegations, experts and the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">As has so often been said here in the Council, the international community as a whole is vulnerable to terrorism. Yesterday Spain was struck by terrorist acts, which we deeply condemn and deplore -- not only out of solidarity as a brotherly country, but also because it is our political and ethical duty. Protection therefore cannot be merely unilateral. We must continue our efforts to build a common structure effectively to confront the scourge of terrorism and help all Member States to increase their capacity to prevent terrorism and respond to it.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1373 (2001)</a> set in motion an unprecedented type of cooperation effectively to confront this global threat. I believe that the Committee is at the core of a process of collaboration to which no country can fail to contribute. The new programme of work highlights the fact that what is important is to make progress in terms of concrete measures in order to increase the means available to, and capacities of, all States to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">We welcome also the growing degree of cooperation and the deepening of contacts between the CTC and international, regional and subregional organizations following the special meeting on 6 March last. We welcome in particular the meeting that the CTC will hold in October with international, regional and subregional organizations at the headquarters of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the auspices of the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism. Chile, as a member State of the OAS, is very encouraged and gratified by this level of cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">As regards the reports provided by States to the Committee, the rate of response is highly satisfactory. But going beyond mere figures, what is most satisfying is the ongoing relationship between the CTC and States, which enables them jointly to comply with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in resolving problems that arise.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">The effectiveness of the Committee depends, in the final analysis, on the degree of compliance and on the support of all the States Members of the Organization and of the international organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Finally, I should like, Sir, as Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, publicly to say to you that I intend to continue to promote, through concrete measures, a greater interconnection between the two committees, as provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1455(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1455 (2003)</a>. I believe that I will soon be able to report on the fruitful inception of cooperation between these two committees, which, in the ultimate analysis, endeavour to prevent and, hopefully, to eradicate the scourge of terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. King</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa01">I should like to begin by complimenting you, Sir, on the early months of your chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). We are grateful for what you have done. We endorse the work programme that you have set out for the next 90 days and the principles that guide this. I will associate myself with the statement to be made later this morning by the Italian presidency of the European Union and would like to underline the very considerable efforts that the European Union is making in this field. I will therefore confine myself just to two general points and three more specific ones on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa02">The first general point is that, in many ways, the challenge that the CTC faces is getting increasingly difficult. On the one hand the work is getting more technical and more complex, and, on the other, although the shock remains, the memories of 11 September are inevitably fading.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa03">Progress has been made, of course, since we adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, but there is no doubt that the threat posed by terrorism remains. We must hope that we never confront another event similar to that of 11 September, but we cannot yet say that that possibility is excluded.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa04">Terrorist access to weapons of mass destruction remains a key concern, and we welcome the fact that the CTC has met agencies involved in addressing weapons of mass destruction and that agreement was reached to include this as an issue in the outgoing letters from the CTC. But, and this is the end of my first point, across the board we think that the CTC is going to have to redouble its efforts to maintain momentum. The United Kingdom is ready to offer whatever support it can.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa05">My second general point is the key challenge of keeping the CTC's work operational. It can be a success if, and only if, it makes a real difference on the ground. It is, of course, in all our interests that the CTC remain effective, because that will reduce the scope for atrocities.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa06">We all have a responsibility to ensure that the CTC can be effective by supporting it and fully cooperating with it as it pursues increasingly substantive work.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa07">I have three suggestions about the substantive work for the next period. In making these, I should like to echo others in praising the assistance that the independent experts have provided.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa08">First, the CTC needs to build on its work on assistance. We think that we need to strengthen the expert team in this area. The experts are increasingly identifying areas in which States can benefit from or be able to access help. The CTC and its experts need to be proactive in discussing their conclusions with States concerned, including through direct contact with capitals, whether that is by telephone or by actual visits. They will help States to access the increasingly wide-ranging assistance programmes which are available. A priority in moving forward in this area is sorting out legislation, which needs to be in place before States can move on to other areas.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa09">My second point -- and it is quite closely related -- relates to States that are falling behind on implementation or on cooperation with the CTC, as requested in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>. There is a range of reasons for this, but we see a need for sharper analysis of these reasons and think that the experts must be prepared to advise the CTC and the Council where there are concerns. In our turn, we, the Council, need to be prepared to respond to these points from experts.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa10">My last point is about the need to continue to deepen contacts with other organizations -- a point that several others speakers have already touched on. We have established these contacts with those in other organizations who set the standards, but we hope that the CTC's experts will explore what more could be done to get regional organizations to address terrorism themselves. There was much interest expressed at the 6 March special meeting and we should be prepared to help those organizations for which this is a new agenda item to develop the expertise to take discussion forward. So we look forward to the October meeting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zhang Yishan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I wish to thank you, Sir, for having convened this meeting and for your briefing, in your capacity as the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), on the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">Under your leadership, the work of the CTC over the past three months has made further progress. The CTC has continued actively to review the progress reports submitted by various countries on their implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and has begun its review of stage B implementation in certain countries. The CTC's counter-terrorism assistance has been carried out at a deeper level and, on the basis of the particular situations of various countries, the Committee has made relevant proposals in its draft letters. The CTC has continued to strengthen its cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations. Its Chairman has sent letters to 17 international and regional organizations, in which he has indicated the inter-State areas for cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">We highly appreciate the leadership of Ambassador Arias and the worthy efforts of his colleagues. At the same time, I wish to thank the Vice-Chairmen and the secretariat of the CTC for their work.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">China supports the eighth 90-day programme of work of the CTC. I wish to make two comments on the Committee's future work.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">First, it is important to further strengthen the work being done in counter-terrorism assistance. Practical measures should be taken to ensure that the assistance needs of the many developing countries are met. To that end, the CTC should not only continue to serve as a bridge between recipient and donor countries, but also closely follow the provision of such assistance so that the donors, as proposed by the CTC, can effectively provide assistance to countries in need. The eighth 90-day programme of work includes some very good ideas on counter-terrorism assistance to be provided by the CTC and I hope that action will be taken to turn those ideas into reality.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Secondly, it is imperative that we maintain the leadership of the CTC in the cause of international counter-terrorism. The CTC was established by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and its authority and legitimacy are irreplaceable. While we strive further to strengthen cooperation between the CTC and international, regional subregional organizations, we must ensure the Committee's core position and leadership. International, regional and subregional organizations should work in the spirit of Security Council resolutions fully to support and cooperate with the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">China has always fully supported the global fight against terrorism and the work of the CTC. We will continue in the future to participate constructively and actively in the work of the CTC. I wish to affirm that the Chinese delegation intends to work closely with Ambassador Arias to ensure that the CTC can better serve the international cause of counter-terrorism and the interests of the myriad States Members of the United Nations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tafrov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I should like to thank you, Sir, for having organized this meeting and, in your capacity as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for the programme of work that has been developed under your leadership and which Bulgaria supports wholeheartedly.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">As an associate member of the European Union, my country endorses the statement to be made shortly by the Ambassador of Italy on behalf of the Italian presidency of the Union, an organization that is making a substantial contribution to the fight against terrorism around the world.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Terrorism continues to be an immediate and tangible threat to peace and security throughout the world and to all States without exception. That is why counter-terrorism remains a fundamental priority of Bulgaria's foreign policy. We continue to believe that the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is a priority task for all Members of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">I should like briefly to mention several major vectors for action that we feel should be undertaken by the Committee on the basis of firm and unchanging principles.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">Any counter-terrorism activity, be it at the national, regional or subregional level, should always and fully conform to the norms of international law and respect the principles of human rights and international humanitarian law. Terrorists should not enjoy even a hint of justification for their reprehensible actions. One specific measure that would anchor our fight against terrorism in international law would include, as indicated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the signature or ratification by States of the relevant United Nations conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Paragraph 7 of the work programme of the CTC mentions the fact that, before 11 September 2001, fewer than 12 countries had signed all of the United Nations counter-terrorism conventions, while now, the number of those countries is more than 40. However, that figure should not be overly reassuring to us, because what counts is the implementation of those conventions. Moreover, permit me to mention the fact that Bulgaria not only has signed and ratified the 12 conventions in question, but also has harmonized its national legislation so as to permit their effective implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">International terrorism calls for coordinated action on the part of the international community. On that point, the work being done by the CTC -- and, Mr. President, you have already contributed enormously to the Committee's effectiveness, for which I thank you -- has enabled it to become the heart of the global anti-terrorist effort. It is the reference point of all organizations and States that are active in this area. From that perspective, it is very important that the relations that have developed over time between the CTC and other international organizations be deepened, developed and focused. As a number of previous speakers said, it is very often regional and subregional organizations that have the resources and the means to implement counter-terrorism measures. As far as my country is concerned, Bulgaria is contributing actively to this fight in its subregion of South-Eastern Europe by cooperating with regional European organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">It is very important, in our view, that the competent international organizations include the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the fight against terrorism in order to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorist organizations. The universalization of international conventions and treaties in the area of non-proliferation and disarmament seems to us an essential point. Bulgaria unreservedly supported the changes that have been made to the founding documents of a great number of international export control regimes in order to lessen the danger posed by nuclear, chemical and biological materials.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa09">The fight against terrorism is a challenge requiring long-term stamina. It seems to us that the mechanism that the CTC has represented since its creation has proved itself effective, but obviously -- as Ambassador Thomson said a few moments ago -- we will not really know how effective it is unless our action makes a difference on the ground. The technical assistance that has been provided -- particularly by organizations such as the World Trade Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Monetary Fund and by donor countries -- is of major importance. It is therefore disturbing that there still are some countries that, for objective reasons such as a lack of resources, have yet to undertake adequate measures to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa10">It is true that terrorism is a danger that changes its approach and its complexion and is sometimes very subtle. It is a multiform phenomenon that knows no borders and thus is difficult to deal with. However, Bulgaria is convinced that it can be vanquished. To do that requires the efforts of all States. The Committee that you have the honour to chair, Mr. President, is at the heart of that struggle.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Khalid</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for your briefing on the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). We also appreciate your efforts to maintain and improve the performance of the CTC since assuming the chairmanship in April.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Pakistan shares the international concern about terrorism. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including State terrorism. Decades of exposure to terrorist acts -- which have led to the loss of thousands of innocent lives, including those of our law- enforcement officials -- as well as economic losses, have reinforced our conviction that this problem needs to be tackled resolutely. Accordingly, our counter-terrorism efforts continue apace.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">Since its establishment about two years ago under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, the CTC has made a significant contribution in the field of counter-terrorism. The dialogue it has maintained with Member States and its role in the facilitation of the provision of technical assistance to States have been helpful in enabling them to improve their domestic capacity to counter terrorism. However, the Committee needs to further intensify its efforts to encourage donors to extend technical assistance to States to enhance their capacities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">We appreciate the CTC's efforts to promote transparency and efficiency in its work. Its efforts to improve coordination with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> will further facilitate that process. Its initiatives to enhance coordination with regional and international organizations are also appreciable. In addition, we have noted the CTC's efforts to increase coordination with specialized agencies to counter the threats of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">The fight against terrorism is a long and multifaceted process. The objectives of shielding humanity from threats of terrorism and of strengthening international peace and security can be realized if our efforts address the problem of terrorism in its totality. It is time we move away from mere symptomatic treatment to more basic and structural issues. Issues of socio-economic justice, the rule of law, political freedom and human rights cannot be dismissed as unrelated to the discourse on terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">The denial of basic rights and other prerequisites of a civilized life leads to situations which breed intolerance and extremism. We would be remiss if we did not analyse and address the factors which, if not directly responsible, facilitate the growth of and support for terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Terrorism is an international concern requiring global cooperation. Our vision of security should not, therefore, hinge solely on security within national boundaries, but should also embrace international security. To achieve that, the need to resolve longstanding international disputes cannot be overstated. Similarly, the need for a definition of terrorism that maintains a distinction between the right of people to self-determination and terrorism is even greater today than in the past. Such legal clarity would be extremely useful in providing a legal framework for our common struggle against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">It would be a travesty of justice if we could not protect and uphold the principles of human rights in our fight against terrorism. We should therefore be sensitive to threats emanating not only from individuals and non-State actors but also from States.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">International security would be reinforced by promoting mutual tolerance, cultural diversity and inter-religious harmony. As these elements are essential and indispensable constituents for peace and security, the Security Council should play a leading role to ensure that they are protected and promoted.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pleuger</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">Germany remains fully committed to the fight against terrorism within the broadest possible international coalition.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">We fully subscribe to the statement to be made later by the presidency of the European Union, and I will therefore limit my intervention to three specific points.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">First of all, I would like to thank Ambassador Arias for the able way in which he has maintained and improved, in his four initial months as Chairman, the continuity and momentum of the Counter-Terrorism Committee's efforts. We support the Committee's new work programme in all its aspects. We especially welcome its ever-growing emphasis on technical assistance, and that leads to my second point.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">Germany maintains technical assistance programmes with more than 30 countries worldwide, primarily in the fields of the police, customs, law enforcement and financial law and practice. We are thus responding to the needs of many developing countries, as has been reiterated in today's discussion by our colleagues from Guinea, Angola and China. Together with our partners in these projects, we strive to strengthen the rule of law through efficient judicial and law-enforcement structures. Our common fight must respect national and international law, human rights and the Charter of the United Nations. In our view, the rule of law must always prevail.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">My third point is that we want to draw attention to the plight of the world's least developed countries. Some days ago, the United Nations High Representative for the Least Developed Countries stated that 11 per cent of the world's population live on less than $1 a day. It is obvious that this extreme poverty makes them vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist activists. This is one of the reasons why the fight against poverty, social injustice and other breeding grounds of terrorism must remain high on the international agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">In conclusion, let me assure you, Mr. President, that Germany is determined to remain an active and reliable partner in the international coalition against terrorism, within the framework of the Charter and of international law.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Negroponte</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">We would like, first of all, to congratulate you, Mr. President, as Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), upon the completion of your first three months in the leadership of the Committee. We believe that the transition from the previous chairmanship has been seamless and that through your vigorous and committed leadership and creativity the work of the CTC has continued to progress. Of course, we would also like to thank the Spanish Mission and the members of your dedicated team who have been supporting you in this effort, as well as CTC experts and members of the Secretariat. They deserve our thanks for their ongoing contributions to the CTC's success.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">As we endorse the work programme for the next 90 days, it is worth recalling some of the accomplishments since the CTC was established more than 20 months ago. They include assembling a substantial body of relevant information about worldwide counter-terrorism capacity; maintaining an open-ended and increasingly focused dialogue with Member States about the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>; determining which countries need what counter-terrorism assistance, and helping to match such countries with donors; and acting as coordinator among other international organizations in the field of counter-terrorism, thereby working to raise the capacity of all Member States in this area.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">Perhaps one of the Committee's most important contributions has been to ensure that the issue of counter-terrorism remains high on the Council's agenda. Given the number of important international peace and security issues before the Council, there is a risk that the Council's focus on combating terrorism will not be sufficiently intense. Through its steady work and quarterly briefings to the Council, the Committee has ensured that the Council continues to lead in the worldwide effort to build counter-terrorism capability. However, the Committee has a lot of work ahead of it. For example, while 35 States have become parties to all 12 international conventions and protocols since the Committee began its work -- a very important achievement -- over 150 more still need to do so. Although a number of States have taken strides towards the implementation of different aspects of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, many still do not have adequate legislation in place to combat terrorism -- whether that concerns the regulation of the banking sector, charities, or the monitoring of borders.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">In addition, although all States have submitted a report to the CTC, some of those reports contain little evidence of efforts to implement the resolution, and some States are late in submitting follow-up reports. As long as a few States are not acting quickly enough to raise their capacity to combat terrorism, we all remain vulnerable. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and those that have taken place since then highlight this fact.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">The implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, however, ultimately requires more than submitting reports to the CTC, adopting laws and regulations and putting in place the proper structures to fight terrorism. Implementation of the resolution requires that States apply those laws and regulations and use those structures against all who are suspected of committing terrorist acts, including acts of indiscriminate violence against civilians, regardless of motive or cause. It requires that States cooperate with other States in the apprehension, investigation and prosecution of all suspected terrorists. Those States that do not do all they can to combat terrorism put all States at risk, as the international community's capacity to fight terrorism is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">In short, while the CTC has made important contributions to the fight against terrorism, it still has a lot of work to do in three core areas: reviewing and assessing States' written submissions, facilitating and coordinating counter-terrorism assistance and expanding cooperation with more than 60 international, regional and subregional organizations. In addition to that work, we believe that the Committee, including through its experts, should soon begin to visit capitals that may benefit from a discussion of the matters that need to be tackled to further the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and of the assistance that might be available.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">Given the important work that remains to be done, it is essential that the CTC continue to receive the support of, and cooperation from, Member States and the broader international community it has received so far. In addition, given the CTC's various tasks, it is time to start thinking about how the CTC can best accomplish them. The CTC plays a leading role in building the capacity of all States to fight terrorism. We should seek to ensure that the Committee has what it needs to be as effective as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Aguilar Zinser</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">My delegation is grateful to you, Mr. President, for the work done since your assumption of the Chairmanship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). We would like to associate ourselves with the comments made by the members of the Security Council -- and in particular with those made by the Ambassador of the United States, who preceded me -- in commending the work carried out by the Chairman, his team and the support staff of the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">My delegation associates itself with the statement to be made by the Ambassador of Peru on behalf of the Rio Group. However, I would like to underscore a few points of particular importance to Mexico in the common fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as well as to make some remarks regarding the work of the Committee in the context of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">In the global campaign against terrorism we have had to recognize that terrorism is not an isolated phenomenon. Rather, terrorism is planned and carried out against the backdrop of social conditions, historical conflicts and -- in the current situation in particular -- other activities of organized crime, including the proliferation of, and easy access to, small arms and light weapons. It is for that reason that we believe that, to be effective, our fight against terrorism must be coordinated and comprehensive, both in this and in every other forum. It must also address every relevant aspect and interrelationship of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">My delegation has supported having the United Nations -- and especially the CTC and multilateral bodies -- take full responsibility for adhering to human rights, international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations in carrying out their work. The Committee has taken important steps in that regard by including, without discrimination, a statement in its letters to every State indicating that any measure to combat terrorism must be in line with international humanitarian law, human rights and the specific rights and needs of refugees. In the same vein, the meeting between the CTC and the Vice-Chairman of the Human Rights Committee has been very useful in increasing awareness and exploring possible areas of future action. The Security Council must continue to address this particular aspect. It must also continue to promote the necessary measures to avoid any arbitrary action that could heighten the already terrible impact of terrorism or lead anyone to question the legitimacy of our efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Another important matter that must be dealt with is the issue of access to weapons by terrorists and the opportunities they are provided by legal vacuums and the economic interests of underground producers and dealers. The Committee has begun to look into the transfer of weapons of mass destruction, which is a step Mexico energetically supports. The useful exchange held on 15 May with the organizations mentioned in the report by Ambassador Arias has made it possible for the CTC to begin to call upon States to provide information on legislative measures in force to prevent such types of weapons from falling into the wrong hands. We believe that this topic should be given the necessary priority, while respecting the priorities set out initially by the Committee in order to avoid creating complications in the pace of its work.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">More broadly speaking, we must not forget the daily threat posed by illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons. The recently held Biennial meeting of States to consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action on Small Arms not only demonstrated the growing linkage between those weapons and terrorism, it also pointed to the urgent need to solve both problems comprehensively. We therefore welcome the Committee's decision to take on board Mexico's initiative to put questions to States in the near future concerning the measures they are adopting to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons in line with the United Nations Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">We believe the progress made to strengthen alliances with the competent international, regional and subregional organizations to be positive. Such organizations have served to complement the Committee's work and are designed to further strengthen its efforts. Our delegation would like to be apprised of the outcome of the upcoming high-level meeting between the United Nations and regional organizations, which is to be held on 29 and 30 July, at which international terrorism will be one of the main subjects.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">We recognize the tremendous amount of work carried out by Ambassador Arias and Ambassador Muñoz of Chile to create closer links between the CTC and the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>, concerning Al Qaeda, as well as to clarify existing distinctions between each Committee's mandates and activities. Thanks to that updating effort by both Chairmen, it is clear that the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> is a sanctions enforcement body, whereas the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is geared towards cooperation and facilitating assistance. It is also clear that the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> is the sole body authorized to keep lists. My delegation fully agrees with the comments urging caution made by some members of the Council that, until a satisfactory solution is found in the context of the General Assembly to the matter of a generally accepted definition of terrorism, the Committee established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> must avoid becoming distracted from doing its important work by the drawing up of lists. To that end, we must intensify our efforts in the Sixth Committee to finalize the draft comprehensive convention on terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">Finally, I would like to refer to the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee in facilitating assistance. We recognize the crucial role played by the experts in identifying the needs of Member States in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. We are convinced that in many cases, non-compliance is due to a lack of technical capacity to meet fully the Committee's requirements and to make the necessary changes to national legislation and judicial structures. We hope that the provision of assistance will remain one of the key pillars of the Committee and that the Committee's machinery will be enhanced so that such assistance strengthens national structures, making them capable of preventing and eradicating terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Belinga-Eboutou</span> <span class="nation">Cameroon</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">Like previous speakers, I would like to thank you, Sir, for convening this public meeting. It gives us an opportunity to assess our progress in the implacable fight against the threat that terrorist acts pose to international peace and security. Those acts, which indiscriminately strike individuals and institutions, plunge men, women and children, as well as States into a permanent state of fear.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">In order to be effective, the fight against terrorism must be sustained over a long period of time. It must be founded on a clear, mobilizing strategy based on commitment, solidarity and cooperation among all members of the international community and all the peoples of the United Nations. It requires an ongoing flow of information and an organized exchange of experiences among the various bodies that deal with terrorism. It is fortunate that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, which is our obligatory road map on the issue, responds to those concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">My delegation pays tribute to you, Sir, for the skill, tact and determination with which since April 2003 you have chaired the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which is the principal instrument of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>. Relying on the three Subcommittees and on a team of experienced experts, you continue to carry out the principal tasks assigned to the Committee: to increase the since April 2003 since April 2003 capacity of Member States in their efforts to combat terrorism; to strengthen international cooperation; to update national legal frameworks to combat terrorism; to study the reports on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> that have been prepared by Member States and the relevant international organizations. We welcome the fact that, as of today, more than 385 reports have been evaluated.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">What should we make of the progress of the Counter-Terrorism Committee since its inception? What should we say of its short but rich existence? There are three fundamental areas of action. First, the Counter-Terrorism Committee has enabled almost all members of the international community to become better aware of the extent of the insidious and harmful threat posed by terrorism to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">Secondly, the Committee has become a tool to encourage and to coordinate dynamic cooperation between States and international regional and subregional organizations. It has managed to establish an open and transparent dialogue with all actors in the international community that are involved in combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, it has intensified contacts with international regional and subregional organizations through its periodic meetings. In that context, I welcome the upcoming meeting to be held in Washington on 7 October with international organizations under the auspices of the Organization of American States. Such meetings, which have opened up new prospects for the Committee's involvement, have especially underlined what needs to be done beforehand or simultaneously in order to establish or to build capacity for those actors -- States and international organizations -- that are involved in combating terrorism. We now understand the importance of cooperation and technical assistance, which Cameroon has been consistently calling for. In that context, we believe that the French delegation's proposal for the establishment of a special fund deserves particular attention and reflection.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">In a few months, the Committee will have completed two years of existence. The progress made, of which we have just heard, is certainly cause for admiration, but given the challenges to be confronted, we also need to reflect. How do we adapt our Committee to the real contours of the broader fight against terrorism? How will the Committee ensure compliance with the major directives contained in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1456 (2003)</a>? How do we ensure the implementation of those recommendations that have resulted from the Committee's meetings with other international organizations? Finally, how do we create genuine synergy among Security Council committees whose activities overlap with those of the Counter-Terrorism Committee? The route taken through the contact between the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> is worthy of pursuing. We welcome the statement of commitment to strengthening that cooperation made by my colleague, Ambassador Muñoz of Chile, in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">The new programme of work for the next 90 days, which you, Sir, have just presented to the Council in your capacity as chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, will certainly allow us to complete actions under way by strengthening dialogue and cooperation among the various actors, as well as assistance for the countries that require it. That step is in our interest, and we give it our full support.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Cameroon's commitment to combating, alongside the other members of the international community, the threat to international peace and security posed by terrorist acts, but also by poverty, injustice and intolerance, which are often the root cause of those acts.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">The various reports already submitted by my country are clear testimony of our resolve, which must be fortified by assistance in the area of capacity-building to combat terrorism. Only with this assistance -- the result of unified cooperation -- will Cameroon be able to mesh its efforts with those of the international community to vanquish the scourge of the current century.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">In order to optimize the use of our time, I will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the table. When a speaker is taking the floor, the Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the list at the table.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">I now call on the representative of Italy.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Spatafora</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The acceding countries  Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia;  the associated countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries members of the European Economic Area Iceland and Norway declare that they align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">The European Union unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism as criminal and remains deeply convinced that no terrorism is justifiable, irrespective of its motivations, objectives, forms or manifestation. The European Union, along with all its member States, is strongly committed to defeating this threat, so that succeeding generations can live in a safer and more peaceful world.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">The need to fight against terrorist attacks of all kinds gives us the opportunity strongly to reaffirm the importance we attach to those values which are the cornerstone of the European Union and of the vast majority of the international community: respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, humanitarian law, and the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">We believe that efforts to combat the scourge of terrorism must be conducted in full respect for our common values. In its internal anti-terrorist legislation, the European Union has set high standards for the protection of human rights, which facilitate social consensus and rallying around the cause.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">The European Union recognizes and supports the central role of the United Nations in the fight against terrorism everywhere. In that regard, we wish to reaffirm the high priority attributed by the European Union to the signature and ratification by all member States of the 12 United Nations conventions against terrorism in all its forms. The EU members and the acceding countries are now parties to the vast majority of those conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">We are backing the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) with the same firmness and resolve. The Committee, since it was established under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, has, through its continued and consistent work, provided the international community with a solid, valuable and shared basis to counteract terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1456 (2003)</a> stresses the need for closer cooperation between the CTC and regional and subregional organizations in the fight against terrorism. As we stated in the EU report submitted at the meeting of the CTC with international, regional and subregional organizations that took place in New York on 6 March last, the European Union has introduced a wide range of legislative and political measures in all the areas covered by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">Mr. President, I should like also to commend your able leadership of the Committee and its highly focused and proactive approach, and to say that we strongly support you.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">The European Union works in close coordination with international, regional and subregional organizations and forums supporting and participating in many of the counter-terrorism activities that are carried out within these frameworks. The EU is actively collaborating with the United Nations and its main bodies operating in the field of fighting terrorism and, at the same time, maintains its close cooperation with the relevant United Nations specialized agencies.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">Moreover, with the aim of giving substantive and effective support to third countries in implementing their commitments under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> and other international obligations, the EU has established a strategy for providing those countries with additional and streamlined technical assistance projects. These have been specifically designed to help selected countries to fulfil their obligations under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">The fight against the financing of terrorism remains a top priority for the EU. We have increased our efforts and effectiveness in this field, focusing our attention on cutting financial flows and other forms of support for terrorist organizations. We are committed to strengthening internal procedures in order to prevent groups from obtaining or diverting funds that are directed towards charitable purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa12">Further work has been undertaken as regards the freezing of funds and economic resources in order to prevent terrorism funding. The legislation targeting Al Qaeda and the Taliban has been updated several times so as to bring it in line with the amendments decided by the competent Security Council sanctions Committee, as well as with the exceptions foreseen in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1452(2002).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1452 (2002)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa13">The EU believes that special attention should be devoted to the possible links between terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking. We have to be aware that terrorist organizations may exploit migration flows in order to penetrate borders and disseminate their members so as to implement their criminal plans. A specific Council decision has been adopted to address these problems by stressing the need for simultaneous investigation.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa14">The EU also recognizes the role of the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the Centre for International Crime Prevention in strengthening the capabilities of the United Nations in the prevention of terrorism and to offer advice on the implementation of both the pertinent Security Council resolutions and the United Nations legal instruments against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa15">As is stated in the conclusions reached at the European Council in Thessalonica, the European Union is fully aware that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The acquisition of weapons of mass destruction or related materials by terrorists would represent an additional threat to the international system with potentially uncontrollable consequences.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa16">The EU is committed to further elaborating, before the end of the year, a coherent strategy to address the threat of proliferation, and to continuing to develop and implement the EU action plan as a matter of priority. Our starting point will be a comprehensive and regularly updated threat analysis. Our approach will be guided by our commitment to uphold and implement multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements; our support for the multilateral institutions charged, respectively, with verifying and upholding compliance with those treaties; our commitment to strong national and internationally coordinated export controls; and, finally, our commitment to cooperate with the United States and other partners that share our objectives.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Italy for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">I now call on the representative of Japan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haraguchi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">It has been observed repeatedly that, as technology advances and globalization continues, international terrorism becomes even more immense a threat to international peace and security, for the following reasons.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">First, terrorism is an attempt to materialize terrorists' aims by creating terror and fear and is thus completely incompatible with the principal purpose of the United Nations, that is to say, the establishment of a fair and decent world based on the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">Secondly, terrorists not only threaten the world through terrorism itself but also jeopardize the attainment of a civilized order by engaging in and promoting the illicit trafficking of drugs and the export of arms for the purpose of acquiring funds and means.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">Thirdly, as the notion of deterrence is basically ineffective in preventing terrorism, the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by terrorists, once accomplished, will lead to the unimaginable horror of the disaster caused by the use of such weapons. We must therefore resolutely take action against terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">There has been a series of terrorist incidents recently in countries such as Morocco, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Yemen. Much remains to be done, despite the tremendous efforts made so far by the international community. It is therefore now more important than ever for all members of the international community to show the political will to take forceful counter-terrorism measures and to have the capacity to implement them. As for the matter of political will, many countries have expressed their resolve with respect to this issue on numerous occasions, but those nations also need to give substance to their words by taking actions, such as becoming parties to all of the counter-terrorism conventions and protocols.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">Concerning capacity, it is becoming increasingly more important that assistance for capacity-building be extended to developing countries and Japan greatly appreciates the clearing-house function performed by the CTC in this regard. Information and knowledge accumulated through the assistance matrix and the exchange of letters between the CTC and Member States are very useful tools in promoting international counter-terrorism capacity-building and we welcome the current 90-day work programme of the CTC, expressing its intention to further strengthen such efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">Japan more than once has stressed that, in combating terrorism, it is essential, first, to deny terrorists the means to commit terrorist acts by preventing the financing of terrorism and denying access to false documents, such as passports, and to weapons; secondly, to deny terrorists safe haven and ensure that they are prosecuted or extradited for prosecution; and thirdly, to overcome vulnerability to terrorism by enhancing domestic security measures and crisis -- and consequence-management capabilities. The importance of these measures was confirmed in the G8 action plan adopted on the occasion of the G8 Evian summit held in June. The G8 countries have established the Counter-Terrorism Action Group (CTAG) in order to assist the CTC pursuant to the action plan, and the Group has already embarked on its activities. Japan, as a member of the G8 and CTAG, continues to cooperate in the activities of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">Japan is also accelerating efforts at bilateral cooperation in combating terrorism. The Russian Federation-Japan Consultation on Counter-Terrorism, held on June 23 and 24 in Moscow; the Indonesia-Japan Joint Announcement on Fighting against International Terrorism, issued on June 24; and the Australia-Japan Joint Statement on Cooperation to Combat International Terrorism, released last week, are indicative of such cooperation and we remain committed to working towards capacity-building in the Asia-Pacific region, in particular through similar cooperative efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">Combating terrorism is a difficult task involving an invisible enemy, but "invisible" does not necessarily mean "invincible". The international community must continue to make an all-out effort to create a world order that will preclude all terrorist acts.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gillerman</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of July and to express our appreciation for the leadership of the Council by your predecessor.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">Israel would also like to pay tribute to you for your stewardship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) since your assumption of the chairmanship this past April. The CTC, under your leadership, continues to assume a vanguard role in the global campaign against terrorism and in assisting and monitoring State implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Israel knows, maybe better than any other country, that there can be no peace with terror, and it is our very commitment to peace that binds us to the war against terrorism. In light of our unique experience, Israel stands ready and willing to continue to share its knowledge and expertise and to collaborate in joint efforts aimed at coordinating and strengthening our collective response.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">New security challenges have thrust counter-terrorism to the top of the international agenda and we are now at a critical stage in our actions to enhance international cooperation to prevent and eradicate acts of terrorism. The fundamental need to combat this menacing issue, as terrorists continue to pursue their goal of creating world instability, has indeed become a task that unites us all.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">On the streets of New York and Washington, D.C., on 11 September 2001, and on the streets of Mombassa, Kenya; Karachi, Pakistan; Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, we have witnessed how the winds of hatred and incitement can fan the flames of terrorism, igniting violence and inflicting scars of grief on the families of the victims. No part of the world is immune from the scourge of this global threat -- this plague, cultivated by the support, inaction and complicity of regimes.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">We need an international partnership -- a common resolve and a common purpose in the face of a threat that renders all of us vulnerable. Every nation that seeks peace faces a common enemy today in global terror. We must make it known: When you deliberately attack civilians, you are at war with the entire international community. Anything less than total cooperation by all States in international efforts to counter terror is unacceptable. Zero tolerance for terror is the only moral option.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">The weakest link in our fight against terrorism are those regimes which are able but unwilling to take the necessary actions to put an end to the terrorist activity on their own soil -- the regimes that turn a blind eye to the continuation of arms trafficking, financing and recruitment to further their own agenda. Regimes cannot publicly endorse peace while privately condoning terror. We must hold States accountable for criminal acts committed by terrorists operating from their own territory.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">Similarly, just as States cannot tolerate the practice of terror within their own borders, States cannot be expected to turn a blind eye when their citizens are attacked. States have not only the right, but also the duty to protect their citizens against the threat of terror. We have no greater responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">Our renewed vigour in the wake of 11 September and strategic changes in the international landscape have created an opportunity to pursue peace, democratization and the complete elimination of terrorism. That opportunity must not be missed. In the Middle East, a part of the world where terrorism has had devastating effects, there is a real chance for marked improvements in the international security situation, but we must be rigorous and we must be uncompromising in our war to eliminate the terror weapon.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa10">There can be no genuine ceasefire among organizations committed to the murder of innocents in the pursuit of a fundamentalist agenda. A promise to temporarily halt such brutal attacks is not a concession to be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations. Terrorism is always illegitimate and we cannot lend legitimacy to these repugnant tactics or give these organizations an opportunity to regroup under the protective cover of hollow words. Ceasefires are not and can never be a substitute for dismantling the terrorist infrastructure in accordance with international obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa11">But time is not abundant as we face this imminent threat. The prominent Jewish-American comedian Milton Berle once said, "A committee is a group that keeps minutes and loses hours." We must not become such a committee. We must serve as a springboard for action. As we debate, innocent lives are at stake. Mr. President, Israel welcomes your efforts as Chairman to transition the CTC into an operative mode in order to better combat this threat, and we are prepared to expand our existing bilateral and multilateral activities to strengthen both political will and practical capabilities on the ground to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa12">Terrorism subsists in a webbed infrastructure of evil, and it is time that we untangled that encroaching web. The international community must step up its efforts to prevent terrorist attacks with an eye towards immediate stability and peace-building in the long term. In the short term, we must act to close formal and informal funding channels, put a stop to money-laundering and drugs, and prevent access to illegal weapons, as well as delegitimizing those regimes that provide safe havens for terrorists. It is untenable that certain countries should continue to enjoy the fruits of international legitimacy while they actively pursue policies designed to undermine peace and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa13">As we have stated before, we also believe that a greater effort should be made by the counter-terrorism community in combating the education infrastructure that breeds incitement to hatred and violence. We must ensure that information in the media and in educational, religious and political institutions is used to promote progress and tolerance, knowledge and understanding, and not as a tool to subvert them.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa14">No baby is born wanting to be a suicide bomber. Terrorism is not instantaneous or accidental; it is nurtured over time. If the education of our future generations is left in irresponsible hands, we may sow the seeds of destruction as we wage war against terrorism in other realms. If incitement is not eliminated, it will be impossible to move away from terror and violence to the path of dialogue and the building of a better future.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa15">Disentangled from that web of hate, the terrorists themselves must be stopped and brought to justice. In the Talmud, Rav Muna said, "Where justice is done, truth is done and peace is made. Every place there is justice, there is peace." With the strong arm of the international community, the terrorists must be disarmed. And, with the unwavering strength of moral clarity, the terrorists and their supporters must be named and shamed. We will see no end to terror unless we go after the terrorists. If we only go after the terrorists and their supporters and do not address the structures and foundations of evil, then we will never achieve true peace and coexistence.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa16">The challenge of combating terrorism is especially great because terrorists are cunning in their ability to develop innovative new techniques and to exploit technologies to achieve their aims. One such new threat should be of alarming concern to anyone who flies in a commercial airliner. The dire threat posed by man-portable air defence systems -- also known as MANPADs -- also requires intensive cooperation and coordination of the international counter-terrorism community. On 13 December 2002, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1450(2002).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1450 (2002)</a> condemned, in the strongest terms, the terrorist bomb attack on Arkia Israeli Airlines in Kenya. Subsequent warnings of planned attacks involving shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles capable of destroying civilian aircraft at low altitudes underscore the necessity of States to take urgent action to curb the proliferation of those weapons and the access of terrorist groups to them. As the CTC reviews its work during the past three months and consolidates its agenda for the near future, Israel strongly suggests redoubling efforts to combat the threat of MANPADs -- both strengthening countermeasures and reducing the danger of proliferation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa17">Our international security is similarly hinged on the threat of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists. That horrific nightmare is perhaps more imaginable today than it has ever been. Implementing initiatives to halt the illicit transfer and proliferation of these weapons and setting standards for their import and export will provide safeguards to ensure that no weapon of any magnitude can be supplied to clients who in turn may transfer them to terrorists. On several occasions, Israel has expressed its growing concern that such transactions could generate an enormous humanitarian problem and could have an unspeakable impact upon all levels of society. For Israel, it is self-evident that the international fight against terrorism must begin at home: it can succeed only if every individual State makes a sincere commitment to prevent terrorists from obtaining weapons of mass destruction, MANPADs and other arms. That is vital to international security and vital to our future.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa18">Terrorism not only destroys those who practice it, but ultimately ravages the innocents in society. Poverty does not breed terror; it is terror that breeds poverty and instability. But with the eradication of this threat, we can open the darkest corners of the world to the hope of a better future. Freed from the shackles of terrorism and dictatorial rule, any society can prosper and live in peace with its neighbours. It is our hope that, when the international community makes a determined commitment to end violence and hateful incitement and to fight terrorism wherever it breeds, we will be able to realize that dream.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of the Republic of Korea. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kim</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by expressing my congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency. Speaking before the Security Council for the first time since my official accreditation to the United Nations - it was just last Friday - I can assure you that my delegation will continue to extend its full and active support to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">In the light of the progress that has been made in the field of counter-terrorism, my Government believes that <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> has garnered renewed significance as a legally binding and universally applicable framework. Given the global nature of terrorist threats, we value the crucial role of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in ensuring the national counter-terrorism preparedness of each and every member of the international community. The CTC has demonstrated remarkable competence in addressing potentially weak links in our united efforts to prevent and combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">I now turn to the CTC's latest quarterly work programme (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-710.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/710</a>). While fully supporting the programme of work, the Republic of Korea would like to share some of its observations.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">First, we note that the CTC has now received national reports from all 191 Member States. That is a long overdue but certainly welcome development. Since the reports are highly diverse in their stages and in their focus, we believe that careful consideration should be given to country-specific realities. For its part, the Republic of Korea submitted its third report to the CTC last May.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">Secondly, my Government commends the progress made in the legal and legislative aspects of international efforts to counter terrorism. The Republic of Korea is currently a party to 10 of the 12 terrorism-related international conventions and protocols. Having already signed the remaining two, we are expediting the process of enacting the necessary domestic legislation for early ratification, preferably before the end of this year.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">Finally, my Government expressed its interest in the matter of assistance at the Security Council meeting on the CTC held in April. I am pleased to report to the Council that we have since begun to offer training programmes in airport and seaport security and customs services. We are also planning to provide training courses in the area of cyber-terrorism in the coming months.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Peru. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Doig</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Peru has the honour to speak on behalf of the countries members of the Rio Group: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Venezuela and my own country, Peru.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">The Rio Group welcomes this open meeting of the Security Council on the report of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), and once again reiterates its complete repudiation of terrorism and its support for the work of the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">Since the previous open meeting on this subject, which was held on 4 April, there have been two regional developments that the Group would like to emphasize, as they confirm the progress of our nations' commitment to combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">The first was the declaration of the heads of State or Government of the Rio Group, made during its seventeenth annual Summit, held on 23 and 24 May in Cusco, Peru, in which they reaffirmed their strongest condemnation of terrorism, which is a threat to peace and security, to the effective enforcement of the rights of all individuals and to democratic stability. Similarly, they emphasized the need to continue to work to combat terrorism, particularly in relation to the global problem of drugs and related crimes, and underlined the fact that the fight against terrorism should be carried out with full respect for international law and human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">In that context, the heads of State or Government defined, in what has become known as the Cusco Consensus, the following action: the strengthening, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> of cooperation among our authorities in the fight against terrorism and its relationship to illicit drugs, money laundering and illegal arms trafficking, while increasing information exchanges with a view to preventing terrorist acts and suppressing their financing.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">The other development was the entry into force, on 10 July, of the Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism. That multilateral instrument was adopted by the States members of the Organization of American States in June 2002. Its entry into force commits the nations that have already ratified it to preventing, combating and eradicating the financing of terrorism and to effectively cooperating among themselves to combat that scourge.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">Those developments highlight the fact that the policies that the countries of the region have been developing for a number of years are ongoing and are being intensified, as the Security Council is aware. The steadfast support of our countries for the work of the CTC is the result of such policies. All of the States members of the Rio Group have sent their first two reports to the CTC. To date, some members have already delivered their third explanatory report at the request of the Committee, while others are preparing theirs.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">These national reports contribute to the work of the Committee in its important endeavours to harmonize and implement anti-terrorism measures and to put in place practical mechanisms for international cooperation to combat such criminal activity. This work is sustained through the commitment of all the States Members of the United Nations, which is indispensable if the international community is to confront terrorist threats and related crimes with the required courage and strict respect for the rule of law. In this context, we support the effective application of the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">The Rio Group also highlights the fact that, in the programme of work for its eighth work programme, the Committee should continue to work to identify the assistance and cooperation requirements of countries; develop a global information network against terrorism and modernize the electronic web site of the Committee; and promote universal participation in the 12 international conventions and protocols to combat terrorism. In that connection, the Rio Group expresses once again its interest in completing the strengthening of the international legal anti-terrorism framework, and we hope that a general convention against terrorism will soon become a reality. We hope for similar success with regard to the draft convention on the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism and the review of the International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">Finally, the Rio Group expresses its satisfaction with the fact that, as you pointed out, Mr. President, the next meeting of the Committee with international, regional and subregional organizations will be held in October at the headquarters of the Organization of American States, in accordance with the suggestion of the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism. We are confident that that meeting will facilitate the follow-up, deepening and expansion of the areas of cooperation between international and regional organizations in the fight against terrorism.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kuchinsky</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">I would like at the outset to thank the delegation of Spain for organizing today's debate and providing an opportunity for my Government to present its views on this subject, which is of particular importance to all of us. I would like to express our gratitude to you, Mr. President, in your capacity as the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), for a very informative briefing on the activities of the Committee and for sharing with us your plans for future work.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">The issue of combating terrorism remains a top priority on the agenda of the international community and of this Organization. As the major threat to international peace and security requires sustained, long-term and global action, the Security Council continues to play the central role in facilitating cooperation between Governments to fight terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">The Council has set up the necessary framework for a global response to international terrorism and the strengthening of the potential of the international anti-terrorism coalition. It is now important that the capacity of each nation's legislation and executive machinery be improved so as to achieve tangible results in fighting this scourge. Every Government has the responsibility of analysing anti-terrorism capabilities and identifying areas for improvement. Every State must ensure full and consistent implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions and international treaties.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">The CTC has established a constructive dialogue with Member States in the sphere of developing their national legislation and combating terrorist financing. The delegation of Ukraine greatly appreciates the efforts of the Committee to achieve maximum efficiency, transparency and cooperation with all Member States, including through the communication by the Committee of regular information on its activities. In our view, it would also be worthwhile to consider the CTC's conducting, with the participation of its highly qualified experts, a meeting with Member States to discuss the difficulties or problems most often encountered in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, as reflected in the national reports submitted to the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">Among the achievements of the Committee outlined by its Chairman, I would like to underline its endeavours to provide all possible assistance to the multinational antiterrorist coalition by strengthening the capacities of regional organizations and groups. The Council's meeting on 6 March with representatives of such organizations demonstrated the great potential that exists in this sphere. We welcome the idea of holding yet another meeting this October at the headquarters of the Organization of American States. A regular exchange of opinions and information between representatives of organizations at different forums will definitely benefit the global anti-terrorist struggle.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">Terrorists are using new and sophisticated means to commit their hideous acts. One can imagine the consequences if they were to get hold of weapons of mass destruction -- whether nuclear, chemical or biological. Ukraine agrees with the several delegations that have mentioned that the problem of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies requires special priority. I therefore welcome the efforts of the Committee to address this concern by holding a meeting on 15 May with the representatives of specialized agencies dealing with those specific issues.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">In fact, we have to deprive terrorists of all the means necessary to carry out their activities. In that connection, I would like to bring another issue to the Council's attention, namely, the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which has already been mentioned by the representative of Mexico. Much has been done on the global level to combat such illegal activity, which is directly linked to drug trafficking, transnational organized crime and terrorism. At the same time, as is clearly shown in the report of the Monitoring Group established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1363(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1363 (2001)</a>,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg023-bk02-pa08">"al-Qa'idah, the Taliban and their associated terrorist groups are still able to acquire adequate quantities of weapons and explosives where and when they need them." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2003-669.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/669</a>, para. 89</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">The international community should therefore be more active in preventing the transfer of those weapons to criminals and terrorists and to ensure that they are not diverted to illicit commerce.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">Ukraine has consistently supported the concerted efforts by the United Nations to eradicate the scourge of terrorism. My country has established a comprehensive national system to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Most recently, in March, the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, adopted a law on combating terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">As a party to all 12 anti-terrorist international instruments of universal character, Ukraine is also strengthening cooperation to combat terrorism at the regional level. In October 2002, Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers approved an agreement on cooperation between the GUUAM Participating States -- Azerbaijan, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, Uzbekistan and Ukraine -- taking part in the fight against terrorism, organized crime and other dangerous types of crimes. Firm positions on the issues of combating terrorism and other challenges to international security were reiterated by the Participating States at the recent GUUAM summit, in July at Yalta, Ukraine.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">Let me stress that winning the fight against terrorism will involve a long-term commitment. In that regard, I would like to pay tribute to you, Mr. President, as the Chairman of the CTC, as well as to the members of the Committee, for your tireless efforts and commendable achievements. The work of the CTC represents a great contribution to our common efforts.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Ukraine for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jenie</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">Let me take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation for the convening of this open meeting of the Security Council to review the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) in the last three months. We would also like to pay tribute to Ambassador Inocencio Arias, who has demonstrated effective leadership in steering the CTC, as well as to thank the Vice-Chairmen, the members of the Committee and all the experts involved for their dedication and hard work.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">We take note of the Committee's eighth ninety-day work programme, which will run from 1 July to 30 September 2003. It is our belief that it will continue to enhance the effectiveness of our counter-terrorism measures.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">In that connection, ASEAN supports measures intended to enhance the counter-terrorism capability of States requesting aid. We also reiterate the importance of cooperation and coordination among United Nations Member States in the area of capacity building vis-à- vis States needing assistance, including States in the South-East Asian region.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">Allow me to provide an update on ASEAN's continuing efforts to combat international terrorism since April 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">ASEAN continues to condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We emphasize the need to address the root causes of terrorism, and we reject any attempt to associate terrorism with any religion, race, nationality or ethnic group. That stance was reiterated during the ministerial meeting in Phnom Penh on 16 and 17 June 2003. During that meeting, ASEAN Foreign Ministers expressed their satisfaction with current counter-terrorism measures and reviewed the intensified cooperation that exists between member States, which has facilitated the arrest of persons engaged in terrorist activities and helped to prevent the occurrence of terrorist acts. While renewing the regional resolve to pursue the purposes of the declaration on terrorism issued at the eighth ASEAN summit on 3 November 2002, the Foreign Ministers also affirmed their commitment to continue working with ASEAN law enforcement authorities to carry out the specific measures set out in the ASEAN Declaration on Joint Action to Counter Terrorism, which was issued in November 2001, as well as in the work programme adopted by the special ASEAN ministerial meeting on terrorism held in May 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">Furthermore, within the context of more effectively combating global terrorism, ASEAN Foreign Ministers welcomed efforts towards, and renewed their determination to enhance, cooperation with the international community. They also welcomed the results of the International Conference on Anti-Terrorism and Tourism Recovery, which was held in Manila in November 2002; the Regional Conference on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, held in Bali in December 2002; and the Inter-sessional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime of the ASEAN Regional Forum, held in Karambunai, Malaysia, in March 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">Additionally, the issue of transnational crime was addressed on several occasions. The Foreign Ministers recognized the successful outcomes of the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime (SOMTC) as well as the first ever SOMTC+3 and SOMTC+1 meetings with China, the European Union and the United States, which were held from 9 to 13 June in Hanoi. Also, the fifth meeting of the ASEAN law ministers, held in Bangkok in June 2002, underlined the importance of enhancing linkages with, and supporting, the ASEAN ministerial meeting on transnational crime in preventing and combating transnational crime. The next ASEAN ministerial meeting on transnational crime will be held in Bangkok from 10 to 14 January 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">Furthermore, ASEAN member States look forward to enhancing their capacity to fight terrorism and therefore underscore the importance of implementing the undertakings and commitments outlined in the ASEAN-United States joint declaration of 1 August 2002, the ASEAN-China joint declaration of 4 November 2002 and the ASEAN-European Union joint declaration issued on 28 January 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">In recognition of the necessity of developing further measures for effective crossborder cooperation against transnational organized crime and terrorism, a meeting of Attorneys General of interested regional countries was held in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, from 30 June to 2 July 2003, to discuss means of enhancing cooperation in dealing with such criminal matters.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">In addition to the regional initiatives just mentioned, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) continues to play a key role in enhancing counter-terrorism among the ARF participants, as reflected in the discussions at the official level and in the series of counter-terrorism workshops conducted under its auspices.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">In order to coordinate and to give greater focus to ARF counter-terrorism efforts, an Inter-Sessional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime was held for the first time in Karambunai, Malaysia, on 21 and 22 March 2003. The meeting adopted the statement on ARF cooperative counter-terrorist actions on border security, which outlines various concrete and cooperative measures to strengthen security at their borders. The statement was adopted by the tenth ARF ministerial meeting in Phnom Penh on 18 June 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa13">The ARF remains fully committed to strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation among ARF participants. Gratified by the outcome and conduct of the Inter-Sessional Meeting on Counter-Terrorism and Transnational Crime, the ARF agreed that the Inter-Sessional Meeting should continue its work and welcomed the offer of the Philippines and Russia to co-host it in the next inter-sessional year.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa14">ASEAN Foreign Ministers welcomed the establishment of the Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism in Kuala Lumpur, which was officially launched on 1 July 2003. The centre's emphasis is on creating public awareness through conferences, seminars, sustained education programmes, training on terrorism and counter-terrorism measures, as well as the management of post-terrorism consequences, including those involving chemical, nuclear, and biological warfare.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Butagira</span> <span class="nation">Uganda</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">Since I am taking the floor for the first time as the newly appointed Ugandan Ambassador to the United Nations, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. I also congratulate you on your wise stewardship of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC).</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">Who is a terrorist? In our view, a terrorist is someone who uses indiscriminate violence by not differentiating between armed forces and civilians, between combatants and non-combatants.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">Terrorism in all its manifestations has become a threat to the well-being of mankind. It knows no boundaries. It is naïve to think that one is not immediately affected by acts of terrorism in another country because that country is far from one's own borders. There is spillover. Tourism is affected. The economy takes a nosedive. Jobs are lost. The energies that would be harnessed to advance science and technology for the benefit of humankind are instead diverted towards devising measures to fight terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">All countries should therefore pool their efforts to fight the menace of terrorism. An array of techniques can be employed in this fight: education, for instance, can inform would-be terrorists that carrying out a suicide bombing will not take them to heaven. Good deeds can take one to heaven, and in this regard, the religious leaders of the world have a positive role to play. But in some circumstances, it might be necessary to resort to force to deal with terrorists and their sponsors, be they individuals or countries.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">In Uganda, we have experienced terrorism of a horrendous kind. A group of terrorists led by Joseph Kony has for a long time terrorized northern Uganda. Since 1986, a total of 25,000 children have been abducted. They have been maimed. Women and girls have been raped. Sometimes, human beings have been cooked and eaten. Just a few days ago, 45 children were drowned by these terrorists. More often than not, these terrorists have their bases and safe havens in neighbouring countries. Those countries must be made to realize that it does not pay to harbour terrorists. The international community should therefore hold them accountable. We call for international cooperation in eliminating this menace. We call on the Security Council in particular and the international community in general, to make available resources to dismantle those bases, wherever they are. Those fanatical terrorists have no political agenda to advance beyond primitive barbarity.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">In the fight against terrorism, we should also look at the underlying causes. While poverty per se may not cause individuals to resort to terrorism, it may provide an environment in which terrorism flourishes. Hence, poverty eradication, as emphasized in the Millennium Development Goals, should feature prominently in the fight against terrorism. Good governance, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms should be the goals that countries pursue and implement so that there is no pretext for some people to resort to violence because they are denied those basic rights.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">The threat posed by terrorist acts to international peace and security is real. Member States should work together to eliminate that threat. Uganda will continue to support the Security Council, especially the work of the CTC and the international community, in order to fight and defeat terrorism in whatever form or guise it may appear.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">In Uganda, we are putting in place mechanisms to fight terrorism, and we need support, both technical and financial, to implement and consolidate those mechanisms.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa01">I now call on the representative of Colombia to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Giraldo</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">Colombia fully endorses the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Peru on behalf of the Rio Group. We also thank the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Spain, Inocencio Arias, for the submission of his first report as chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">While we recognize the progress made in the programme of work of the CTC during its eighth programme of work, the Government of Colombia has decided to speak in this open debate of the Security Council because it considers that the Committee and the Council must engage in other initiatives related to this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">Some of those were raised before the Council on 6 May by the President of the Government of Spain, José Maria Aznar. We would like to highlight first of all the fact that all types of terrorism, in whatever form or manifestation they may appear, constitute a single phenomenon, and that all of them, whether domestic or international, must be rejected and fought to the same degree and with the same resolve. Things cannot be otherwise, for this phenomenon is a challenge to the democratic principles of respect for life and the fundamental freedoms of the human being, so deeply cherished by our peoples and by this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">Furthermore, every type of terrorism can become a threat to international peace and security. Let us not forget that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand -- an act of domestic terrorism carried out for internal policy reasons within the Austro-Hungarian Empire -- was the spark that ignited the First World War.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">Another initiative that deserves serious consideration is the possibility for the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Security Council to draw up a general list of international terrorist organizations worldwide, similar to the one kept by the Committee established pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1267(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1267 (1999)</a> for Al Qaeda and the Taliban. We do not believe that a formal definition of terrorism is a prerequisite to devise such a list; indeed, such a definition has not been achieved in more than 30 years.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa06">Whoever carries out criminal acts for political purposes, intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public", as stated in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-60.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 49/60</a>, is a terrorist, whatever his or her motivation. We must once and for all relieve the topic of terrorism of its political connotations, so as to be able to combat it throughout the world for what it is: a serious crime against life and the freedom of individuals, and a grave threat to civilization.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa07">Finally, although <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1373 (2001)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1456(2003).pdf" class="pdf">1456 (2003)</a> enabled the Security Council to express its concern about the close linkage between terrorism, organized transnational crime, the use and trafficking of illicit drugs, money laundering and traffic of illegal weapons, the Council and the Committee must deepen their consideration of these linkages. This is essential if we bear in mind that the controls imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> on the financing of terrorist acts must be successful, for terrorists will increasingly have recourse to these types of crimes in order to fund their activities.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa08">Acts of terrorism must be characterized not only by where they are committed or by their global or national scope, but also in terms of the origin of the phenomena behind them and that of the funds that are used. It has been proved that the international financial networks used by terrorists are similar to those that underpin trafficking in illegal drugs and illegal weapons. That is why Colombia stresses the urgent need to take a direct approach to combating terrorism and related crime on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa09">In reiterating our support for the work being carried out by the Council and its Counter-terrorism Committee in fighting this universal scourge, I should like to reiterate our appeal to the international community to cooperate with respect to the legislative and political activities required under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> in order successfully to combat terrorism. In this field of international cooperation, the United Nations has the capacity, the experience and the moral authority to assist all regions of the world affected by the scourge of terrorism.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">I now call on the representative of Nepal.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sharma</span> <span class="nation">Nepal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa01">I wish at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this public meeting to discuss threats to international peace and security posed by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa02">This meeting could not be timelier. Today terrorism is the gravest threat to international peace and security. It has spared no country, rich or poor, large or small. Most nations have suffered the consequences of this senseless scourge. Combating terrorism should be the top priority of the international community in its quest for peace.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa03">Terror invites conflicts and brings swift decay to society. It breeds political uncertainty, disrupts economic progress, undermines human rights and freedoms, and spawns social discontent. Experience has taught us that terrorists in one country may force the entire region and the world into an ugly conflict by using other countries as the staging ground to advance their agenda of destruction. In this sense, terrorism frays the very fabric of our international society.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa04">Nepal strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We have always been committed to combating terrorism. Our firsthand experience with this indiscriminate and ruthless crime has further reinforced our resolve. Consistent with this, Nepal has already promulgated a stringent and broad-based law that responds to our specific needs and to our international obligations. Legal, institutional and administrative measures are being strengthened to prevent acts of terrorism and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa05">As terrorism has a global reach, sustained regional and global efforts will be critical to combat the toxin of terrorism. Nepal has been working with other countries in the South Asia region and in the wider world, sharing intelligence, tracking the movement of suspected terrorists, stifling their financial flows and frustrating their communications to the best of our limited capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa06">The United Nations provides a common platform for our shared endeavour to promote joint action and coordination in our fight against terrorism. The 12 international conventions and various relevant resolutions constitute that platform. Among them, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)</a> is one of the most powerful arrows in the quiver of the United Nations to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa07">Indeed, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> -- adopted in the wake of terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001 -- marks a watershed in our collective endeavour to stamp out terrorism from the face of the earth. The Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) established under that resolution has proved itself to be an effective instrument to advance our common goal.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa08">Nepal expresses its appreciation to the CTC for its good work and for the positive approach it has embraced, and it pledges its continued support. Mr. President, we also applaud your effective leadership of the CTC.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa09">Now that it has collected substantive information and identified the gaps, the CTC should pay more attention to ensuring financial, technical and legal assistance to the needy countries, so that infrastructure critical to attaining the goals of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a> could be put in place in those countries.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa10">Counter-terrorism assistance, now available from different sources, needs to be consolidated and disbursed from one window in order to ensure easier access and greater impact. To make this happen, the Security Council should create an anti-terrorism fund, to be administered by one of the existing United Nations mechanisms. Meanwhile, the world community must speed up the process of finalizing the international convention against terrorism that has been under negotiation for the past several years.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk03-pa11">Before closing, I must underline that the world community should address the root causes of terrorism, not just its symptoms, which, unfortunately, receive more attention and resources. Terrorists often use poverty as their breeding ground. The world community must deny them that ground by reducing poverty and by addressing structural anomalies in national and global economies. Only a reduction in abject poverty, accompanied by growth with equity, will help us put the genie of terrorism into the bottle.</p>
