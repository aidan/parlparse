	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on Somalia, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-977.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/977</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council takes note of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on Somalia (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-977.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/977</a>) and briefings by the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Security Council, appalled by the killing near Baidoa on 22 August of seven Indian soldiers and the wounding of nine more serving with UNOSOM II, strongly condemns the premeditated attack on United Nations peace-keepers who were providing essential support and assistance to the humanitarian effort of the international community in Somalia carrying out the mandate of the Security Council. The Council expresses its condolences to the Government of India and the families of the soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in assisting the people of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Council expresses grave concern regarding the deteriorating security situation in Somalia and deplores attacks and harassment directed against UNISOM II and other international personnel serving in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Council considers that a durable political settlement remains an indispensable prerequisite for restoring peace and security, re-establishing central governmental structures and services and commencing the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction of the economic and social fabric in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council is gravely concerned by the lack of progress in reconciliation among Somali factions. It is particularly concerned by the fact that the national reconciliation conference, to which the 15 signatories of the Addis Ababa Agreement had agreed in Nairobi on 24 March 1994 and which was scheduled for 15 May 1994, has not taken place. The Council commends the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to reinvigorate the process of national reconciliation, including through the encouragement of local and regional initiatives and conferences. In this regard, it attaches great importance to an accelerated inter-clan reconciliation, in particular, among the Hawiye sub-clans, with the involvement of all concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Council stresses that the nature and the duration of the international support and resources the international community is committing to Somalia, including the continuing presence of UNISOM II, depend very much on the resolve of the Somali parties to achieve political compromise.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Council reminds the Somali parties that the future of their country lies in their hands and urges them once again to make every effort to advance the process of political reconciliation in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">&quot;The Council believes that the Secretary-General's proposed initial reduction of the UNISOM II troops is appropriate in the circumstances prevailing in Somalia. It stresses that priority attention should be given to ensuring the safety and security of UNISOM II and other international personnel, including the staff of non-governmental organizations. In this context, it underlines the responsibility of the Somali parties for the security and safety of these personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">&quot;The Security Council invites the Secretary-General to submit to the Council well before</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">30 September 1994, a substantive report on prospects for national reconciliation in Somalia and on the possible options for the future of UNISOM II.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the Symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-46.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/46</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
