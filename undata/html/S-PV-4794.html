	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2003-653.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2003/653</a>, which contains the report of the Security Council mission to Central Africa, and <a href="../pdf/S-2003-688.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2003/688</a>, which contains the report of the Security Council mission to West Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes with satisfaction the recommendations made in the reports of its mission to Central Africa from 7 to 16 June 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-653.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/653</a>) and its mission to West Africa from 26 June to 5 July 2003 (<a href="../pdf/S-2003-688.pdf" class="pdf">S/2003/688</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council endorses the recommendations of these two missions that fall within its area of responsibility and wishes to see them implemented. It has already taken the relevant recommendations into account in preparing its resolution renewing and strengthening the mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"Where responsibility for implementation falls to others, the Council looks forward to working in partnership with them, including United Nations agencies and programmes; Governments in Central Africa and West Africa; regional and subregional organizations, notably the Economic Community of West African States; donor countries; non-governmental organizations; and civil society. The Council invites them to keep it informed about their efforts at implementation, so that the Council can support them and take any further action necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council emphasises the importance of a subregional approach to issues such as small arms and light weapons, mercenaries, child soldiers and humanitarian access. It stresses that follow-up activity by the United Nations will require close cooperation and coordination throughout the United Nations system. Action in these areas should also involve the appropriate organizations, especially in West Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council invites the Secretary-General to follow up those recommendations that lie within his responsibility, and would be grateful for a report on progress by 30 November 2003.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council recognizes that resources may be needed to implement its recommendations. Therefore it will continue to encourage donor countries in a position to do so to support such efforts, and to assist regional and subregional organizations in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council intends to review progress in implementing the recommendations in December 2003."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-12.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/12</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
