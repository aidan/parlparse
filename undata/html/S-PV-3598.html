	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Angola in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda.

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have received photocopies of a letter dated 28 November 1995 from the Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the text of the Joint Communiqué issued by the Government and UNITA on 13 November 1995, which will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-1995-991.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/991</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the joint communiqué issued by the Government of Angola and UNITA on 13 November 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-991.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/991</a>) in which they reaffirmed their commitment to the peace process. The Council is pleased to note that some of the steps necessary to carry out the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex) have been taken recently, including the resumption of the military talks in Luanda, and the movement of the first UNITA combatants to quartering areas on 20 November 1995, the first anniversary of the signing of the Lusaka Protocol. The Council underlines the need for the quartering process to be completed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council, however, notes that despite these positive steps there continue to be cease-fire violations, importation of weapons, restrictions on freedom of movement, and the presence of mercenaries. The Council stresses that much remains to be done urgently to implement fully the Lusaka Protocol, including strict observance of the cease-fire, the continuation of the quartering process, the quartering of the Rapid Reaction Police, the return of the Forças Armadas Angolanas (FAA) to defensive positions, and the resolution of questions regarding the modalities of military integration. The Council calls upon the Government of Angola and UNITA to continue to cooperate with UNAVEM III and to respect fully the status and security of international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council will follow developments in Angola closely and looks forward to receiving the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Angola by 8 December 1995."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-58.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1995/58</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
