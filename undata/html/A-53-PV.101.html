	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk11-pa01">The Group of 77 and China welcomes the conclusion of the deliberations on the utilization of the development dividend, in the amount of $13 million, which will allow the Secretariat to implement the seven approved projects.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk11-pa02">Recognizing the ad hoc nature of this exercise, the Group emphasizes that all projects, in future, should be formulated and submitted for approval in accordance with existing budgetary procedures. The Group is of the view that for full implementation of these projects, the General Assembly will have to agree on a multi-year mechanism for the Development Account.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk11-pa03">The Group made great efforts and showed a significant degree of flexibility so as to facilitate the work of the Fifth Committee on the issue of the modalities and sustainability of the Development Account. Unfortunately, the initiative of the Group on this issue was not met in the same spirit by some of our negotiating partners. This led the Fifth Committee to defer consideration of the issue to the main part of the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk11-pa04">The Group would like to reaffirm its position that the operation of the Development Account should be in accordance with the relevant regulations and rules of the Organization, since it is a part of the regular budget. Furthermore, it must be neither a budget reduction exercise nor a staff reduction exercise.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk11-pa05">The Group stresses the need to conclude consideration of the issue of modalities and sustainability of the Development Account before we begin our deliberations on the budget at the fifty-fourth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk11-pa06">Finally, the Group is ready to work constructively and actively in concluding work on this important agenda item in the fifty-fourth session and expects a similar willingness and flexibility from our partners in this regard.</div>

<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Gold" nation="Israel" language="">
	Mr. Gold (Israel)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa01">First, I would like to reiterate that the State of Israel supports the continued funding and strengthening of United Nations peacekeeping forces in general. Moreover, we point to certain examples, such as the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), as models of the good work that peacekeeping forces can accomplish when the parties concerned share the responsibility for making them successful.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa02">Therefore, it should be clearly understood that our stance regarding those who would wilfully exploit these peacekeepers as a shield for bloodshed and hatred in no way detracts from our positive stance with regard to the mission of peacekeeping operations themselves.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa03">The terrorist group Hezbollah has enjoyed a safe haven in Lebanon from which to launch incessant attacks on civilian towns and villages in northern Israel, all through the 1980s and 1990s. It has taken hostage the citizens of other United Nations Member States. It has also assaulted the diplomatic missions of other Member States. Moreover, Hezbollah's attacks are declaredly aimed against Israel's very existence and against the lives of its civilians, notwithstanding Hezbollah's misuse of the term "resistance" to describe its terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa04">Indeed, on 6 March 1999, in a statement to <i>Jamhuri-i-Islami</i>, which is published in Tehran, Mr. Hassan Nasrallah stated,</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa05">"Palestine is occupied territory, and the Israeli presence there is an occupation entity and illegal. There is no end to the struggle with such a regime".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa06">Israel is left with no choice but to respond in self-defence to these attacks against its territory. It is therefore particularly regrettable that Hezbollah not only engages in terrorism, but attempts to hide behind civilians and United Nations areas while doing so. This amounts to a cruel and cynical exploitation of the neutral and innocent in the service of terrorism. And as we have seen, all terrorist tactics lead only to disastrous consequences and excess human suffering.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa07">It was in an effort to avoid these consequences that Israel issued a warning, on 14 April 1996, after days of relentless rocket attacks by Hezbollah on our northern villages. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) informed the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) that it had detected Hezbollah trying to fire rockets from the vicinity of UNIFIL positions in an attempt to escape a defensive response. The IDF requested that UNIFIL prevent Hezbollah from doing so.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa08">On 15 April, Fijian UNIFIL officers spotted Hezbollah attempting to fire rockets from the Fijian battalion. They ordered the Hezbollah terrorists to desist. Instead, the Hezbollah gunmen opened fire. On 17 April, noontime, UNIFIL soldiers, this time Nepalese, again tried to prevent Hezbollah terrorists from using a UNIFIL base to launch rocket attacks. They ordered the Hezbollah to cease its operations there. The Hezbollah responded with a hand-grenade attack.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa09">Later, on 17 April, UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel confirmed that rockets had been launched from a site near the Fijian headquarters. Israel once again warned that it would have to defend itself and not allow Hezbollah a safe haven for attack. On 18 April 1996, Israel informed UNIFIL that the IDF would have to respond to a rocket attack launched from a base merely 350 metres from the Qana compound. Only after all this did Israel finally respond in self-defence.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa10">Israel has announced its continued willingness to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a> in its entirety. That resolution calls not only for a withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, but also for the restoration of international peace and security and for the return of effective Lebanese authority to the area. Israel has repeatedly invited Lebanon to negotiate the implementation of the resolution. Lebanon, however, continues to refuse to negotiate.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa11">Clearly, the responsibility for the consequences of exercising the right of self-defence against armed attack must rest entirely with the perpetrators of such attack and with those who support them. Israel bears no responsibility or blame for taking necessary measures in the legitimate exercise of this right. Israel can, however, negotiate a resolution to the conflict that will restore peace and security to our border and ultimately prevent these incidents. Unfortunately, the Government of Lebanon refuses to consider this option.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk12-pa12">The draft resolution moves decidedly further away from reconciliation and resolution, not least because it distracts the Member States from the true culprits. Even worse, it rewards terrorists and their insidious exploitation of the innocent and the neutral. We urge Member States to oppose this confrontational initiative and instead to show good faith in opening a new era of working together to peacefully resolve conflicts. In this light, Israel calls upon the Government of Lebanon to return to the negotiating table and implement <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1973).pdf">resolution 425 (1973)</a> so that we may restore peace to our common borders.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk05-pa01">While the United States strongly supports the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which is implementing a difficult and important mandate, we were unable to support the adoption of this funding resolution because of the use of it to pursue claims against a Member State, which procedurally is not correct.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk05-pa02">That is why we opposed the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-237.pdf">General Assembly resolution 52/237</a> last year and 51/233 the previous year, which decided that the costs stemming from the incident at Qana should be borne by Israel alone. Those resolutions were not consensus resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg008-bk05-pa03">Since shortly after the United Nations inception, the procedure which has been followed is that the Secretary-General presents and pursues the settlement of the Organization's claims against a State or States.

	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Every time the Fifth Committee considers a draft resolution on the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the representative of the Israeli occupying forces levels accusations at us that are false and have no legal basis.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa02">We have heard the representative of the occupying Israeli forces attack the honourable people who are resisting the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. He called them terrorists because of their refusal to be subjected to the control of the Israeli occupation forces. But they are fighting for freedom and for the liberation of Lebanon from this shameful scourge. Is it possible that he does not believe that they are attacking Lebanon with criminal resolve, violating its sovereignty and integrity, and brazenly disregarding United Nations resolutions?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa03">What will succeeding generations think when they learn of the contravention by a State Member of this international Organization of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, Security Council and human rights organizations? That State clearly considers itself above international law and legitimacy. How can those who are resisting Israel's occupation of their land be terrorists? Is the occupation of a territory by force not terrorism? Is the assassination of innocent civilians, women and children, not terrorism? Was the bombing of United Nations headquarters in Qana by the Israeli occupying forces, as well as the murder of 106 innocent civilians, not an act of terrorism?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa04">The statement made by the representative of the occupying forces about the Qana incident is inaccurate. I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the report submitted by General Van Kappen, who was sent by the Secretary-General to investigate the Qana incident. That report (S/1996/337), issued on 7 May 1996, condemns the occupying forces and accuses them of bombing the United Nations headquarters even though they knew full well that innocent civilians had taken refuge behind the flag of the Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa05">What the Israeli occupying forces call terrorism is in fact valiant resistance against alien occupation -- a right that is safeguarded in all international instruments and laws. That valiant resistance against the forces of occupation will continue, along with political endeavours, until the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a>, which calls for the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Lebanese territories to internationally recognized boundaries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa06">I should like here to refer to the first defeat of the occupying forces: their pullout from Jenin. Israel's claim that it is working towards the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a> is but a lie aimed at misleading international public opinion and diverting attention from the crimes they commit daily. If Israel is so desirous of implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a>, the solution is clear-cut: unconditional and immediate withdrawal to international boundaries, as provided for in that resolution and not as interpreted by the Israeli occupying forces.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa07">Israel's conditions for withdrawal are nothing more than an attempt to shirk responsibility, to perpetuate the occupation and to divert attention from its expansionist policies. The Israeli occupying forces are destroying life in southern Lebanon with their repeated attacks on villages populated by innocent civilians. They are impeding the work of schools and the tasks of daily life. The right to life and to security are fundamental human rights, but the occupying forces are seeking to annihilate those rights in southern Lebanon. But they have not succeeded, and they will not succeed.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa08">The Israeli occupying forces have tried all manner of war against my country through violence and through invasion, but they have not succeeded. Lebanon believes in a peace based on resolutions of international legitimacy, the principle of land for peace and, in particular, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Let me cite the Torah, where in Habakkuk 2:17, the prophet warns that "The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you". That is the achievement of resistance.</div>

</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation wishes to respond to what was said by the representative of the Israeli terrorist forces of occupation. Everyone knows that Israel's history is built on war, occupation, aggression, colonization, settling on the land of others -- and on State terrorism, which since its foundation Israel has used against Arab civilians and even against the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The resolution we have just adopted addresses the consequences of Israeli terrorism against UNIFIL headquarters, a symbol of peace, at a time when Israel is trying to speak of peace. What can the international community expect of a State that commits aggression against a United Nations facility established to defend peace, undeterred by its United Nations insignia? The pretext cited by the representative of the terrorist occupying Power has already been rejected by the General Assembly, which has condemned the 1996 terrorism against UNIFIL headquarters at Qana in southern Lebanon. Israeli terrorism is State terrorism, not limited to killing people, taking their lands and creating refugees, but going so far as to attack the headquarters of a United Nations force, UNIFIL.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa03">Today's resolution is a minimal response to the major crime committed by Israel at Qana. In resolutions 51/233 and 52/237, the General Assembly called on Israel to bear the costs of its actions at Qana. But Israel has had no wish to comply, so those resolutions have been added to the list of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions that Israel has consistently flouted. If Israel is serious about seeking peace, then it must unconditionally implement Security Council resolutions <a href="../pdf/S-RES-242(1967).pdf">242 (1967)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-338(1973).pdf">338 (1973)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">425 (1978)</a>. It must also implement the relevant General Assembly resolutions calling upon it to withdraw from all occupied Arab territories.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa04">The heroic resistance of the valiant Lebanese fighters in southern Lebanon does that people credit, for their land is occupied by Israel.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa05">If Israel seriously wishes peace, it should begin by implementing the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. We have grown used to hearing the unconvincing arguments in favour of peace that the representative of Israel utters, but peace is not merely spoken about: peace has to be made. Israel's history is based on terrorism. How can the international community, as represented in this Assembly, believe that Israel will implement the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Israel's crime at Qana was not its first, and I fear it will not be its last. Resolutions of international legitimacy must be respected. This is the acid test of Israel's intentions: the implementation of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions is the only road to peace.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Orwellian language that has really not been used since the breakup of the Soviet empire is in high gear again in the United Nations. For us to create a new world order based on peace and security, certain basic definitions have to be agreed upon by Member States. That language does not seem to be agreed upon today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa02">The representative of Syria spoke about State terrorism. Indeed, it is the Syrian Arab Republic that is on the United States Department of State list of countries that are engaged in State support for terrorism. Terrorism is a form of warfare whose purpose is to take aim at innocent civilians. And that is precisely the type of warfare in which Hezbollah engages; it aims at Israeli towns and villages, strikes them not by accident but by intention.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa03">I frankly do not understand how the representative of Lebanon can speak about Hezbollah as honourable people, or as a valiant resistance, when indeed they take aim at Israeli towns and villages by intention.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The problem we face is that the voices we are hearing today coming out of Lebanon are resisting the peace process and are in fact scorning United Nations resolutions. On 5 January 1999, Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah stated plainly, "Only resistance will ensure the return of our land, not resolution 425, nor the Security Council, nor the international community".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa05">And rather than being rebuked, the leaders of Hezbollah were in fact praised -- for example, on the Voice of Lebanon on 16 February 1999, when Prime Minister Selim Hoss praised the jihad and resistance of Hezbollah. In fact, the policy of scorning <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a> was continued by the Lebanese Prime Minister when he stated on <i>Saut Al-Arab</i> radio on 14 March 1999, "We are not ready at all to discuss with Israel any security arrangements or the granting of any guarantees".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa06">To create peace and security we need common definitions. We need to rebuke terrorism -- terrorism that is not resistance, that targets civilians, seizes hostages and attacks diplomatic missions. That is not resistance. In order to make peace and security work in the Middle East we need to implement United Nations resolutions like <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">resolution 425 (1978)</a> of the Security Council, which seeks not only an Israeli withdrawal, but also the creation of peace and security along Israel's common border with Lebanon and the restoration of Lebanese authority in the south.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa07">Terrorism and peace are incompatible. Dialogue and the implementation of resolutions will create peace.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa01">I apologize for prolonging this discussion, but what we have heard compels us to respond.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa02">First, we do not accept the representative of the occupying forces giving us lessons on how to carry out a political dialogue. We know more than they do on that score. Secondly, the representative of the occupying forces defined terrorism as a war deliberately launched against civilians, which is exactly what Israel engages in. The representative of the occupying forces is credible to no one here representing the international community as a whole.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa03">The facts are quite straightforward: Israel, the occupying State, has occupied southern Lebanon since 1978. Resolution <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf">425 (1978)</a> calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of occupying forces from However, the occupying forces have for 21 years refused to implement that resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa04">What law endorses a State's occupation of the territory of another State and its imposition of conditions for withdrawal? And if the State that has suffered the aggression resists it is accused of terrorism. Is it not terrorism for Israel to acquire nuclear weapons and then threaten all its neighbours? Is aggression not committed daily against southern Lebanon?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa05">Qana is the place where the New Testament states that Jesus Christ performed his first miracle by changing water into wine. Yet even the holiness of that place meant nothing to the occupying forces when they violated the integrity of the headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) by deliberately bombing it. Any of the Members of the United Nations who followed developments at the time know that there was an Israeli reconnaissance plane flying over the area while the bombing was taking place. The plane was caught on videotape, and that tape was shown on television in a European State, a fact that was reported in newspapers throughout the world. It was on the basis of that information that Major-General van Kappen wrote his report contained in document S/1996/337. So what is the representative of the occupation talking about? Why does he wish to mislead people? His State is occupying the territory of another State by force. It must withdraw from Lebanon today, not tomorrow.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Resistance in Lebanon is supported by all the Lebanese people, not just by a particular segment of the population. Comprising 17 religious communities, all the people of Lebanon support the resistance and respect the martyrs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa07">We call for the occupying forces to respect international legitimacy like everyone else and to withdraw from southern Lebanon.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk01-pa08">Finally, I would like to point out that the representative of the occupying forces said he supported UNIFIL. I do not believe that is true. Recently, on 1 June I believe, UNIFIL forces were bombed by the occupying forces, and one soldier of the Irish battalion was martyred. The Secretary-General issued a statement in this connection in which he referred to the responsibility of Israel's so-called Defence Forces for this incident.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa02">Israel's crimes are as clear as day, regardless of how much it tries to cover them up. The General Assembly will therefore continue to consider those crimes year after year until Israel stops perpetrating them, withdraws from occupied Arab territories and ceases to carry out State terrorism.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Before speaking about a new world order, Israel should remember what that order is. It is an order based on peace -- a peace that Israel does not know and which it has never sought. That world order cannot be established without Israel's commitment to implement resolutions of international legitimacy. That is the only way to ensure that the new world order can provide the stability to which the representative of the occupying forces refers.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa04">With regard to his list of so-called terrorism, the representative of the terrorist occupying forces may recall that he is now at the United Nations, which represents 185 Member States. He is not at a forum of another Member State. Perhaps he is forgetting procedures and realities. It is only in his imagination that such a list exists.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg011-bk02-pa05">History has shown that since the establishment of Israel the words Israel and peace are contradictory -- an oxymoron, as they say in English. Those two words simply cannot go together. That is why Israel is a rogue State. It will remain on the periphery of international law until it implements the resolutions of international legitimacy; until it withdraws from occupied Arab territories; until it ends its daily acts of terrorism and until it respects the resolutions of the Security Council and the United Nations. Only then will peace be able to return to the region of the Middle East.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk13-pa01">The United States is pleased that the General Assembly has adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-12.pdf">resolution 53/12</a> B, which provides funding and staffing for the support account for peacekeeping operations. Peacekeeping is one of the United Nations most critical mandates and the backstopping effort at Headquarters provides much-needed support for those men and women who serve the Organization overseas. Let there be no doubt that the United States remains completely supportive of the peacekeeping function.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk13-pa02">The United States wants to emphasize the importance with which we view paragraph 21 of the resolution, which requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the necessary military and civilian police expertise in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is maintained. We consider the important roles and functions that the active duty military and police officers perform to be absolutely critical to the ability of the United Nations to mount and sustain its peacekeeping operations. We will watch closely to see that this expertise is maintained.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk13-pa03">While the United States joined consensus on this very important resolution, we are very skeptical of paragraph 26, in which the General Assembly decides to delete a paragraph from the Secretary-General's report on the support account. We will not enter into a debate on the content of the paragraph. We find, however, the notion that this might serve as a precedent very chilling. The General Assembly cannot rewrite reports of the Secretary-General. The General Assembly can only take action on reports of the Secretary-General when those reports contain his unbiased and honest views. This is not a budget document; the portion of the report in question had to do with the Secretary-General's view on the nature of threats to peace. It is not for the General Assembly to tell the Secretary-General how to think. If Member States disagree with elements of any report, the appropriate avenue is to make a formal statement to that effect, but censorship is not an appropriate recourse.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg016-bk13-pa04">This action cannot establish a precedent in the Organization. The United States will remain vigilant in making sure that the Secretary-General's ability to produce reports that carry his views is unimpeded.</div>

	Mr. Hynes (Canada)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the CANZ Group of countries -- Australia, New Zealand and Canada -- regarding the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-12.pdf">resolution 53/12</a> B concerning the support account for peacekeeping operations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Our delegations joined the consensus on that resolution because we believe that, during this period of transition, the level of posts and funding specified in the resolution are appropriate to meet the needs of the Organization in backstopping its important peacekeeping activities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa03">Our delegations are concerned, however, that, increasingly, extraneous references and requests for information are appearing in Fifth Committee resolutions. This resolution is a case in point, including as it does paragraphs that pertain to non-financial matters and clearly go beyond the Committee's mandate as the main General Assembly body charged with financial and budgetary matters. For example, paragraph 26 of this resolution -- as the representative of the United States of America has just mentioned -- decides, or I might say purports, to delete a paragraph of the report of the Secretary-General on the support account.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa04">Whatever the substantive merits of the issue at hand, we believe that a request to delete a paragraph of a report of the Secretary-General is an inappropriate and unjustified measure. It is not the responsibility of the Fifth Committee or of any other Committee to edit or rewrite the reports of the Secretary-General. Such action represents, in our view, a thoroughly inappropriate encroachment on the professional independence of the Secretary-General -- the independence he must enjoy to perform effectively his role as chief administrative officer of the Organization, a role laid down in Article 97 of the Charter and elaborated in Article 100.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa05">I might add that we are, of course, confident that, in reacting to this element of the resolution or in not reacting to it, the Secretary-General will ensure that this jurisdictional imperative is upheld.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa06">We would also like to note the concern of our delegations that the inclusion of this particular element in the resolution gave rise to unnecessary and protracted negotiations -- negotiations which focused primarily on non-financial matters and in which consensus on the funding and level of posts was quite inappropriately withheld as a bargaining chip until agreement could be reached. Our delegations consider this a most regrettable and irresponsible path for the Fifth Committee to take. It is, of course, a regular habit of the Fifth Committee to remind other Committees of the assertion in <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-45-248.pdf">General Assembly resolution 45/248</a> B that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg017-bk01-pa07">Given this predisposition, it would seem incumbent on the Fifth Committee in its turn to refrain from addressing items that fall more properly within the purview of other Main Committees.</div>

Subsequently, at its 91st plenary meeting on 15 December 1998, the General Assembly decided not to conclude its consideration of sub-item (f) of agenda item 93 so that any necessary decisions on the special session on population and development may be taken by the General Assembly at an appropriate time.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg018-bk13-pa03">In his letters, the Permanent Representative of Bangladesh informs the General Assembly that the Commission on Population and Development, acting as the preparatory committee for the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly, in view of the complexity of the subject and the diversity of the views on some contentious issues, was not able to finalize its work on the main substantive document for the special session. The Commission has therefore decided to recommend that the General Assembly, at its fifty-third session, authorize the Commission on Population and Development, acting as the preparatory committee, to hold a resumed session for four days in May or June 1999 in order to complete its work.</div>
