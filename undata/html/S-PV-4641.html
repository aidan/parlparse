	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now resume its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the continuing and full implementation of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a>, and welcomes the increasing focus over the last two years on the situation of women and girls in armed conflict, and recalls the statement by its President of 31 October 2001 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-31.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/31</a>) and the meetings held on 25 July 2002 and 28 October 2002 as expressions of that commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security (<a href="../pdf/S-2002-1154.pdf" class="pdf">S/2002/1154</a>) and expresses its intention to study the recommendations contained therein. The Council also welcomes the efforts of the United Nations system, Member States, civil society and other relevant actors to promote equal participation of women in peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council remains concerned about the slow progress in the appointment of women as special representatives and envoys of the Secretary-General, and urges the Secretary-General to increase the number of women serving as high-level representatives to achieve the overall goal of gender balance. The Council also urges Member States to continue to provide candidates to the Secretary-General for inclusion in a database.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council, reaffirming the importance of gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations and post-conflict reconstruction, undertakes to integrate gender perspectives into the mandates of all peacekeeping missions, and reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that all reports submitted to the Security Council in accordance with such mandates systematically address gender perspectives. The Council also requests the Secretary-General to provide systematic training of all staff in peacekeeping operations on gender perspectives, and to integrate gender perspectives into all standard operating procedures, manuals and other guidance materials for peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council considers that the appointment of gender advisers at sufficiently senior levels at Headquarters is necessary. The Council notes that some progress has been made in gender mainstreaming at mission level, specifically through the establishment of gender units and gender advisers, but that more remains to be done in order to ensure that gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations and post-conflict reconstruction is thorough and effective, and applied systematically.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council undertakes to integrate gender perspectives into the terms of reference of its visits and missions to countries and regions in conflict. To that end, the Council requests the Secretary-General to establish a database of gender specialists as well as women's groups and networks in countries and regions in conflict, and to include gender specialists in the teams where relevant.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council recognizes the vital role of women in promoting peace, particularly in preserving social order and educating for peace. The Council encourages Member States and the Secretary-General to establish regular contacts with local women's groups and networks in order to utilize their knowledge of both the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, including as victims and ex-combatants, and of peacekeeping operations, to ensure that those groups are actively involved in reconstruction processes, particularly at decision-making levels.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council, recalling its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1265(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1265 (1999)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1296(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1296 (2000)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">1325 (2000)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1379(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1379 (2001)</a>, encourages Member States, the entities of the United Nations system, civil society and other relevant actors, to develop clear strategies and action plans with goals and timetables, on the integration of gender perspectives in humanitarian operations, rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes, including monitoring mechanisms, and also to develop targeted activities, focused on the specific constraints facing women and girls in post-conflict situations, such as their lack of land and property rights and access to and control over economic resources.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council deplores the continuing occurrence of sexual exploitation, including trafficking, of women and girls in the context of peacekeeping operations and humanitarian activities, and calls for the further development and full implementation of codes of conduct and of disciplinary procedures to prevent such exploitation. The Council encourages all actors, in particular troop-contributing countries, to enhance monitoring mechanisms, and to investigate and prosecute effectively cases of alleged misconduct.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council condemns all violations of the human rights of women and girls in situations of armed conflict, and the use of sexual violence, including as a strategic and tactical weapon of war, which, inter alia, places women and girls at increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council decides to remain actively seized of this matter and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a follow-up report on the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> to be presented to the Security Council in October 2004."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2002-32.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2002/32</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">Statement by the President</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">As it comes to the end of its presidency of the Security Council, Cameroon would like to express its gratitude to the members of the Council and its sincere thanks for their excellent support. Individually and together, they have confirmed my country's conviction that the United Nations and, particularly, the Security Council are for the world, particularly for Africa, an irreplaceable diplomatic forum for cooperation and a strong bastion. The Council epitomizes the manner in which the world is evolving.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">I would say that often, at decisive moments in the history of humanity, the Council alone holds the key to a solution. Without its wisdom and experience and its resolve to promote peace and security, might would make right in many parts of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">The mission of the United Nations and of the Security Council in particular is to ensure that all States Members of the United Nations, working together, actively contribute more and more each day to the promotion of peace.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">It is clear that the future of the world will be shaped by the United Nations and the Security Council in particular. Cameroon is aware of how much Africa, especially Central Africa, owes the Council. That subregion, despite the end of the cold war and in part because of the historical crossroads we are at, is experiencing a great deal of upheaval, which has made it a primary hotbed of political crises and armed conflict on the continent.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Even before joining the Security Council, Cameroon was aware of the priority accorded, in the deliberations and the work of the Council, to its quest for appropriate and peaceful solutions to the dangers threatening us. The contributions it made during the 22 October debate on Central Africa, which Cameroon initiated with the Council's full support, and the commitments undertaken demonstrate -- if indeed we needed further demonstration of it -- the Council's continuing interest in our subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">Once again, I wish to thank my colleagues; the Secretary-General; the staff of the Secretariat, in particular the Security Council Affairs Division; and the interpreters and the translators.</p>
