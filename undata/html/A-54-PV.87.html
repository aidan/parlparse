I refer to paragraph 16 of that report, which contains a draft resolution on globalization. In paragraph 10 of that draft resolution, the phrase "needs of the people with efficient" should read as "needs of the people based on efficient".

I just want to place this on the record because this is the third time that my delegation has intervened on this matter. I hope that with this intervention the matter can be concluded satisfactorily.</p>

During delicate negotiations we agreed that in paragraph 13 of that draft resolution, the words "small island developing" should be capitalized, so the phrase reads "Small Island Developing States", and that this phrase should be followed by the acronym SIDS, in parentheses. Also, the phrase "Small Island Developing States" is correctly reflected in paragraph 14 of that resolution, but the acronym (SIDS) is missing.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg004-bk02-pa04">Furthermore, a correction should be made to the eleventh preambular paragraph and operative paragraph 8 of the draft resolution contained in paragraph 16 of document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-592.pdf">A/54/592</a> so that the words "small island developing" are also capitalized and the phrase "Small Island Developing States" followed by the acronym (SIDS), as was agreed.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg005-bk06-pa01">As an active participant in the ongoing dialogue on financing for development, the United States is pleased to join the consensus in adopting this draft resolution, which helps to carry the dialogue further to what we hope will be a productive and useful outcome for all concerned.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg005-bk06-pa02">It is noteworthy that Member States have recognized in this draft resolution that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are key stakeholders in development finance issues. In fact, these institutions and the regional development banks play a pre-eminent role in financing sustainable development. We would therefore encourage their maximum participation in the preparatory process and the final event itself.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg005-bk06-pa03">We remain concerned about the form and agenda of the final event, however. We believe that the importance of development finance issues merits high-level participation but emphasize that developing countries will be best served if the outcome of the event is not a political document but rather practical guidelines on the effective mobilization, prioritization and utilization of resources in support of national efforts to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. We would therefore strongly advocate a final event form that favours substance over style. Further, the form of the final event should be such that it does not soak up developing country or donor funds that could be put to more directly beneficial uses.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg005-bk06-pa04">We are pleased that the Preparatory Committee will have the opportunity to clarify the agenda. We consider the full implementation of the 1990s conferences and summits and the agenda for development to be an important goal. However, the inclusion of this topic in the agenda should not be interpreted as conveying any new or expanded funding obligations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg005-bk06-pa05">With regard to the agenda, we also wish to emphasize our view that questions such as governance of the IMF, the World Bank or the regional development banks and issues related to the international financial architecture can be addressed only by the relevant international forums such as the Financial Stability Forum or the Group of 20. We believe that the agenda for the United Nations should focus on the ways in which the United Nations can encourage Member States' own development efforts.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg005-bk06-pa06">We continue to support the constructive dialogue between the United Nations and the relevant international institutions in an effort to achieve development goals.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Kittikhoun</span><span class="nation">Lao People's Democratic Republic</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg007-bk07-pa01">As we all know, every two years the General Assembly considers and adopts a draft resolution on specific actions related to the particular needs and problems of the landlocked developing countries. This issue has long been recognized by the General Assembly and the international community. Numbering 30, landlocked developing countries are among the poorest countries and continue to face many different problems and difficulties. The lack of territorial access to the sea, aggravated by the remoteness from world markets and the resulting prohibitive transit transport costs, impose considerable constraints on the external trade and economic development of this group of countries.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg007-bk07-pa02">In my capacity of chairman of the group, I would like today to express our sincere appreciation to all Member States, especially our transit neighbours, as well as our development partners, for the spirit of cooperation and flexibility which made possible the adoption by consensus of the resolution just adopted. We very much hope that that adoption by consensus will pave to way to the full implementation of the conclusions and recommendations of the fourth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and Development Institutions, held last August.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg007-bk07-pa03">The fourth Meeting of Governmental Experts was a success. The General Assembly has just welcomed its conclusions and recommendations. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my appreciation to the Government of Japan for its financial support, which enabled the participation of landlocked developing countries in that meeting. I also wish to thank and congratulate Ambassador Satoh of Japan for his able chairmanship. The meeting was especially important, as it considered that it was necessary to convene a ministerial meeting in 2003 as a further effort to address the problems of landlocked and transit developing countries. We, the landlocked developing countries, are truly looking forward to that big event, and the Office of the Special Coordinator for Least Developed, Landlocked and Island Developing Countries should be strengthened in order to enable it to carry out, effectively and efficiently, its mandate in support of the landlocked developing countries. I would like to urge all Member States to support the proposal before the Fifth Committee in this regard.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg007-bk07-pa04">We are also pleased that the General Assembly has agreed that the fifth Meeting of Governmental Experts in 2001 would consider convening a ministerial meeting in 2003. This is a very encouraging indication that the international community is seriously seized with the issue facing the landlocked developing countries. We urge the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in particular to effectively prepare for the fifth Meeting, in collaboration with other organizations, including the Regional Commission, bearing in mind the proposed ministerial meeting in 2003.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg007-bk07-pa05">By way of conclusion, the group of landlocked developing countries once again wishes to express its gratitude to the donor community for its support and to UNCTAD for its overall assistance and cooperation aimed at resolving the particular problems and needs faced by the landlocked developing countries. It is our hope that we will continue to receive more support and financial assistance, and on the most concessional terms possible. The development of an efficient and self-reliant transport system, indeed, requires due and priority consideration on the part of the international community.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg008-bk01-pa01">The Russian delegation wishes to speak in explanation of vote on <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-54-200.pdf">resolution 54/200</a> on unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg008-bk01-pa02">Recently, we have witnessed with increasing frequency the use by a number of countries of economic means to exert political pressure. We feel that the resolution that has just been adopted should help the international community to combine its efforts and take urgent and effective steps to stop such actions against all States.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg008-bk01-pa03">In this connection, the Russian delegation is seriously concerned by the steps taken by the United States and the members of the European Union to impose unilateral sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The use of such economic measures, which are not sanctioned by the Security Council, and the imposition of compliance with them on third States -- which is incompatible with the United Nations Charter and generally recognized principles of international law -- contradict the basic principles of the system of multilateral trade and undermine the processes of settlement. They also seriously destabilize the situation in the Balkan region.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg008-bk01-pa04">In the light of the events surrounding Yugoslavia, we feel that the resolution has assumed new importance. The conclusions of experts contained in the report of the Secretary-General prepared in compliance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-181.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 52/181</a>, reflect the need to oppose the use of unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion, especially the practice of secondary boycotts against third-party States. The report rightly notes that</p>
	<blockquote id="docA54PV87-pg008-bk01-pa05">"unilateral measures of coercion are increasingly at odds with the evolving principles and rules of international economic and social cooperation that are embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and the constituent treaties of multilateral trade and financial institutions, such as the World Trade Organization, and that seek to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, mechanisms and procedures for collective policy review and dispute settlement". (<i><a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-486.pdf">A/54/486</a>, para. 50</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg008-bk01-pa06">The Russian delegation, having voted in support of <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-54-200.pdf">resolution 54/200</a>, stresses its position of principle on the unacceptability of the unilateral use of economic measures aimed at a specific country that harm the economic interests of others.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg013-bk10-pa01">The delegation of Ecuador had the honour of coordinating, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the negotiations on draft resolution A/C.2/54/L.43 on "International cooperation to reduce the impact of the El Niño phenomenon".</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg013-bk10-pa02">With the adoption of this resolution, the General Assembly has taken one further step towards designing and applying an international multidisciplinary and intersectoral strategy to prevent the catastrophic effects of this cyclical phenomenon. Since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-52-200.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 52/200</a>, the United Nations system and the international community have adopted practical and constructive measures in order better to understand the El Niño phenomenon. The setting up of a task force, the convening in Guayaquil of the first Intergovernmental Meeting of Experts, with the participation of 450 scientists from various regions of the world, and the publication of a technical and scientific document on the impact that this phenomenon had in 1997 and 1998, are clear examples of the positive action taken in the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg013-bk10-pa03">My delegation would like to express particular gratitude to the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization for publishing that important work, which reflects the valuable contributions made by the international scientific community with regard to the El Niño phenomenon. We also extend our thanks to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Council of Scientific Unions, for their important cooperation in making it possible.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg013-bk10-pa04">The General Assembly has adopted <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-54-220.pdf">resolution 54/220</a>, thereby expressing its support for the establishment in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, of an international research centre to investigate the El Niño phenomenon. The centre will make it possible to observe and monitor this phenomenon more closely. Information will be shared with the main regional and international oceanic and atmospheric observation centres. Cooperation with the United Nations system and the international community will make this important project a reality.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg013-bk10-pa05">I should now like to refer to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-54-219.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 54/219</a>, "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction: successor arrangements", with regard to which the delegation of Ecuador was honoured to serve as coordinator, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. At the end of the Decade, the United Nations will have as a guide the international strategy for natural disaster reduction, which will continue to be the basic platform in this field. Preventive efforts will be essential in this regard. In January 2000, a task force and an inter-agency secretariat will be set up. My delegation hopes that this process will draw on experience gained, and will benefit from the knowledge of the staff of the Decade's secretariat.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg013-bk10-pa06">In conclusion, my delegation wishes to express, through you, Mr. President, our thanks to all representatives for their valuable contribution, as well as for their very constructive spirit during the entire negotiating process, which enabled us to arrive at a consensus on both resolutions. Their complete implementation, including in the administrative field, will be essential for ensuring respect for the will of the General Assembly on these important issues -- the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction and international cooperation to reduce the impact of the El Niño phenomenon.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Gallagher</span><span class="nation">United States</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg017-bk01-pa01">The United States joined the consensus on this resolution because we believe that, on balance, it represents a step forward in a number of areas.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg017-bk01-pa02">On the issue of good governance, after lengthy debate the Second Committee was able to come to a consensus. We look forward to continuing and broadening this dialogue. Part of the way forward is to strengthen the support of the international community to developing countries so that they can develop the capacities, skills and institutions necessary to confront globalization.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg017-bk01-pa03">But just as important is a fundamental understanding of the need for Governments to effectively manage their own development. The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly has helped move the debate forward by recognizing that good governance is governance that is responsible to the needs of the people, based on efficient, participatory, transparent and accountable public service, policy-making processes and administration. This is an excellent working definition that can be strengthened by further developing concepts such as democracy and civil society. Strong democratic institutions and civil society organizations are critical in assuring that Governments are responsive to the needs of the people.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg017-bk01-pa04">Globalization is having profound implications for the promotion of good governance, as this issue is no longer confined to national borders. On the one hand, globalization is encouraging Governments, in partnership with the private sector and civil society, to adopt policies to promote economic efficiency and growth. On the other hand, we are continuing to learn from the Asian financial crisis and other recent developments that transparency and disclosure are critical for healthy economies in which benefits of growth are widely shared. We must continue to work together to find shared approaches, principles and guidelines.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg017-bk01-pa05">One thing is for sure: good governance is important for countries at all stages of development. Over the past several years, there has been widespread recognition that good governance is essential for sustainable development. In recent years, the significance of good governance has also become prominent among both the member countries of the international financial institutions and the management of those institutions. Bilaterally, donor partners have in place numerous programmes to help countries overcome governance problems. Nationally, many countries are talking openly about good governance as being critical for economic growth and development. With the support of the international community, many are in front in establishing effective mechanisms to improve governance.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg017-bk01-pa06">As good governance has become a central pillar of economic growth and poverty alleviation, the United Nations and its agencies should continue progress on this critical issue.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa01">It is a distinct honour for me, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, Mexico and sponsors, to introduce draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.74.pdf">A/54/L.74</a>, entitled "International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters from relief to development", for consideration and adoption by the Assembly under agenda item 20.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa02">In addition to the sponsors listed on the draft before the Assembly, I am pleased to announce that the following countries have joined as sponsors: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Benin, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Gabon, Guatemala, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Sudan, Tunisia, Uruguay and Venezuela.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa03">Humanitarian emergencies have caused immeasurable human suffering, not to mention severe economic and social dislocation. As the Secretary-General has observed in his report on the strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations, a particularly striking phenomenon has been the extraordinary rise in the number and scale of natural disasters and of their human and financial costs.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa04">Natural calamities claimed the lives of more than 50,000 people worldwide in 1998. In the same year, the economic losses resulting from these occurrences were estimated to exceed $90 billion, compared to $30 billion in 1997. This, of course, is only part of the story. Not only has there been a need to wrestle with the increased onslaught of natural disasters, but the world community has had to face a growing incidence of complex humanitarian emergencies which afflict millions of people across the globe, resulting in untold suffering and death. We continue to be saddened and alarmed by these developments and by the disproportionate burden borne in such circumstances by the most vulnerable, especially women and children.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa05">As we speak, the world is once again witness to the terrible fury of nature, which has brought death and destruction to thousands of people in Venezuela. The final toll of the disastrous flooding and mudslides that struck that country in recent days is yet to be fully reckoned. Already, however, it is recorded as the worst disaster to have hit the country this century.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa06">On behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the sponsors, allow me to join you, Mr. President, in extending sincere condolences to the Government and people of Venezuela on the occasion of this national tragedy and to pledge our determination, as the international community, to support their efforts at recovery.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa07">Against the realities to which I have referred, draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.74.pdf">A/54/L.74</a> represents, in our view, a timely and necessary, albeit modest, step towards a more concerted international action to address the humanitarian impact of natural disasters. The text before the Assembly is the result of open-ended informal consultations based on an initial draft put forward by the Group of 77 and China and Mexico.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa08">This, it may be recalled, is the first such initiative to be proposed by the Group in over eight years, the last being that undertaken during the forty-sixth session which led to the consensus adoption by the General Assembly of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-182.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/182</a>, which annexed landmark guiding principles of humanitarian assistance. These principles have inspired and guided the sponsors in the present exercise, but there has been a further motivation, and that is the sheer conviction that the time has come to once again focus international attention on the plight occasioned by natural disasters and on the necessity for enhanced international cooperation on humanitarian assistance in this field, proceeding from relief to development.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa09">Beyond these fundamentals, the draft contains a number of provisions aimed at promoting action at various levels, with a view to maximizing the effectiveness of the response to natural disasters at both the national and international levels through enhanced international cooperation.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa10">In this context, the improved coordination of United Nations humanitarian assistance is a key element in enhancing the international response to crises in the humanitarian domain. The agreed conclusions on the theme of international cooperation and coordinated responses to humanitarian emergencies, in particular in the transition from relief to rehabilitation, reconstruction and development, which were adopted by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in July 1999 provide an important building block for further action in this regard. We intend to work with all partners and with the Secretariat to fully implement these conclusions, as well as the draft before the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa11">In commending the draft resolution for adoption, I wish, on behalf of the sponsors, to express our appreciation for the work being done by the Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Sergio Vieiro de Mello, the staff of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the members of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee to respond on a daily basis to the plight of millions throughout the world who need humanitarian assistance. At the same time, we take this opportunity to salute the teams of United Nations personnel who, together with their counterparts in other humanitarian agencies and local personnel, continue to labour to bring relief and hope to those suffering as a result of such emergencies. Indeed, many of those individuals serve at great risk to their personal safety and security, and some have lost their lives. On behalf of the sponsors, I wish to pay special homage to those who, recently and at other times in the past, have paid the maximum price in service to their fellow members of the human family.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa12">In conclusion, let me also pay tribute to the Permanent Representative of Denmark, whose oversight and guidance on the issues pertaining to agenda item 20 were an invaluable contribution to the success of consultations on the present draft. I would also like to commend the excellent work done by Mr. Atul Khare of India in facilitating the consultations on the draft. Finally, a special word of appreciation goes to all our partners who participated actively and constructively in the consultations on draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.74.pdf">A/54/L.74</a>. Their contributions have greatly enriched the final product.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa13">Before concluding, allow me to draw the attention of the Assembly to two corrections that need to be made to the text before the Assembly. The first is in the first preambular paragraph. After the words, "United Nations system", a comma should be inserted and the word "and" deleted. Following "December 1997", a comma should be inserted. A reference to draft resolution A/C.2/54/L.44, entitled "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction: successor arrangements", should also be included.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa14">In the first line of the second preambular paragraph, where reference is made to the report of the Secretary-General, the title of that report should be in quotes, beginning with the word "strengthening" and ending with the words "United Nations".</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg018-bk16-pa15">With these corrections, it is the hope of the sponsors that draft resolution L.74 will be adopted by consensus, and in that expectation I commend it to the Assembly for consideration.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg020-bk01-pa02">In its preambular part, the draft resolution expresses the concern of the General Assembly at the human and material losses experienced by Venezuela as a result of the floods and massive landslides of recent days. On the basis of the magnitude of the problem that natural disasters represent for development, it recognizes that efforts at the national level need to be supplemented with international cooperation and assistance, particularly international emergency assistance. It takes note of the appeal of the Secretary-General to the international community for assistance to help with the effects of the disaster and of the appeal of the Government of Venezuela for emergency humanitarian assistance, as well as for the assistance necessary for the task of rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg020-bk01-pa03">In the operative part, draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.76.pdf">A/54/L.76</a> expresses the solidarity of the international community with the people and Government of Venezuela at this difficult time. It appeals to all Member States, international organizations, specialized agencies of the United Nations system, the international financial institutions and non-governmental organizations to assist Venezuela in its relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts, and expresses due gratitude to all States, organizations and groups that are have so generously assisted -- and are assisting -- Venezuela in the immediate relief work. Finally, the draft resolution expresses its gratitude to the Secretary-General for the urgent steps he has already taken to mobilize international assistance and requests him to make all necessary provisions to continue mobilizing and coordinating the assistance and cooperation that can be provided by the organizations and agencies of the United Nations in support of the national efforts of Venezuela.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg020-bk01-pa04">On behalf of Venezuela and the Member States sponsoring draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.76.pdf">A/54/L.76</a>, we would greatly appreciate the favourable consideration of the draft resolution by the General Assembly and its adoption as a manifestation of the solidarity and support of the international community in the face of the emergency being experienced by my country.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg020-bk01-pa05">Venezuela is in mourning as a result of an unprecedented tragedy. Relentless rains produced flooding throughout our national territory last week. In the central zone, an area with significant urban settlements and economic infrastructure, massive landslides and floods occurred, sowing death and destruction on a terrifying scale. The number of people who have been injured, who have disappeared and who have died make this natural disaster the worst every experienced in Venezuela. We are certain that, strengthened by the unity of its people and Government in the face of this disaster and by the generous support of the community of nations, Venezuela will be able to face, with a renewed sense of faith and hope, the difficult tasks of emergency humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and reconstruction forced on us by this natural disaster.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg020-bk01-pa06">I wish to offer our particular gratitude for the many messages of solidarity my country has received in recent days; to you, Sir, for your statement at the eighty-fifth plenary meeting in your capacity as President of the Assembly; to the Secretary-General for the message of support and condolence sent on behalf of him personally and of the Organization to the President of Venezuela; and to the coordinator of the Group of 77 for his recent statement, speaking on behalf of all members of the Group, China and Mexico.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg020-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, I also wish to place on record the gratitude of my entire country and people for the generous assistance being given Venezuela by many States represented here, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations. We offer them all our deepest thanks.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa01">I speak on behalf of the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). In reality, it is a privilege to do so, albeit in reference to a most sad and disastrous occasion.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa02">What has happened in Venezuela -- and, indeed, what is happening in the Americas -- causes us to reflect on the changes which this planet seems to be going through. Certainly, in the past 10 years, one has had to wonder if there has been any region affected and afflicted in the manner that Latin America and the Caribbean have been.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa03">From an environmental perspective, we have had the woes of earthquakes; we have had the perils of volcanoes -- the most recent, of course, being the plight of the Monserratans; we have the knowledge that there is an underground volcano off Grenada; and last year and this, we have had two late-season hurricanes coming in the month of November, which have caused us much concern as to the future. We know that the scientists are debating whether this is due to global warming, with their arguments pro and con. But what we are most concerned about is what is being done to try and alleviate the plight of the people who have suffered.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa04">Presently, we do not know how many people were killed in the floods and the mud slides in Venezuela. Estimates range up to 20,000 and perhaps even more. When we think of the deaths, we have to think of the corresponding families that might be affected through loss of wage-earners and the like.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa05">To the people of the Caribbean, the affliction in Venezuela is of particular concern, not only because Venezuela is in reality a Caribbean country, having a large Caribbean coastline. Many know of the island of Margarita, which is certainly in the Caribbean, but closer to us in the eastern Caribbean, right within our waters, is Aves Island, located very close to Dominica. We have had a history of involvement with Venezuela, going back to the days of slavery. Francisco de Miranda, <i>El Precursor </i>himself, got support and inspiration from his visits to Haiti and Jamaica in launching the revolutionary struggle; so, too, did Simon Bolívar. So there has been this initial connection, to the extent that a St. Lucian seaman died in the struggle for Venezuela's independence.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa06">We are therefore deeply connected to Venezuela and it is with a sense of pride and achievement that, when those of us from the CARICOM States visit the National Pantheon in Venezuela and walk in the path of heroes adorned by statues on either side, we see prominently displayed El Negro Primero. We consider this to be part of our contribution.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa07">The people of Venezuela are a sturdy people, a hard-working people -- a people devoted to family, to hamlet, to village, to country. In reality, it mirrors a lot of what is in the island Caribbean in that it is a very polyglot society, drawing on the continents of Africa, Asia and Europe. There, we find a mixture, both phenotypical and cultural, of the Maghreb, of Africa south of the Sahara, of Iberia and of genuine Americana.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa08">Now that we are closer together in the Association of Caribbean States and remember the many occasions on which Venezuela has come to the assistance of the English-speaking Caribbean States -- and knowing that it has done so not expecting anything in return, save only the knowledge that it has lent a helping hand -- it causes the people of our region to be affected physically, in an emotional manner. It causes us to be affected mentally, through profound concern. It causes us to be affected spiritually, with brotherly and sisterly affection.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk02-pa09">And so, on behalf of all the countries for which I speak, I appeal for draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.76.pdf">A/54/L.76</a> to be adopted unanimously and that we work towards alleviating the plight of the Venezuelan people.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk03-pa01">The item before us is of the greatest importance to mankind, and it is for that reason that my country would like to demonstrate its solidarity by expressing its full support for draft resolutions <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.74.pdf">A/54/L.74</a>, which is of a general nature, and <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.76.pdf">A/54/L.76</a>, which deals specifically with the situation in the sisterly Republic of Venezuela.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk03-pa02">As a member of the Latin American family, we cannot fail to point out that our region, and the subregion of the Caribbean and Central America in particular, has been one of the regions most battered by natural disasters in recent months. The physical damage and the loss of human life have been truly significant. The latter cannot be repaired. The former is where cooperation and international solidarity can help mitigate the consequences.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk03-pa03">It seems to be a constant that natural disasters vent their fury on the poorest regions and peoples, for which recovery is so much more costly. That is why our efforts should be aimed at both preventive action and at providing cooperation for recovery and, ultimately, development. The recent case in the sisterly Republic of Venezuela has once again brought sorrow to the heart of the whole region. The material loss is incalculable, but even more painful is the fact that the exact number of lives lost may never be known and all the victims may not be identified.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk03-pa04">As it has done in the case of previous disasters that have struck the region, the Government and the people of my country responded immediately to the appeal for solidarity. We are able to announce that the first flight of an air force Hercules C-130 filled with food, medicine and clothing will depart today from our capital bound for Caracas. That shipment includes mostly milk, corned beef, rice, blankets and so on. A second flight will depart in January and will also contain a water purification plant and engineers and technicians to install it and set it in operation.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg021-bk03-pa05">We are certain that the feelings that brought about this spontaneous act by the Government and the people of Uruguay are equally felt by other States, both within and outside the region, and that most of them will contribute to mitigating the consequences of this disaster.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Relang</span><span class="nation">Marshall Islands</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa01">At the outset, we wish to convey our deepest condolences to the Government and the people of Venezuela for the recent tragedy that has destroyed lives and property.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa02">I wish to make this brief statement on behalf of the 10 South Pacific Forum member States represented in New York, namely, Australia, the Republic of the Fiji Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, New Zealand, the Republic of Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and my own country, the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I wish to make this statement with regard to the draft resolution contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.74.pdf">A/54/L.74</a>, entitled "International cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters from relief to development", which is to be adopted by the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa03">We also wish to express our thanks to the Permanent Mission of India for its superb and excellent work in coordinating this draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa04">The member States of the South Pacific Forum fully support this draft resolution. As a subregion that is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters resulting from violent tropical cyclones, El Niño, tsunamis, tidal waves, droughts, brush fires and earthquakes, we are committed to supporting the remarkable role played by the United Nations and its response system, including its engagement with many intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, in the delivery of much-needed relief assistance to our peoples.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa05">We recently witnessed again innocent people being affected by severe earthquakes in the East New Britain Province of Papua New Guinea and by the earthquake that took place during the first week of this month in the Republic of Vanuatu, which caused death and injuries and left several thousand homeless.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa06">We have seen that even in times of dire financial strife, this Organization has demonstrated its comparative advantage in attracting international attention and mobilizing a concerted and timely response to the plight of hundreds of thousands worldwide who have had their lives and those of their families shattered simply because of meteorological and seismic forces beyond their control.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa07">The draft resolution universally affirms the fundamental importance of our collective effort to strengthen international cooperation in accordance with the principles of neutrality, humanity and impartiality. We agree that the assistance provided by the United Nations, from relief to development, should be determined on the basis of human needs arising from the adverse impact of a natural disaster. Where national and regional mechanisms exist, the United Nations should make optimal use of those channels, for the very reason that those on the ground are usually the first to respond and are more attuned to understanding the social and cultural sensitivities of the communities in and around the disaster area.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa08">The memories of earthquakes in Japan and Turkey, the recent floods in India and Viet Nam -- our Asian neighbours -- even worse floods and mud slides in Venezuela, and the grave destruction caused by hurricanes Jose and Lenny in the Caribbean and the territories of that region, are stern reminders that prevention and preparedness at the national level of developing countries can never be fully sufficient. Given the economic situation of developing countries in our region, we are pleased that the Assembly calls upon the United Nations Development Programme and other bodies of the United Nations system, such as the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization, to strengthen their operational activities and capacity-building in natural disaster mitigation, prevention and preparedness.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa09">We pledge our strong support for continued improvement of our regional and national efforts for enhanced partnerships with civil society and to establish national strategies to maximize disaster preparedness and response, including the rehabilitation and reconstruction of areas affected by natural disasters. In this regard, we agree that the Economic and Social Council should continue to develop ways to enhance further the effectiveness of international cooperation and coordination in the provision of timely and commensurate humanitarian assistance to effectively respond to natural disasters. We note in this regard the importance of maintaining support for natural disaster funding in the face of growing pressure on declining levels of official development assistance.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa10">We welcome the reference to the use of space-based technologies for the prevention, mitigation and management of natural disasters in vulnerable societies. In this respect, we from the Pacific wish to place on record our collective appreciation to those countries which have assisted us in this regard, especially Australia, Japan, the United States and New Zealand.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa11">We also especially welcome efforts to expand the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) roster to include more representatives from the countries of Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, Latin America and the Caribbean. We note that UNDAC team members would be financed solely by the Governments of the countries that the team members represent. We stress, however, that we in the Pacific would prefer the use of team members from the Pacific, because the preservation of our particular cultural values may not be easily understood by others.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa12">In this respect, we would emphasize the need for funding the deployment of team members from vulnerable societies such as ours to natural-disaster zones within the Pacific. We note that this is not provided for in this draft resolution, but we would nevertheless wish to emphasize this special need.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa13">The Pacific Island Forum countries strongly stress the need for increased attention to disaster preparedness, including funds from international cooperation in natural disasters. We feel that a critical component of an effective response system is to have simple, less bureaucratic procedures to release funds for this purpose. We emphasize that contributions made for humanitarian assistance in times of natural disaster should not be to the detriment of resources earmarked for international development assistance or complex humanitarian emergencies. We agree that the Central Emergency Revolving Fund and other appropriate contingency funds should be enhanced and more actively used for timely response in order to enhance stability among those affected, thereby reducing the risks to the wider population of the country and the region.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa14">Our countries look forward to working closely with all interested delegations on innovative mechanisms to increase funding and draw from existing organizations, both public and private, involved in humanitarian assistance and natural-disaster prevention.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg022-bk01-pa15">Finally, we believe that strengthened national efforts are central to timely and effective disaster response. No amount of institutional reform can provide a panacea to the problems relating to the coordination of humanitarian assistance, as each country, region and type of natural disaster has its own characteristics, which affect the impact on life, property and environment. In this regard, we appreciate the genuine efforts by those institutions at all levels to develop a cohesive and integrated approach to disaster prevention and relief, and we reaffirm our confidence in the current successor arrangements for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction and the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.</p>

	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa01">First of all, I should like to express to the people of Venezuela, who have been so sorely tried, the sympathy, condolences, support and active solidarity of the African Group.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa02">Since the adoption by the Assembly of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-92.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 53/92</a>, the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa (<a href="../pdf/A-52-871.pdf" class="pdf">A/52/871</a>) has been on the agenda of the main bodies of the United Nations. Such was the case in the Economic and Social Council during its substantive session in 1999. Such has also been the case in the Security Council, which, in September this year, discussed the progress report of the Secretary-General(S/1999/1008). On 8 and 9 December 1999, the Assembly discussed the issue in a debate in which 12 delegations took part, two of which spoke on behalf of the regional groups.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa03">The draft resolution under consideration today, <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.75.pdf">A/54/L.75</a>, which summarizes the decisions taken and concerns expressed in the various bodies, sets out directions and a future framework for the concerted and coordinated implementation of the recommendations to promote durable peace in Africa. We should recall that it aims to do so through the elimination of conflicts and poverty eradication. The preambular part of the draft resolution recalls, in addition to the conclusions of the United Nations bodies, the resolutions relating to the launching of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. It also stresses the need for coordinated follow-up by initiatives for the development of Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa04">The operative part of the draft resolution suggests that the General Assembly take a number of decisions. First, it would take note of the conclusions adopted by the Economic and Social Council, especially the decision to hold a high-level debate on Africa in 2001. It would also invite the development partners of Africa to work towards the implementation of the agreed conclusions of the Economic and Social Council. In order to make activities for the development of Africa fast and efficient, it is proposed that the General Assembly establish an open-ended working group, which would have a dual mandate. It would be responsible for monitoring the implementation both of the recommendations of the Secretary-General and of the agreed conclusions of the in Economic and Social Council, in particular determining actions to be taken as a matter of urgency with regard to poverty eradication, debt relief, the struggle against pandemics such as AIDS and the provision of support to countries in post-conflict situations.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa05">The working methods of the working group are also set out in the draft resolution. It will be chaired by the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session, assisted by two vice-chairpersons. An organizational meeting of the working group is provided for, to be held not later than in March 2000. Finally, the Secretary-General is requested to provide the working group with all necessary assistance, as he has promised to do. He is also requested to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa06">Great importance is attached not only to the report of the Secretary-General but also to that to be submitted by the working group, inasmuch as both of those documents will have to contain elements conducive to facilitating the decisions of the heads of State at the Millennium Summit, within the framework of the theme of peace, security and development.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa07">Those are the main points and ideas of draft resolution <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-54-L.75.pdf">A/54/L.75</a>, which I have the honour to introduce to the Assembly on behalf of the African States.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa08">In concluding, I should like to express our deep gratitude to the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, which participated in the consultations and enriched the initial draft. The African Group also benefited from the inestimable support and contributions of the Group of 77 and China.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa09">Finally, I should like to say that the African Group has been joined as sponsors by the countries members of the Group of 77 and China, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France and the United States. The draft resolution has also been sponsored by Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Greece, Guyana, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Suriname, Sweden and the United Kingdom. On behalf of Africa, I thank them for their support, which will be offered not only when the draft resolution is adopted by consensus, but also, and above all, when the agreed conclusions are implemented. In that way the States Members of the United Nations will contribute to ensuring that Africa remains what it should never cease to be: a favoured partner of the United Nations and its Member countries, in particular the developed countries.</p>
	<p id="docA54PV87-pg024-bk07-pa10">Africa is waiting. It is waiting for the international community to accompany it as it is reborn at the dawn of the twenty-first century and of the third millennium. Africa will remember.</p>
