	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist bombing that took place in Bali, Indonesia, on 1 October 2005, which has again fallen victim to a heinous act of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa04">"The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of these attacks and their families, and to the people and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa05">"The Security Council underlines the need to bring the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these intolerable acts to justice, and urges all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1373(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, to cooperate with and provide support and assistance, as appropriate, to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa08">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations."</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk12">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jenie</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa01">Let me express the full appreciation of the Government and the people of Indonesia for the recognition and prompt attention that has been paid by the Security Council to the tragic bombings in Bali last Saturday. We are mindful of this concern for the tragic and senseless attacks on ordinary people leading ordinary lives.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa02">Let me also take this opportunity to express the condolences of the Government of Indonesia to those families and nations that lost people in the brutal attacks of the weekend.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa03">In condemning the latest Bali attacks, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stressed that they were "clearly acts of terrorism because the victims were indiscriminately chosen and the targets were public areas". All of Indonesia is understandably horrified by this brutal tragedy, which is being speedily investigated. The perpetrators will be made to account for their actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa04">Let me make one point very clear. The Government of Indonesia will not be derailed in its efforts to create an open, democratic society. We will not be blackmailed or scared away from our efforts to enhance development. We will not succumb to terrorism or to any other kind of organized crime. We will continue to cooperate with other nations which are working hard to develop a comprehensive response to terrorism. We know that, in the end, terrorism will be defeated.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa05">As for Bali, we know that its status as a front-line tourist destination will not change or be destroyed by terrorists hoping to scare visitors away. Bali will recover, it will continue to grow, and it will continue to receive visitors from all over the world. We will work hard on this front.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa06">Finally, let me restate the belief of the Government of Indonesia that our approach to combating terrorism should include efforts to win the hearts and minds of the people. We must enhance efforts to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence by empowering the moderates of our society.</p>
