	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01"> The General Assembly will continue with the election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace those members whose term of office expires on 31 December 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">As members will recall, when the 32 nd plenary meeting was adjourned earlier today, there still remained one seat from among the Latin American and Caribbean States to be filled.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, we shall proceed now to the next round of balloting by secret ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">This fifth round of balloting, which is in accordance with rule 94 of the rules of procedure, will also be the third unrestricted ballot.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">May I remind the Assembly that any Member State from among the Latin American and Caribbean States may be a candidate except those outgoing members and those already members of the Security Council. To make this clear, I shall mention the names of those members which cannot be voted for in the present balloting, namely, Argentina and Peru.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">Before we begin the voting process, I should like to remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on the actual conduct of the voting.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa07">We shall now begin the voting process.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa08">Ballot papers marked "B" will now be distributed. May I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers marked "B" for the Latin American and Caribbean States the name of the one State for which they wish to vote. Ballot papers marked "B" will be declared invalid if they contain the name of more than one State.</p>
