	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to <a href="../pdf/S-2006-516.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2006/516</a>, which contains a letter dated 12 July 2006 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General, who organized the high-level meeting in Yamoussoukro on 5 July 2006. It urges all Ivorian parties to implement, in close liaison with the Impartial Forces, all their commitments taken on this occasion concerning the identification operations, the establishment of a monitoring group on the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, the completion of the pre-cantonment process, the adjustment to the electoral code, the dismantling of militias and the establishment of a code of conduct for the media, and urges them in particular to meet the agreed deadlines.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council urges also all Ivorian parties to accelerate the implementation of the road map in order to create the conditions indispensable for the holding of free, open, fair and transparent elections by 31 October.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council calls on the International Working Group (IWG) to monitor the full implementation of the decisions taken by all Ivorian parties in Yamoussoukro on 5 July 2006 and to report to it on its assessment in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council underlines that it is fully prepared to impose targeted measures against persons to be designated by the Committee established by paragraph 14 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1572 (2004)</a> who are determined to be, among other things, blocking the implementation of the peace process -- including by attacking or obstructing the action of UNOCI, of the French forces which support it, of the High Representative for the elections or of the IWG -- responsible for serious violations of human rights and international law committed in Côte d'Ivoire since 19 September 2002, inciting publicly hatred and violence or in violation of the arms embargo, as provided in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1572 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1643(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1643 (2005)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to call a meeting on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire in September 2006 to take stock of the situation and to make any further determinations as may be needed. In this regard, it requests the Secretary-General to report to it before the September meeting on the obstacles remaining to the implementation of the road map and on those responsible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the IWG and endorses its eighth final communiqué dated 23 June 2006. It reiterates its full support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the High Representative for the Elections."</p>
