	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">I should like at the outset of the meeting to extend, on behalf of the Council, a warm welcome to the new Permanent Representative of Italy to the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata. We look forward to cooperating closely with him. I give the floor to Ambassador Terzi di Sant'Agata.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Terzi di Sant'Agata</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">Allow me, Mr. President, to thank you for your kind words of welcome and to express my warm greetings to the other members of the Security Council. It is a great honour for me to commence my duties as the Permanent Representative of Italy to the United Nations here in the Security Council. I hardly need to emphasize the importance that the Italian Government attaches to the decisive action that the Council can and must carry out in the framework of the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">I say these words at a time at which it is crucial that the Council be unified if it is to fulfil its role in promoting solutions to international crises in various parts of the world in a manner that is true to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and consistent with international law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa03">The world looks to the Security Council with high expectations, and I believe that all of us can rise to those expectations by promoting effective solutions, built on consensus. It is therefore in that spirit of continuity that I shall represent my country as a Council member elected by the General Assembly in these concluding months of the biennium of our membership.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa01">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the twin suicide terrorist attacks that occurred in Wah Cantt, Pakistan, on 21 August 2008 causing numerous deaths and injuries.

	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa04">"The Security Council further reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. The Council reminds States that they must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk12-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its determination to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations."</p>
