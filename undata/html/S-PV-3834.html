	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1997-824.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/824</a>, letter dated 28 October 1997 from the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the texts of the communiqué and the six-month peace plan for Sierra Leone of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which were issued at the conclusion of the meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the ECOWAS Committee of Five with the delegation representing Major Johnny Paul Koromah, held at Conakry on 22 and 23 October 1997; and <a href="../pdf/S-1997-886.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/886</a>, letter dated 13 November 1997 from the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council recalls its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1132(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1132 (1997)</a> of 8 October 1997 and the statements of its President of 27 May 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-29.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/29</a>), 11 July 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-36.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/36</a>) and 6 August 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-42.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/42</a>) in response to the military coup in Sierra Leone on 25 May 1997. It reiterates its condemnation of the overthrow of the democratically elected Government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and its concern about the threat to peace, security and stability in the region which the situation in Sierra Leone continues to present.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its full support and appreciation for the continued efforts of the Committee of Five on Sierra Leone of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to seek a peaceful settlement of the crisis and the restoration of the democratically elected Government and constitutional order. In this regard, it welcomes the peace plan agreed in Conakry on 23 October 1997 between the ECOWAS Committee and representatives of the junta as set out in the documents issued after the meeting (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-824.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/824</a>, annexes I and II). It also notes with satisfaction President Kabbah's acceptance of the peace plan in his statement of 5 November 1997 (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-886.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/886</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council calls upon the junta to fulfil its obligations under the peace plan, and in particular the ongoing maintenance of the ceasefire. It calls upon all parties concerned to work for the early and effective implementation of the peace plan, and encourages the ECOWAS Committee to cooperate closely with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council takes note with appreciation of the briefing on the outcome of the meeting in Conakry on 23 October 1997 provided to its members in New York by representatives of the ECOWAS Committee on 11 November 1997. It expresses its readiness to consider how it can support the implementation of the peace plan, and looks forward to early recommendations from the Secretary-General on the role the United Nations could play to that end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council reiterates the need for the provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance in response to local needs, and calls upon the junta to ensure its safe delivery to its intended recipients. It urges all States and relevant international organizations to continue to assist those countries dealing with the influx of refugees caused by the crisis in Sierra Leone.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council reminds all States of their obligation to comply strictly with the embargo on the sale or supply of petroleum and petroleum products and arms and related <i>matériel</i>of all types to Sierra Leone, and with the other measures imposed by its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1132(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1132 (1997)</a>."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1997-52.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1997/52</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
