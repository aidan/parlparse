	Mr. Al-Naman (Saudi Arabia)
</span>
<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p">I have the honour today of introducing to the General Assembly the reports of the Sixth Committee on the 16 agenda items allocated to it: items 159 to 168, 170, 172 to 174, 176 and sub-item (f) of item 21.</div>
	<div class="p">I call the Assembly's attention to agenda item 159, entitled "United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law". The relevant report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-586">A/56/586</a>. The draft resolution that the Sixth Committee recommends to the General Assembly is reproduced in paragraph 7 of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would, inter alia, approve the guidelines and recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General, which provide for the award of a number of international law fellowships and travel grants both in 2002 and 2003. The Assembly would further request the Secretary-General to continue to provide the necessary resources to the budget for programme assistance for the next biennium.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution under item 159 without a vote. I hope the Assembly will be in a position to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I call the Assembly's attention to agenda item 160, entitled "Convention on jurisdictional immunities of States and their property". The relevant report of the Committee is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-587">A/56/587</a> and Corr.1, and the draft resolution recommended for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 7 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would decide that the Ad Hoc Committee on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, established pursuant to <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-55-150">resolution 55/150</a> of 12 December 2000, would meet from 4 to 15 February 2002. It would also request the Ad Hoc Committee to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session on the outcome of its work.</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolution was adopted by the Sixth Committee without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will be in a position to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 161, "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-fourth session". The relevant report of the Sixth Committee on this agenda item is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-588">A/56/588</a> and Corr.1. The Sixth Committee recommends to the General Assembly for adoption the three draft resolutions contained in paragraph 15 thereof and the draft decision found in paragraph 16 of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the first draft resolution, entitled "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-fourth session", the General Assembly would, inter alia, take note of the report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) on the work of its thirty-fourth session, and, after expressing its appreciation to the Commission's secretariat for the publication and distribution of the <i>Legislative Guide on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects</i>, call upon the secretariat to ensure wide dissemination of the <i>Legislative Guide</i>, and invite States to give favourable consideration to its provisions when revising or adopting legislation in that area.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly would also request the Secretary-General to adjust the terms of reference of the UNCITRAL Trust Fund for Symposia, so as to make it possible for the resources in the Trust Fund to be also used for the financing of training and technical assistance activities undertaken by the Secretariat. It would also reaffirm the mandate of the Commission to coordinate legal activities in the field of international trade law and stress the importance of bringing into effect the conventions emanating from the work of the Commission.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the operative paragraphs of the second draft resolution, entitled "Model Law on Electronic Signatures of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law", the General Assembly would express its appreciation to UNCITRAL for completing and adopting the Model Law on Electronic Signatures contained in the annex to the draft resolution and for preparing the Guide to Enactment of the Model Law. It would also, inter alia, recommend that all States give favourable consideration to the Model Law, together with the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, when they enact or revise their laws, in view of the need for uniformity of the law applicable to alternatives to paper-based forms of communication, storage and authentication of information.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the operative part of the third draft resolution entitled "United Nations Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade", the General Assembly would, after expressing its appreciation to UNCITRAL for preparing the draft Convention on the Assignment of Receivables in International Trade, adopt and open for signature or accession the Convention, which is annexed to the draft resolution, and would call upon all Governments to consider becoming party thereto.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted these three draft resolutions without a vote. The Assembly may wish to do so as well.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee also recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of the draft decision found in paragraph 16 of its report. Under the draft decision, the General Assembly would defer consideration of and decision on the enlargement of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law to its fifty-seventh session under the item entitled "Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-fifth session". The Sixth Committee adopted the draft decision without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 162, "Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its fifty-third session". The relevant report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-589">A/56/589</a> and Corr.1, and the draft resolutions recommended to the General Assembly for adoption are contained in paragraph 10.</div>
	<div class="p">By draft resolution I, the General Assembly would, inter alia, express its appreciation to the International Law Commission for the work accomplished at its fifty-third session, in particular for the completion of the final draft articles on "Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts" and for the valuable work done on the issue of prevention on the topic of "International Liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law" (prevention of transboundary harm from hazardous activities).</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would also request the Commission to resume, during its fifty-fourth session, its consideration of the liability aspects of the topic "International liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law", bearing in mind the interrelationship between prevention and liability, and taking into account the developments in international law and comments by Governments.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would also request the International Law Commission to begin to work on the topic "Responsibility of international organizations" and to give further consideration to the remaining topics to be included in its long-term programme of work.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would reiterate the invitation to Governments to respond to the questionnaire and requests for materials on unilateral acts of States circulated by the Secretariat and to submit the most relevant national legislation, decisions of domestic courts and State practice relevant to "Diplomatic protection".</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly would furthermore decide that the next session of the Commission shall be held at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 29 April to 7 June and from 22 July to 16 August 2002.</div>
	<div class="p">By draft resolution II, entitled "Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts", the General Assembly would welcome the conclusion of the work of the International Law Commission on this topic and the adoption by the Commission of draft articles and a detailed commentary. The Assembly would also take note of the articles on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts and commend them to the attention of Governments without prejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action. Finally, the Assembly would decide to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session an item entitled "Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts".</div>
	<div class="p">The draft resolutions were adopted without a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly, too, will adopt the draft resolutions without a vote.</div>
	<div class="p">Let me now turn to agenda item 163, "Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country". The report of the Sixth Committee on this item is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-590">A/56/590</a> and Corr.1. The draft resolution recommended to the Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 8 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, endorse the recommendations and conclusions of the Host Country Committee, express the view that the maintenance of appropriate conditions for the normal work of the delegations and missions accredited to the United Nations and the observance of their privileges and immunities is in the interest of the United Nations and all Member States, and request the host country to continue to take all measures necessary to prevent any interference with the functioning of missions.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would express its appreciation for the efforts made by the host country and hope that the issues raised at the meetings of the Host Country Committee will continue to be resolved in a spirit of cooperation and in accordance with international law. It would also note that the Committee anticipates that the host country, pursuant to applicable agreements, will continue to ensure the issuance, in a timely fashion, of entry visas to representatives of Member States for the purpose of their attending official United Nations meetings, and request the host country to continue to take steps to resolve the problems relating to the parking of diplomatic vehicles in a fair, balanced and non-discriminatory way.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly will be in a position to act likewise.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee under agenda item 164, "Establishment of the International Criminal Court". The report is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-591">A/56/591</a>. The draft resolution recommended to the General Assembly is found in paragraph 10 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolutions, the General Assembly would, inter alia, call upon all States that have signed the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to consider ratifying or acceding to it. The Assembly would also welcome the important work accomplished by the Preparatory Commission on the completion of a great number of parts of its mandate and request the Secretary-General to reconvene the Commission, in accordance with resolution F, adopted by the Rome Conference, from 8 to 19 April and from 1 to 12 July 2002 to continue to carry out the mandate of the resolution. Moreover, the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to undertake the preparations necessary to convene, in accordance with article 112, paragraph 1 of the Rome Statute, the meeting of the Assembly of States Parties to be held at United Nations Headquarters upon the entry into force of the Statute.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote and it is hoped that the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now draw the attention of the Assembly to agenda item 165, entitled "Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization". The report of the Sixth Committee on this item is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-592">A/56/592</a>. The Sixth Committee recommends for adoption by the General Assembly two draft resolutions, which are contained in paragraph 13 of the report.</div>
	<div class="p">By the terms of draft resolution I, entitled "Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization", the General Assembly would, inter alia, request the Special Committee, at its next session from 18 to 28 March 2002, to continue its consideration of all proposals concerning the question of the maintenance of international peace and security in all its aspects in order to strengthen the role of the United Nations. The Special Committee would also be requested to continue to consider on a priority basis the question of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter, by, among other things, commencing substantive debate on all of the related reports of the Secretary-General.</div>
	<div class="p">In addition, the Assembly would request the Special Committee to continue its work on the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes between States and to continue to consider proposals concerning the Trusteeship Council. Furthermore, the Special Committee would be requested to continue to consider, on a priority basis, ways and means of improving its working methods and enhancing its efficiency.</div>
	<div class="p">By the provisions of draft resolution II, entitled "Implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions", the General Assembly would, inter alia, renew its invitation to the Security Council to consider the establishment of further mechanisms or procedures, as appropriate, for consultations as early as possible under Article 50 of the Charter with third States affected by the application of sanctions under Chapter VII. It would welcome the measures taken by the Security Council since the adoption of General Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-50-51">resolution 50/51</a> and strongly recommend that the Council continue its efforts to further enhance the effectiveness and transparency of the sanctions committees. Moreover, it would invite the Council, its sanctions committees and the Secretariat to continue to ensure, as appropriate, that pre-assessment and ongoing assessment reports include analyses of the impact of sanctions on third States; that third States affected are provided opportunities to brief sanctions committees; that the Secretariat continues to provide, upon request, advice and information to third States seeking assistance; and that, in situations where economic sanctions have had severe effects on third States, a special representative could be appointed or a fact-finding mission dispatched to assess the situation. It would also request the Secretary-General to ensure that the competent units within the Secretariat develop the adequate capacity and appropriate modalities to collate and coordinate information on international assistance available to such third States.</div>
	<div class="p">The General Assembly would welcome the report of the Secretary-General containing a summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting of 1998 and would request the Secretary-General to expedite the preparation of a report to the Assembly containing his views on the deliberations and main findings of that meeting.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would decide to consider, within the Sixth Committee or a working group of the Committee, at its fifty-seventh session, further progress in the elaboration of effective measures aimed at the implementation of the provisions of the Charter related to assistance to third States affected by sanctions.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted these two draft resolutions without a vote. The Assembly may wish to do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to agenda item 166, "Measures to eliminate international terrorism". As members know, the General Assembly decided at its current session to convene an initial debate on this item in plenary and to allocate the relevant legal and technical aspects to the Sixth Committee. The report of the Sixth Committee is contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-593">A/56/593</a>. The draft resolution recommended to the General Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph 11 thereof.</div>
	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, strongly condemn all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever and by whomsoever committed. In addition, the Assembly would urge all States that have not yet done so to consider, as a matter of priority, and in accordance with Security Council <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/S-RES-1373-2001">resolution 1373 (2001)</a>, becoming parties to relevant conventions and protocols. The draft resolution would also urge States to cooperate with the Secretary-General and with one another, as well as with interested intergovernmental organizations, with a view to ensuring, where appropriate within existing mandates, that technical and other expert advice is provided to those States requiring and requesting assistance in becoming parties to the conventions and protocols previously referred to. The Assembly would also urge all States and the Secretary-General, in their efforts to prevent international terrorism, to make best use of the existing institutions of the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">Furthermore, the Assembly would decide that the Ad Hoc Committee established by <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-51-210">resolution 51/210</a> of 17 December 1996 should continue to elaborate a comprehensive convention as a matter of urgency and should continue its efforts to resolve the outstanding issues relating to the elaboration of a draft international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. The Ad Hoc Committee would also keep on its agenda the question of convening a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to formulate a joint organized response of the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.</div>
	<div class="p">The Assembly would further decide that the Ad Hoc Committee should meet from 28 January to 1 February 2002 and that the work should also continue, if necessary, during the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, within the framework of a working group of the Sixth Committee.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote. It is hoped the Assembly will do the same.</div>
	<div class="p">I now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee on agenda item 167, "Scope of legal protection under the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel", contained in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-594">A/56/594</a> and Corr.1.

	<div class="p">Under the terms of the draft resolution, the Assembly would, inter alia, express its deep concern regarding the increasing dangers and security risks faced by United Nations and associated personnel, in particular locally recruited personnel, at the field level, and, mindful of the need to provide the fullest possible protection for their security, would call upon all States to consider becoming parties to and to respect fully their obligations under the relevant international instruments, in particular the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel. It would also recommend that the Secretary-General continue to seek the inclusion of relevant provisions of the Convention in the status-of-forces and status-of-mission agreements concluded by the United Nations.</div>
	<div class="p">By operative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution, the Assembly would establish an Ad Hoc Committee open to all Member States or members of the specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency to consider the recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report on measures to strengthen and enhance the protective legal regime for United Nations and associated personnel. The Ad Hoc Committee would meet from 1 to 5 April 2002 and would submit a report on its work to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.</div>
	<div class="p">The Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will do the same.</div>

The Ad Hoc Committee would meet twice in 2002, the second time in the framework of a working group of the Sixth Committee, to consider the elaboration of a mandate for the negotiation of such an international convention.

	<div class="p">The most important achievement of the Sixth Committee at the fifty-sixth regular session of the United Nations General Assembly has been the adoption, without a vote, of the draft resolution on measures to eliminate international terrorism. This unanimity clearly and sincerely indicates the international community's determination to suppress this dangerous phenomenon in all its forms and manifestations, a position supported by all divine revealed religions.

	<div class="p">Other achievements of the Sixth Committee include the adoption of the draft Convention on Assignment of Receivables in International Trade, and the draft Model Law on Electronic Signatures, adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law at its thirty-fourth session.</div>

	<div class="p">The Kingdom's contribution to the work of the General Assembly's Committees reflects its sincere desire to share positions and views with the world community in building a mechanism for realizing the aims of the Charter. My country will continue its efforts in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p">In conclusion, I wish to express our gratitude to Ambassador Pierre Lelong, Chairman of the Sixth Committee, and to its Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Siddig Abdalla of the delegation of the Sudan, Mr. Alexander Marschik of the delegation of Austria, and Mr. Zsolt Hetesy of the delegation of Hungary.

	<div class="p">I am speaking on behalf of Rear Admiral Angrisano, President of the Directing Committee of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). Admiral Angrisano sends his regrets at not being here to address the Assembly personally on this important occasion.</div>
	<div class="p">The IHO is very grateful to the General Assembly for having endorsed the recommendation of the Sixth Committee to grant observer status to the IHO in the General Assembly as it appears in document <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-56-597">A/56/597</a>. We also wish to thank the Government of the Principality of Monaco, host country of the IHO, for taking the initiative of presenting this proposal to the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p">As members know, the IHO is an intergovernmental consultative and technical organization governed by a convention that was registered at the United Nations on 22 September 1970. The objectives of the organization are to coordinate the activities of national hydrographic offices, encourage the greatest possible uniformity in nautical charts, support the adoption of reliable and efficient methods of carrying out and exploiting hydrographic surveys, and advance the development of the sciences in the field of hydrography and the techniques employed in descriptive oceanography.</div>
	<div class="p">The IHO is fully committed to implementing United Nations resolutions related to the Law of the Sea Convention. Our work, which is aimed at achieving adequate global hydrographic data coverage, contributes significantly to the safety of navigation and to the protection of the marine environment. Without systematic collection and evaluation of the data related to coastal topography, aids to navigation, bathymetry, tides and currents, it is impossible to produce reliable navigational charts. Scientists and administrators also need adequate parameters to study and take measures for marine environmental management.</div>
	<div class="p">The profile of the IHO is as follows. At present, the IHO counts 70 member States, plus 8 pending. All the main maritime States are IHO members and employ thousands of personnel in their national hydrographic offices throughout the world. The survey fleet totals approximately 350 ships, plus a considerable number of survey launches and some aircraft. Forty member States provide training courses for national and international students, and one international maritime academy provides training courses for developing countries. Three member States produce a world-wide nautical chart portfolio. These are 15 regional hydrographic commissions to look after the local development of hydrography, and 20 committees and working groups to produce and update standards and develop the International Hydrographic Organization strategies.</div>
	<div class="p">The IHO is fully committed to the development of hydrography in regions such as Africa, Central America, the Middle East, East Asia and Eastern Europe.</div>
	<div class="p">The IHO membership is open to all countries, and new members are most welcome to join. The development of hydrography and charting significantly benefits countries which have under their jurisdiction sea and internal waters, supporting national and international trade and transportation. Membership also contributes to preservation of the marine environment, in view of various sustainable development activities such as tourism and exploitation of living and mineral resources.</div>
	<div class="p">The IHO cooperates on an ongoing basis with the United Nations and its specialized agencies and actively participates in their meetings, conferences and assemblies. We recognize the importance of the invitation made to the IHO by the United Nations membership as it appears in paragraph 33 of Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-56-12.pdf">resolution 56/12</a> of 28 November 2001.</div>
	<div class="p">I would like to conclude by simply reiterating our thanks to the entire membership of the General Assembly for granting the IHO the observer status that will enable it to strengthen its cooperation with all interested nations.</div>
