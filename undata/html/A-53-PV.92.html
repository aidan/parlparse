Our delegation believes that we have a duty to work with our partners here in the General Assembly to assist and support reform efforts to be undertaken by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Commission on Human Settlements. Full consideration of this agenda item cannot be delayed. As such, we would like to join our partners in regular and transparent consultations aimed at moving the reform process forward. My delegation strongly believes that a failure to do so, or to adopt a decision calling for the same in this body, would unnecessarily delay reform efforts undertaken by UNEP and the Commission, which would be to the grave detriment of their continuing operation.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa02">The African Group, meeting in plenary, decided to submit this draft resolution, which is one of the group of resolutions dealing with humanitarian situations in Africa.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa03">The draft resolution, while noting with appreciation the increased contributions for 1998 in response to the inter-agency appeal for the Sudan, emphasizes the considerable relief needs that remain to be addressed, in particular in the area of food and of the fight against various illnesses and epidemics.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa04">The draft resolution draws attention to the disastrous consequences of the floods that occurred in various parts of the country in 1998. While calling for an early resolution to the conflict in order to put an end to the suffering of the civilian population, the draft resolution reaffirms the need for all parties to continue to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations in the supply of food and medicines to affected peoples in remote areas.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa05">The draft resolution acknowledges with appreciation the cooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the United Nations with a view to facilitating relief operations in the affected areas, and it encourages the continuation of that cooperation. The General Assembly also expresses its appreciation to the donor community, United Nations agencies and governmental and non-governmental organizations for their past and future contributions to the humanitarian needs of the Sudan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa06">While recognizing the need for neutrality and impartiality in humanitarian activities, the draft resolution stresses that Operation Lifeline Sudan should operate within the principle of national sovereignty and the framework of international cooperation in accordance with the provisions of international law. The draft resolution also calls upon the donor community and the agencies of the United Nations system to provide financial, medical and technical assistance and substantially to increase, to the extent possible, such assistance to combat diseases and epidemics in the Sudan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa07">The draft resolution stresses the imperative of ensuring the safety of humanitarian personnel as well as the need for access to remote areas in order to provide relief to all affected populations, while observing the principles and guidelines of Operation Lifeline Sudan and of international humanitarian law.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa08">Finally, the draft resolution welcomes the signing by the Government of the Sudan of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Landmines and on Their Destruction, and urges all parties to the conflict to desist from using them. It also calls on the international community to refrain from supplying mines to parties in conflict in the region and to make every effort to provide the necessary demining assistance to the Sudan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa09">I have the pleasure of informing the Assembly that this draft resolution is the result of intensive and painstaking consultations with the donor countries under the chairmanship of Ambassador Jørgen Bøjer, Permanent Representative of Denmark and coordinator of humanitarian resolutions under agenda item 20, and I thank him on behalf of the Group of African States and in particular on behalf of the Sudan.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa10">This text was agreed upon by all the delegations providing humanitarian assistance to the Sudan, in particular the countries of the European Union, the United States, Canada, Norway, Australia and Japan. I should like, on behalf of the African Group, to thank all of those countries for their constructive contribution to the drafting of this text, which, I hope, will be adopted by the Assembly by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk13-pa11">In so doing, the Assembly will demonstrate once again its support for and its solidarity with the Sudan, which is currently affected by a very alarming humanitarian situation.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa01">My delegation joins consensus on the resolution concerning humanitarian assistance to the Sudan because of the need to ensure that the international community is sufficiently seized with the humanitarian tragedy affecting that country. We continue to have concerns about the Government of the Sudan's cooperation in facilitating the delivery of relief assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The United States recalls that Sudan's denial of flight clearances to Bahr-el-Ghazal in February through April of this year contributed to the devastating famine that placed 2.5 million Sudanese at risk of starvation. We urge the Government of Sudan to ensure this does not happen again. We call on Khartoum to fulfil its commitment at the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace talks in May to provide free and unhindered access for the delivery of humanitarian supplies, as called for in the resolution adopted today.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa03">In specific terms, that includes the following: granting clearances for all relief flights on a timely basis or explaining clearly why any have been refused; providing access for a United Nations assessment team to the Nuba Mountains -- then-Foreign Minister Taha agreed to do so in a meeting with Secretary-General Annan in May 1998, and Khartoum reaffirmed that offer at the August peace talks, yet that commitment remains unfulfilled; fulfilling its commitment to provide ten thousand metric tons of food commodities to the relief effort, particularly given the fact that Sudan exports one million tons of sorghum annually; simplifying the monthly procedure for relief flights, making it easier for relief workers to travel to affected areas, and instituting a clear policy on communications equipment for humanitarian personnel.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa04">We also urge the Government of the Sudan to implement fully the agreements signed with the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) in Rome in mid-November, providing for increased security for relief workers and providing a framework for increased use of rail corridors and cross-line food deliveries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa05">The situation in southern Sudan is one of the world's most devastating humanitarian tragedies. The resolution adopted today can help lead to an improvement of that situation, provided the Government of Sudan takes significant and concrete steps towards facilitating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all those who need it.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Finally, the United States delegation would like to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the Permanent Representative of Denmark, Ambassador Jørgen Bøjer, in guiding us to the carefully negotiated consensus on this resolution.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa01">The European Union appreciates that it was possible to adopt the resolution "Emergency assistance to the Sudan" without a vote, thereby discontinuing a pattern of disagreement on resolutions on this subject over recent years.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa02">The European Union considers that the text before us is a marked improvement with regard to previous years. It takes the situation on the ground into consideration and reflects agreements on international humanitarian law and principles. The European Union hopes that the consensus reached will have a positive impact on the work of Operation Lifeline Sudan and of other international humanitarian organizations in the Sudan, and on the efforts of all parties to the conflict to achieve a lasting peaceful solution. In this context, the European Union calls for an early resolution of the conflict and expresses grave concern about the threat to and suffering of the civilian population, which undermines the effectiveness of international, regional and national humanitarian assistance.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa03">The European Union attaches particular importance to the emphasis in the resolution on the need for Operation Lifeline Sudan to be operated and managed with a view to ensuring its efficiency, transparency and effectiveness. We also welcome the reference in the resolution to the role of the Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in strengthening the coordination of Operation Lifeline Sudan. While acknowledging the progress made in this respect in some areas, we expect to see further improvements in the management and operation of Operation Lifeline Sudan in the months ahead.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk03-pa04">The European Union was working intensively to achieve a consensus on this resolution and thanks all negotiating partners for the spirit of cooperation shown during negotiations. I want to thank, in particular, Ambassador Jørgen Bøjer of Denmark, who has coordinated all resolutions under this item and has put considerable time and effort into finding an agreement on this resolution.</div>

	Ms. McVey (Canada)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Canada is pleased that after two years the resolution on emergency assistance to the Sudan has been adopted by consensus.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa02">In any negotiation there is a process of give and take, of compromise and agreement, and this is understood by all delegations. It is the position of the delegation of Canada that any change in the management of Operation Lifeline Sudan is subject to the concurrence of all the signatories to the agreement establishing Operation Lifeline Sudan, and its management and operation should be conducted accordingly. Likewise, we believe that Operation Lifeline Sudan should be conducted in a non-political manner and in strict accordance with humanitarian principles. We note with satisfaction that this year's text makes solid reference to the importance of safe and unhindered access by humanitarian workers to all populations in need.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa03">As Operation Lifeline Sudan constitutes the basic framework for humanitarian assistance to the Sudan, it is therefore paramount that all parties in the Sudan operate in accordance with the 1994 tripartite Agreements and that the principles and guidelines of Operation Lifeline Sudan, as well as the principles contained in the annex to General Assembly <a class="nolink" href="../pdf/A-RES-46-182">resolution 46/182</a>, are duly respected by all parties to ensure the efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, impartiality and neutrality of the operation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa04">As in the past, Canada will continue to fully support the humanitarian work of Operation Lifeline Sudan. We have been encouraged by recent developments such as the October extension of the humanitarian ceasefire and the November signing of the security and transportation protocols by all parties in Rome. In this regard, we urge the Government of the Sudan to extend the ceasefire in terms of duration and of geographic boundaries to include the region of the Nuba mountains. In recognizing that the humanitarian situation in the Sudan is the result of the ongoing civil war, we urge all parties to the conflict to seek its early resolution.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa05">We proffer our gratitude to the delegation of Denmark, and in particular to Ambassador Jørgen Bøjer for the very constructive role he played as facilitator in these negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg005-bk01-pa06">It is the belief of my delegation that humanitarian assistance is most effective when national, regional and international efforts converge. Only through concerted action and international cooperation can the obstacles to the provision of humanitarian assistance to all populations in need be overcome.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa01">It is an honour to present for the consideration of the Assembly the draft decision entitled "Non-governmental organizations", as contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-53-L.68.pdf">A/53/L.68</a>.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa02">As requested in last year's decision 52/453 on this very same topic, the Secretary-General prepared a report on the arrangements and practices for the interaction of non-governmental organizations in all activities of the United Nations system. His report provided a much needed basis of pertinent information and analysis, as well as a good overview of existing institutional arrangements for the participation of non-governmental organizations in the United Nations system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa03">In considering next steps, my delegation endeavoured to consult as widely as possible with all interested parties, delegations and non-governmental organizations alike. It was generally agreed that the Secretary-General should be requested to solicit the views of States, members of specialized agencies, observers, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations from all regions on the broad range of aspects on the question of the participation of non-governmental organizations in the United Nations system, and subsequently to prepare a follow-up report to circulate to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa04">This is the essential purpose of the draft decision before the Assembly. It would be my delegation's hope and expectation that the Secretary-General's follow-up report would equip the Assembly to consider concrete measures next year to enhance the cooperation between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa05">I wish to thank all our partners for their contributions and engagement in this issue. The collaboration and commitment expressed by all portend well for strengthened collaboration between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations from all parts of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa06">With these brief comments, I am honoured to commend the draft decision before us for the Assembly's adoption by consensus, as agreed during informal consultations.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk08-pa01">Members will recall that at its 84th plenary meeting, on 9 December 1998, the General Assembly decided that the fifty-third session should recess on 17 December 1998.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk08-pa02">However, as the Fifth Committee, despite its best efforts, has not been able to complete its work, the Assembly will not be able to conclude its work today, 17 December 1998.

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk10-pa01">Statement by the President</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk11">
<span class="speaker" name="The President" nation="" language="Spanish">
	The President
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa01">As this is the last meeting over which I will preside in 1998, before we continue our work next year, I should like to take this opportunity to make a statement in my capacity as President of the General Assembly. I do not wish to make a lengthy closing statement, but simply to offer a review of sorts of some of the aspects of our work before we return to our countries and homes.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa02">I think we can feel legitimate satisfaction about the work we have done. Both in the plenary meetings of the Assembly and in its Committees, the pace of our work has been very intense and has often demanded very long and tiring days of delegations. However, the results are gratifying.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa03">The General Assembly had 168 items on its agenda, and up until 15 December had adopted 250 resolutions and 70 decisions during this first part of the fifty-third session, the content of many of which was politically significant. It would not be appropriate for us to evaluate our work at this point, but I would at least like to refer to some elements of the environment in which that work took place.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa04">The first element is the ongoing dire financial situation of the United Nations, despite which the Organization nevertheless continues to survive and carry out its commitments. Unfortunately, this factor has not been a characteristic solely of this session. It has been dragging on for several years. Needless to say, this has a negative effect on the work and results of deliberations on several important issues. We hope that the most important States in arrears will soon make their required payments without conditions and that future sessions will not take place under the tyranny of financial limitations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa05">On the other hand, a great spirit of cooperation and compromise on the part of all delegations prevailed in our deliberations. Thanks to that spirit of cooperation, even controversial deliberations were carried out without serious problems. Although delegations put forward and defended their positions energetically and some tensions arose at times, there was always an effort to find consensus and reconciliation of opposing interests. Proof of this is the fact that there have been 190 adoptions by consensus to date at this session. For this I wish in particular to thank all delegations and congratulate them on that spirit of cooperation, which we hope will spread throughout the entire Organization.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa06">Perhaps I can single out some of the resolutions adopted at this session as illustrations of the spirit of understanding and tolerance that seems to be progressively permeating the international community. I am speaking of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-22.pdf">resolution 53/22</a>, on dialogue among civilizations. In adopting this resolution the General Assembly opened up another path towards strengthening understanding and solidarity among the peoples of the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa07">Similarly, <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-30.pdf">resolution 53/30</a>, on the question of equitable representation on the Security Council, can also be taken as an example of how much can be achieved when there is genuine will to understand each other and to make reciprocal concessions through compromise. I need not point out the importance and extreme complexity of the issue of equitable representation on the Security Council. Of course, there was no expectation of making spectacular progress on the substance of this issue at this session. I do hope that progress can be made in that direction next year in the meetings of the Open-ended Working Group. But <a href="../pdf/A-RES-53-30.pdf">resolution 53/30</a>, which was adopted by the General Assembly by consensus and whose importance is in inverse proportion to its brevity, will undoubtedly be a contributing element to establishing a climate of mutual confidence and thus promote the development of what I hope will be fruitful negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa08">We should stress that the General Assembly has paid particular attention to questions of peace and security on the African continent.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa09">With the adoption of the resolution on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa, the General Assembly not only confirmed the particular interest and concern of the entire international community about current problems in that region, but also tried to contribute effectively to improving this situation.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa10">Unfortunately, this year nature demonstrated its violent side in many parts of the world. The General Assembly has responded to the best of its undoubtedly limited abilities, but in any case the resolutions it has adopted bear witness to the international community's very strong sense of solidarity, which has withstood all these disasters.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa11">In the areas of disarmament and international security, interest was focused, quite naturally, on nuclear issues because of events that took place this year in this field. All are aware of this. Among the 48 resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the First Committee, I wish to emphasize that condemning nuclear testing in South-East Asia, entitled "Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new agenda".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa12">Once again this year, a resolution was also adopted that opens the way for the convening of the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. The consensus adoption of this resolution showed the world's readiness for such a session. We hope that any remaining reservations in this respect can be overcome and that the special session on disarmament can be held in the near future.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa13">The number of resolutions adopted on the recommendation of the Second Committee rose to 35; all of these, except one on Palestine, were adopted by consensus. The dominant theme in the Second Committee was globalization. The high-level dialogue that took place in September on this issue undoubtedly contributed to a better understanding of this phenomenon, which seems to be emerging as the main issue for the international community on the eve of the twenty-first century. The resolution adopted in this regard recognizes the central role which the United Nations must play and the need for coordination between the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the international organizations. It highlights the growing acceptance of the fact that the United Nations is the appropriate forum in which to hold a dialogue on development issues, with an impact on the discussions that may take place in the Bretton Woods institutions. The dialogue between the intergovernmental bodies, the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions should continue, exploiting the experience of the high-level meeting of the Economic and Social Council that took place in April this year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa14">Another central issue was that of financing for development. Broad consensus has emerged on the need for genuine cooperation and collaboration in the process and on the urgency of achieving an agreement as soon as possible on the agenda of the Open-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on the high-level intergovernmental consideration of this issue.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa15">In the field of cooperation on social, humanitarian and cultural affairs, 59 resolutions were adopted, most by consensus. Also in this area, concern was expressed about the current economic situation and its negative impact on social development. Several resolutions were adopted with respect to human rights. Among these, we would highlight the adoption of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the resolution confirming commitments undertaken in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. Another resolution that deserves mention is the one on international cooperation against the world drug problem.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa16">In the area of special political and decolonization issues, 27 resolutions were adopted, 12 by consensus. In addition to the resolutions on the usual decolonization issues, the effects of atomic radiation, international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space and questions relating to information, resolutions were adopted on two hotly debated questions: the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and the question of Israeli practices in the occupied territories. The Organization's financial crisis and difficulties in completing the peace process were the aspects most stressed. The Wye River Memorandum brought a positive element to this process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa17">Nothing can be said with respect to administrative and budgetary affairs, since the deliberations have been extended. Of course, the issues addressed, such as the programme budget for the 2000-2001 biennium, the first programme of results for the 1998-1999 biennium, the scale of assessments and other matters eloquently illustrate the complexity of the Fifth Committee's work. Among the issues to be discussed next year are human resources, the development account, the reform of the budgeting system, internal oversight services and all issues related to peacekeeping operations and the United Nations procurement system.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa18">The General Assembly adopted 13 resolutions on the recommendation of the Sixth Committee, among which we would highlight that on assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions. Of particular importance was the adoption of a decision providing for the convening next year of three meetings of the Preparatory Commission for the establishment of the International Criminal Court. Equally important is the resolution confirming a number of principles of international law to be observed in the conduct of negotiations. Other resolutions were adopted on the United Nations Decade of International Law. In this area, the work on one important subject -- the draft convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism -- was not concluded. Most provisions of the draft enjoy general support, but others require additional negotiations. We hope that they will be concluded successfully next year.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa19">This was a year of important celebrations. The fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the occasion for the adoption of two important resolutions: that on the human rights defenders, to which I referred earlier, and that reaffirming the General Assembly's solemn commitment to implementing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations and as a source of inspiration. The General Assembly also celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of peacekeeping operations, which offered us the opportunity to reaffirm that the United Nations continues and should continue to be a fundamental pillar of the maintenance of international peace and security throughout the world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa20">In conclusion -- and I apologize for perhaps having spoken too long -- I wish to return to my initial point. I believe that this has been a fruitful session, for which all members may take credit. I wish particularly to thank the Vice-Presidents, who took my place on many occasions, and the Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen and Rapporteurs of the Committees, who also did excellent work. Of course, we could not have achieved the positive results I have summarized without the invaluable and constant support and professionalism of the staff of the Secretariat and the Department of General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services. I wish in particular to mention the interpreters and translators, who have had to struggle with my Spanish, and the Meetings Coverage Section of the Department of Public Information. To all these, and those whom I have not mentioned, I offer my deep gratitude and that of my team.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk11-pa21">I wish very happy holidays to all and a year full of professional and personal success in 1999. I will return in February, when we shall resume our work with the same determination which we have shown to date.</div>
