	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council condemns with the utmost firmness the seizure of the town of Bukavu, on 2 June 2004, by dissident forces led by former Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD-Goma) commanders Major-General Laurent Nkunda, Colonel Jules Mutebusi and others. It also condemns atrocities and human right violations which have occurred in this context. It declares its profound concern regarding reports of military actions these forces have undertaken in other parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It considers all such actions to constitute a serious threat to the peace process and to the transition, and demands that these cease immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to and respect for the national sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It expresses its solidarity with the Congolese people and its full support to the Government of National Unity and Transition. It calls for the prompt and peaceful extension of State authority throughout the Congolese territory, in particular in Bukavu.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council urges all parties represented in the Government of National Unity and Transition to remain fully committed to the peace process and to abstain from any action that could endanger the unity of the transitional Government.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council warns solemnly the States neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the consequences of support to the armed rebel groups. It urges the Government of Rwanda, taking into account its previous relationship with RCD-Goma, and all other neighbouring States to do all in their power to support the peace process and help secure a peaceful resolution to this crisis, while at the same time refraining from any action or declaration that might impact negatively on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It recalls the terms of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1493(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1493 (2003)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1533(2004).pdf" class="pdf">1533 (2004)</a>, especially those elements relating to regional security across the Great Lakes, and calls upon all member States, in particular those in the region, to fulfil their responsibilities accordingly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the initiative of the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union aimed at overcoming the current crisis, including in its human dimension, and at facilitating the successful conclusion of the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council reiterates its full support to the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). It condemns the recent killing of three of its personnel. It calls on all Congolese parties to support the work of MONUC and demands that they refrain from any hostile action against the personnel or facilities of the United Nations."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-19.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
