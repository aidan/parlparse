	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Terje Roed-Larsen, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1559 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">It is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">I invite Mr. Larsen to take a seat at the Council table.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">I wish to draw the attention of the members to <a href="../pdf/S-2005-673.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/673</a>, containing the text of a letter dated 26 October 2005 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council, transmitting the second semi-annual report on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council recalls all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1559 (2004)</a>, 425 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-426(1978).pdf" class="pdf">426 (1978)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-520(1982).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 520 (1982)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1614(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1614 (2005)</a>, as well as the statements of its President on the situation in Lebanon, in particular the statements of 18 June 2000, of 19 October 2004 and of 4 May 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council reaffirms its strong support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political independence of Lebanon, as well as for the freedom of its press.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the second semi-annual report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council of 26 October 2005 on the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1559 (2004)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council notes that significant further progress has been made towards the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>, in particular through the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon and the holding of free and credible parliamentary elections in May and June 2005, but it notes also with regret that other provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a> have yet to be implemented, particularly the disbanding and disarming of Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias and the extension of Government control over all Lebanese territory, and free and fair presidential elections conducted according to the Lebanese constitutional rules, without foreign interference and influence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"In this context, the Security Council commends the Lebanese Government for the dialogue it has initiated in October 2005 with representatives of Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias, for the steps it has taken towards restoring fully its authority throughout its territory and for its stated willingness to establish full diplomatic relations and representation and to demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria. The Council calls on the Lebanese Government to sustain its efforts to achieve progress on all these issues in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a> and to pursue a broad national dialogue, and the Council calls on all other parties concerned, in particular the Government of Syria, to cooperate to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">"The Security Council notes with concern the report's suggestion that there have been movements of arms and people into Lebanese territory and, in this context, commends the Government of Lebanon for undertaking measures against such movements and calls on the Government of Syria to undertake similar measures.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">"The Security Council condemns the continued terrorist attacks in Lebanon, which have resulted in the death or injury of scores of Lebanese citizens, including several prominent Lebanese figures, as part of a deliberate strategy to destabilize the country and to intimidate the Lebanese people, their Government and their media.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa14">"The Security Council warns that those responsible for such crimes must be held fully accountable and will not be permitted to jeopardize the stability, democracy and national unity of Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa15">"The Security Council reiterates its call for the full implementation of all requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>, and urges all concerned parties to cooperate fully with the Security Council and the Secretary-General to achieve this goal.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa16">"The Security Council commends the Secretary-General as well as his Special Envoy for their efforts and dedication to facilitate and assist in the implementation of all provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1559(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1559 (2004)</a>."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa17">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-3.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/3</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa18">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
