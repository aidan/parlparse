	<p id="docA49PV89-pg001-bk07-pa02">I wish the Government and people of Palau peace, prosperity, happiness and every success for the future.

	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk01-pa01">At a time of uncertainty and upheaval in other aspects of international relations, we are happy today to welcome the Republic of Palau into the great family of Member States of the United Nations. I am very pleased, on behalf of the African States Members of the United Nations, to congratulate this new State and welcome it most warmly. Once again our Organization has proved that with every day that passes it is moving towards universality, which is one of its major goals.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk01-pa02">The Republic of Palau has a long, rich and diverse history and is a country of many cultures, customs and traditions. Nevertheless, it has taken over 200 years for the inhabitants of Palau to be allowed to become masters of their own destiny. In proclaiming their sovereignty on 1 October 1994, the people of Palau gave tangible proof that all countries, large or small, rich or poor, see their destiny as intimately linked to the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We are therefore convinced that Palau's entry into the United Nations will enrich our Organization by further increasing its diversity, because, let us never forget, a civilization encompassing all peoples must be a marriage of all the different civilizations, living in harmony. In this regard, as in other fields, the Republic of Palau has many political, economic and strategic advantages. In the realization of the noble objectives of peace and cooperation between all States, the Republic of Palau can expect the African States Members of the United Nations to be ready to cooperate closely with it on all matters of common interest.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk01-pa03">I could not conclude without asking the delegation of Palau to pass on to the people and Government of Palau the hope of the African Group in New York that Palau's cooperation with the United Nations and its Member States will be fruitful and benefit all peace-loving and justice-loving nations.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk03-pa01">On behalf of the Member States of the Asian Group, I have the honour and privilege of congratulating the Republic of Palau on its admission as the 185th Member of the United Nations. I should also like warmly to welcome Palau to this Organization. The admission of Palau, which was until recently a Trust Territory of the United States, strengthens the principle of universality, upon which the United Nations is based, and which is an important principle for its effective functioning.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk03-pa02">The Republic of Palau encompasses an area of some 178 square miles and has a small population, but it is a significant producer of phosphate, canned fish and agricultural produce. In the last few years we have seen a number of small countries, mainly from Europe, admitted to the United Nations. Today I am particularly pleased to welcome a small State from the Pacific region to the United Nations family.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk03-pa03">Although small States, especially island States like Palau, are especially vulnerable because of their size, their small population and narrow economic base, there is reason to be optimistic about their growth prospects and their viability. The experience of many small countries has shown that, with hard work and far-sighted policies, they can succeed and prosper. However, for their efforts to succeed, the international community has an equal responsibility to assist them. In this regard, I am confident that Palau's membership in the United Nations will enable it to benefit from the assistance that the United Nations and its specialized agencies can offer.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk03-pa04">On its part, Palau will undoubtedly contribute to the work and purposes and principles of the United Nations. The Member States of the Asian Group and other Members of the United Nations as a whole will extend their cooperation to Palau and will work closely with it.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk05-pa01">In my capacity as Chairman of the Group of Eastern European States for this month, I have the honour and the privilege to welcome, on behalf of the members of the Group, the Government and people of Palau on the occasion of that country's admission to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk05-pa02">The admission of a new State is always a demonstration of how the principle of the universality of the United Nations is being furthered. It also demonstrates that all the principles and values embodied in the Charter remain in effect. The broad membership can enhance cooperation between Member States to promote within the framework of the United Nations such noble ideals as peace, freedom, justice and economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk05-pa03">The Group of Eastern European States, many of whose members are also small States, are especially pleased to welcome Palau into the international community. We are convinced that membership will provide the people of Palau with new perspectives and opportunities in the international arena and within the family of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk05-pa04">We are today witnessing a rapid change in our Organization. The United Nations is becoming increasingly involved in resolving political conflicts, fostering economic and social development and ensuring respect for human rights. All Member States, regardless of their size, bear their own responsibilities in this endeavour.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg002-bk05-pa05">We are certain that the Republic of Palau, as a new Member State of the United Nations, will participate actively in the work of our Organization. I can assure the delegation of Palau that the members of the Eastern European Group will be reliable partners. We look forward to working with the Republic of Palau to achieve the noble objectives of the United Nations.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Odlum</span><span class="nation">Saint Lucia</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk02-pa01">The accession of Palau to the General Assembly of the United Nations is a fitting moment for the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States to muse somewhat on the question of size and sovereignty. The Group comprises countries which are as diverse in culture as they are in size and resources. This diversity was celebrated as recently as last weekend, at the Summit of the Americas. All the diversity of the Americas burst out into a new spirit of freedom: freedom to speak, regardless of size; freedom to participate in the processes of justice, humanity and ecological preservation, regardless of size.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk02-pa02">Today we welcome Palau into the United Nations, an institution which traditionally respects not size and resources, but the right of every people, every speck of dust, to participate in the human process of living, expressing views, debating ideas and arriving at the warm glow of consensus. There is a particular significance in the accession of Palau. The significance lies in the fact that Palau, a tiny but strategically located, island in the West Pacific, north of Indonesia, with a population of about 16,000 struck a vibrant cord of dissent in 1982. This small American-administered island held up an agreement for a compact of free association because of the creeping fear that Palau would become a repository for nuclear materials.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk02-pa03">Towards the middle of the 1980s, the United States had clearly begun to pay far more attention to the strategic importance of its Micronesian holdings as bases for use against Soviet threats and for the testing of strategic missiles. This year, at the sixty-first session of the Trusteeship Council, the President of the Republic of Palau was able to report confidently that there was full agreement between the United States and Palau on the Compact of Free Association. A plebiscite was taken, and even the challenges of concerned interests in the courts attest to the fact that democracy is alive and well in Palau.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk02-pa04">The cessation of the cold war has changed the theatre of possibilities that now face the people of Palau, and they can now participate in this forum for free expression, to pursue not only their right to dissent, but also the self-development of their people in the international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk02-pa05">In the new spirit of international cooperation, the Administering Authority itself must be commended for painstakingly taking this Territory through the paces of trusteeship and preparing this small nation to take its place among the nations of the world.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk02-pa06">The Latin American and Caribbean Group warmly welcomes Palau to this distinguished body. We welcome it as it joins this forum, not only to seek a better economic and social advantage for the people of Palau, but to share in the search for truth and sustaining values, and to do so in a spirit of tolerance and freedom of inquiry.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk04-pa01">On behalf of the Group of Western European and Other States, and also of course on behalf of Spain, it is a source of special pleasure for me to express to the Government and people of the Republic of Palau our heartiest congratulations on Palau's admission as a Member State of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk04-pa02">The event that we are celebrating today has especial significance for our Organization and for the full realization of the purposes and principles of the United Nations as set forth in its Charter.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk04-pa03">Indeed, the decision just adopted by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council, is a fitting conclusion to an important chapter in the history of the Organization, a history that was written by the Trusteeship Council.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk04-pa04">Furthermore, the admission of the Republic of Palau, which brings to 185 the number of States Members of the Organization, represents one more step that our Organization has taken towards the full realization of the principle of universality, thereby highlighting the importance of the contribution of all States to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in international peace and security, and in the economic and social development of all peoples.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg003-bk04-pa05">We are fully convinced that the Republic of Palau will make a positive contribution to the realization of the purposes and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter. On behalf of the Group of Western European and Other States, I wish to assure the Republic of Palau of our fullest cooperation in this common undertaking, and to extend to it our best wishes for success in its new role as a Member of the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk02-pa01">In my capacity as representative of the host country, I should like to extend very warm congratulations to the Republic of Palau as it becomes the newest Member of the United Nations family. As the former Administering Authority of the Republic of Palau under the Trusteeship Agreement, the United States was particularly pleased to have sponsored today's resolution and is particularly gratified by the Republic of Palau's acquisition of United Nations membership.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk02-pa02">The adoption of the resolution by which the General Assembly decided to admit the Republic of Palau to the United Nations is a recognition of Palau's sovereignty and independence, and its readiness to take its place in the community of nations. The resolution also marks the successful conclusion of the work of the Trusteeship Council, which, since its establishment, has brought self-determination to the peoples of Trust Territories in all corners of the world.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk02-pa03">We look forward to working with the representatives of the Republic of Palau, who, I am sure, will bring a fresh perspective that will benefit this Organization and all its Members as we work to advance the goals of a peaceful and prosperous international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk02-pa04">Once again, to President Nakamura and his delegation here with us today, and to all the people of Republic of Palau, we say: Welcome to the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa01">I have the honour to address the Assembly in Australia's capacity as current Chair of the South Pacific Forum and on behalf of the nine member States of the Forum which are also Members of the United Nations, namely, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Western Samoa and Australia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa02">The resolution which the General Assembly has just adopted, admitting the Republic of Palau to membership of the United Nations, is a historic one. It is also one which the Member States of the South Pacific Forum warmly welcome.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa03">The General Assembly's action today follows the Security Council's decision on 10 November 1994 that, in the light of the entry into force on 1 October 1994 of the new status agreement for Palau, the objectives of the Trusteeship Agreement had been fully attained, and that the applicability of the Trusteeship Agreement with respect to Palau had terminated. That decision was followed by the unanimous adoption by the Security Council, on 29 November, of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-963(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 963 (1994)</a> recommending that Palau be admitted to membership of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa04">The Security Council's decision to terminate the Trusteeship Agreement was the final stage in the process set in train following the act of self-determination by the people of Palau on 9 November 1993, when they chose to enter into a Compact of Free Association with the United States.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa05">The positive developments that have occurred recently in Palau, in particular the exercise by the people of their right to self-determination, have been followed with close interest and with the full support of the Member States of the South Pacific Forum.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa06">We congratulate the people of Palau on their decision to enter into the Compact of Free Association with the United States. We also wish to congratulate the United States for successfully discharging its obligations under the trusteeship arrangements and for advising the Security Council of the entry into force, on 1 October 1994, of the Compact of Free Association.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa07">We also wish to express our appreciation to the Trusteeship Council for the role that it has performed in support of the exercise by the people of Palau of their right to self-determination and for fully discharging its obligations to Palau under the United Nations Trusteeship System.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa08">Palau, as a country in the Pacific region, already has very close ties with the other Member States of that region. The strength of the relationships that exist was demonstrated by the large attendance at the independence celebrations, on 1 October this year, by representatives from countries from the Asia-Pacific region and by representatives of the United Nations, the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa09">We are confident that these relationships will continue to develop and grow stronger now that Palau has embarked upon a new path as an independent country and as a Member of this family of nations. The countries of the South Pacific, some of which were former Trust Territories that also gained their independence under the United Nations Trusteeship System, are committed to cooperating closely with Palau as it sets out on this new and exciting journey.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa10">We wish the people of Palau success and prosperity in the future as members of the international and regional community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg004-bk04-pa11">Today, we welcome the Republic of Palau most warmly as a Member of the United Nations.</p>

I also wish to thank the members of the General Assembly for voting to admit the Republic of Palau as the 185th Member of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa02">My country, with approximately 20,000 citizens, will be one of the smallest Members of this Organization, but we are large in the things that count: a strong cultural heritage; a commitment to human rights and a democratic government; resources - both human and marine - which we are particularly proud of; and, most of all, the support and friendship of our brothers and sisters in the international family of nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa03">This event today in part celebrates Palau's status as an independent and sovereign nation and its admission as a Member of the United Nations. In that, of course, we take great pride. Our day of independence, 1 October 1994, and this first day of membership in the United Nations are the beginning of a new future for us, as a people and as a nation. At last, after over a century of foreign administration, we control our own destiny and we are again a member of the international community of nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa04">Today also represents the end of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, for which the United Nations established the Trusteeship System after the Second World War. Indeed, this marks symbolically the end of that War. The noble goals of the Trusteeship System -- to further international peace, promote the advancement of the peoples of the Trust Territories and encourage respect for human rights -- have been accomplished. As the Head of State of the last Trust Territory, I offer sincere thanks to all the Members of the United Nations, particularly the members of the Trusteeship Council. Together, we can celebrate a victory for the principle of self-determination and the idea that stronger nations can help others overcome devastation and destruction to recover their nationhood and identity. Thus, the admission to membership in the United Nations of its last Trust Territory is a celebration for that body itself. As that last Trust Territory, we are proud simply to be a participant, and we salute each and every Member of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa05">We are sincerely grateful for the assistance and guidance of the United Nations, together with the United States of America as Administering Authority, during the past 50 years of trusteeship. Even as I speak to this Assembly today, we are nearing completion of a three-year project to develop a master plan for sustainable development in Palau, which has been jointly sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme and the United States of America.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa06">We have already taken a historic step forward in our relationship with the United States by implementing the Compact of Free Association. Our relationship with the United States has always been, and will continue to be, solidly based on mutual friendship, respect and trust. Now we take another historic step forward in our relationship with the United Nations by moving from our status as a Trust Territory to that of a full-fledged fellow Member.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa07">We are eager to develop and strengthen our relations with each Member of the United Nations and the international community. We understand that with our new political status come new responsibilities. We seek friendship with all nations and pledge to abide by the rules of international law. We desire close cooperation with our neighbours in areas of mutual concern and pledge to preserve and protect our shared marine resources. We ask our neighbours to recognize our international borders and we pledge to recognize theirs. We invite the world to visit and do business with Palau, accepting our laws and respecting our traditions, and we pledge to treat our visitors fairly as we welcome them to our productive and growing country.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa08">Palau's journey to this point has not always been easy. Through rough waters and turbulent weather Palau has steadily sailed towards sovereignty and self-determination. We have been steered by the guiding rudder of our unique cultural values and propelled by the strong winds of progressive democratic principles. I am extremely pleased that, this morning, Palau has brought to the United Nations representatives of our traditional and elected leadership.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa09">Palau's young constitutional democracy is now stronger and more stable than ever before. We are unified in our desire to build our country, to provide for the education and health of our people and to maintain our balanced national budget while reducing government and encouraging the private sector. We in Palau must now focus on building economic self-sufficiency, which is an essential component of true sovereignty. Our funding is limited and must be used and invested wisely to meet our nation's long-term goals.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa10">Our natural resources are our best foundation for developing a strong economy. Our rock islands are unique and beautiful. Our seas are pristine and maritime resources abundant. Palau has been rated one of the seven underwater wonders of the world and one of the most desirable diving locations in the world. Therefore, in our Declaration of Independence, signed on l October 1994, we pledged to preserve our marine environment as a living treasure, not just for ourselves and our future generations, but for the entire planet and, in return, we know that Palau is not travelling alone in its effort to develop a truly long-lasting and sustainable economy. We now are a Member of the United Nations and can act together with our fellow brothers and sisters in the international family of nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa11">The lessons we have learned from our history are the importance of our people and of our cultural traditions, the need to resolve conflicts peacefully and the fact that we must work together to sustain our planet for future generations. These ideas are, of course, central to the Charter of the United Nations. We hope that we can contribute to international cooperation and communication among all nations, working to enhance the lives of our people today and tomorrow so that they may live together in peace and without the scourge of war.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa12">I and the other representatives of my country believed it was important to be here today so that, before this Assembly, we could reaffirm the declaration we made in our application for membership in the United Nations. We declare our acceptance of the obligations set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and our commitment to fulfil them.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg005-bk05-pa13">In coming to Palau, our ancestors sailed bravely into the unknown. They needed courage, skill and cooperation simply to survive. Now, we too will also need these same qualities as we voyage forward into an unknown future. With the determination of our ancestors as an example, with unity as a people, and with faith in Almighty Providence, I know that we will create a great island nation for future generations of Palauans and an energetic member of the community of nations.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Dione</span><span class="nation">Guinea</span><span class="language">French</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa01">I have the honour and privilege to address the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session on behalf of the Group of African States on this notable draft resolution on the subject of cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa02">Since the agreement of 15 November 1965 that launched cooperation between the two organizations, the questions of mutual interest that they have addressed have included many political, economic, social and cultural problems of fundamental importance for Africa's accelerated sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa03">Agreements on cooperation that have flowed from various resolutions of the General Assembly have in large part had a considerable positive impact on the development process in Africa. This is clearly reflected in the development activities carried out in the five subregions of Africa by specialized agencies and other bodies of the United Nations system, including the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and the World Health Organization, to name but a few of those playing an important catalytic role in the promotion of African development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa04">It gives me genuine pleasure also to reaffirm that cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was central in bringing about the recent downfall of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic system in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa05">Yet, in the present circumstances, it is no secret that the development level of most African countries is low, and that the continent continues to have the largest number of least-developed countries. The poor overall economic performance of the majority of African countries is exacerbated by their grave impairment in terms of political development. Political tension continues to dominate many African countries; when poorly handled, these situations often lead to large-scale conflicts.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa06">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.43</a> is based on the firm hypothesis that agreements on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity are very important to promote the continent's economic growth and development. The text has the usual preambular and operative parts.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa07">The preambular part consists of 13 paragraphs which, <i>inter alia</i>, recall the legal basis of the draft resolution and past efforts on the international, regional and national level to solve Africa's development problems. The preambular part also highlights Africa's fundamental political and economic-development problems.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa08">The operative part contains 25 paragraphs dealing, <i>inter alia</i>, with political and economic questions where cooperation with the United Nations is of particular importance. Among the main points of the operative part are those relating to, first, United Nations assistance to the Organization of African Unity to strengthen its conflict resolution capacity, in particular in the areas of establishment of an early warning system, the creation of machinery for preventive diplomacy, the training of African peace-keepers, logistical and financial support for OAU peace-keeping operations, and the establishment of logistical centres in Africa; secondly, United Nations support for the functioning of the African Economic Community and other African economic groups, to the extent that the strategies of those groups supplement national strategies for the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development; thirdly, coordination of the regional programmes of United Nations agencies in order to create interlinkages among them while ensuring the harmonization of their programmes with those of the African regional and subregional economic organizations; fourthly, the adoption by the United Nations of appropriate measures to ensure the speedy implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, in particular in the areas of resource flows, debt relief and diversification of African economies; and, fifthly, the framework agreement by the United Nations on the necessary and appropriate economic, financial and technical assistance to refugees and displaced persons as well as to African countries of asylum.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg007-bk11-pa09">Let me conclude by stressing that African countries continue to pin great hopes on the ability of the United Nations, through these agreements on cooperation, to transform despair into optimism in Africa, to free our countries from the yoke of underdevelopment, and to transform poverty into wealth. But all of this depends on the diligence with which the draft resolution is implemented.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Abdellah</span><span class="nation">Tunisia</span><span class="language">French</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak today on behalf of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa02">Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity is of crucial importance for the promotion of both regional and international peace and development. Since its establishment, the pan-African organization has benefitted greatly from cooperation with the United Nations, especially in the areas of decolonization, the struggle against apartheid, security and economic and social development. Today more than ever Africa needs this cooperation to be further strengthened and calls for greater interest on the part of the entire international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa03">Following the Tunis summit, African Foreign Ministers met in New York on 29 September 1994. They stressed the need for sustained efforts, especially within the United Nations system, to support the activities of African countries to overcome their difficulties.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa04">The conflicts that assail several regions of Africa are a major challenge and a grave concern for us all. African Heads of State or Government are convinced that constructive dialogue in the framework of preventive diplomacy can help defuse crises before they break out and are determined to shoulder their responsibilities for the maintenance of peace on the continent; hence, they have decided to establish a mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa. Since it began to function, this mechanism has interceded on a number of occasions and has proved to be most useful for the maintenance of peace in our continent. But experience has shown that effective support from the international community will be necessary to make that mechanism more effective and to enable it fully to attain its objectives.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa05">In this regard, cooperation between the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations would be particularly valuable. Here, we welcome the fruitful collaboration between the two organizations with a view to preserving security and stability in Burundi and Rwanda. The efforts of both to bring the situation in these two countries back to normal deserve to be continued and supported.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa06">In this context, the refugee problem continues to be a source of instability in the region, necessitating more concerted action to find a lasting solution. In this connection, we believe that it is essential to continue to encourage national reconciliation in both countries and to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa07">We hope that the regional conference on assistance for refugees in the Great Lakes region will take place as soon as possible. This conference should facilitate the preparation of a strategy for international cooperation and a plan of action to deal with the problem of refugees in the region.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa08">Elsewhere, we should like to salute the efforts of the OAU and the United Nations that led to the peace processes in Mozambique and in Angola.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa09">Furthermore, we take this opportunity to draw attention to the need to strengthen cooperation between the OAU and the United Nations with a view to settling the conflicts in Somalia and Liberia. The difficulties being encountered by these two countries are hindering progress towards peace. Therefore, there is a need for increased efforts. I refer not only to diplomatic efforts to bring the parties to the conflict together in the interests of securing a peaceful solution but also to the need for greater financial and logistical assistance. Such assistance is essential if the African forces of the Military Observer Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOMOG), together with the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, are to continue their mission for the maintenance of peace in Liberia.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa10">Economic and social development is also an area in which cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU is fundamental to helping the African continent meet the challenges it is confronting in this respect. Poverty, debt, desertification, the very limited diversification in commodities, unemployment, refugees and obstacles to sustainable development are equally difficulties that require close cooperation between the two organizations. Here, United Nations action should be aimed at giving priority to Africa's concerns, at giving momentum to the role of the international community and at coordinating the activities of various international bodies and organizations in this field.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa11">Forthcoming international meetings -- in particular, the World Conference for Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen, and the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held in Beijing -- will be promising opportunities to promote further cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU in these areas and, thereby, complement and deepen the coordination between the two organizations in the implementation of the strategies, plans of action and principles adopted at the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, at the Rio Summit and at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa12">Thus far, the effective implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s has come up against difficulties. Notwithstanding proposals and initiatives in this regard -- especially with respect to the creation of a fund for the purpose of diversifying commodities and resolving the debt problem -- the results recorded to date fall far short of our expectations. Today, it is essential that we combine our efforts and alert the international community to the urgent need for effective implementation of the United Nations Programme for the Development of Africa and for promotion of the support it requires.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa13">Under this heading, as the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Africa emphasized at their most recent meeting, held in New York, better coordination between the Bretton Woods institutions and those of the United Nations, in full association with the OAU, would be extremely beneficial in promoting the programme for Africa's development. Besides, these same Ministers said that it is imperative that a high-level department, in addition to the existing coordination mechanism for Africa, be established to ensure the underpinning and implementation of programmes that meet the concerns of Africa in the area of development and programmes such as those presented in the New Agenda.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa14">Furthermore, and taking into account the new international economic problems facing Africa, economic integration within the framework of the African Economic Community and the strengthening of the commercial capacity of each country are prerequisites for assured sustainable development. In this regard, the United Nations and the specialized agencies must redouble their efforts to facilitate complementarity between the economies of African countries and to allow for the growth and diversification of their exports through specific programmes of technical assistance and steps to maintain awareness of the need to mobilizing financial resources to this end.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa15">In the same perspective, we should like to reiterate the proposal made by President Ben Ali, the current Chairman of the OAU, who advocated</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa16">"the preparation of a global economic and social plan whose goal would be to safeguard Africa's development on a sound and lasting basis and to help our continent make up for its deficiencies, become integrated in the world economy and ensure the conditions necessary to enable all the people of the continent to lead a dignified life."</blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa17">This plan, which requires close cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU, should have as its objective the strengthening of Africa's own capacities through the mobilization of financial resources, the intensification of technical assistance and the consolidation of industrialization, to be achieved through partnership, direct investment, trade and research with a view to finding a solution to the problem of debt.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg008-bk01-pa18">I should like, in conclusion, to pay tribute to the United Nations Secretary-General for the work he is doing to strengthen cooperation in all areas between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. We hope that Africa will enjoy the effective support of everyone that it truly deserves.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Kamunanwire</span><span class="nation">Uganda</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa01">My delegation expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/A-49-490.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/490</a>) on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). We thank all Governments, organizations and Agencies and Programmes of the United Nations system, as well as the financial institutions, for their continued cooperation with the OAU and with individual African countries. We endorse the statement made by the representative of Tunisia, who spoke on behalf of the OAU.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa02">In the face of rapid changes on the international scene and the various challenges confronting Africa, African countries are convinced that solidarity and cooperation with each other, on the one hand, and with the international community, on the other hand, are needed now more than ever before. After the political liberation of the continent, Africa is now resolutely taking up the remaining challenges, including putting an end to the endemic civil wars on the continent, with their attendant effects of influxes of refugees and displaced persons; socio-economic development, for which the realization of an integrated pan-African Economic Community is a commendable first step; and ensuring the democratization of political and economic institutions and respect for human rights. The OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution and the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community provide appropriate frameworks in this regard.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa03">The establishment of and commitment to the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution is indeed a testimony to the seriousness of Africa and its resolve to face the challenges of peace. In all efforts on the ground, cooperation with the United Nations and other peace-loving partners remains crucial. For their part, States Members of the OAU have vowed to contribute all in their power for the successful operationalization and implementation of this Mechanism. Areas in which external assistance will be vital are logistical support and development of the requisite capacity for conflict prevention and resolution, including adequate financial resources for African peace-keepers and their equipment and training and the establishment of an early warning system for preventive diplomacy. Equally important is the need for the United Nations and its appropriate organs to cooperate and consult with the OAU and its Member States on decisions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security in Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa04">Efforts under way in Africa for economic development have a better chance of success if progress is also made in integrating the economies of the region. The need for regional economic integration derives from the realization that the comparatively small size of Africa's economies constitutes a serious handicap to their performance in an increasingly competitive international market. Yet Africa's potentials cannot be underestimated. That is why the entry into force of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community in May this year, complemented by similar regional initiatives, such as the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Maghreb Union, presents a great opportunity not only for Africa but also for our development partners. We therefore call for increased support for the successful implementation of the Treaty so that African economies are well and fairly integrated into the overall world economy, with increased benefits for us all.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa05">Financial flows to Africa have been steadily declining. If Africa is to sustain the momentum of its difficult economic reform processes, this trend should be reversed, and developed countries will need to ensure adequate increases in external financial resources and debt-relief measures for the continent. According to available figures, Africa's declining access to funds stands in contrast to the surge in lending to the developing countries overall. Moreover, Africa's financial trends run contrary to the recommendations of the "United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s" (UN-NADAF), adopted by the Assembly in December 1991. For Africa's growth rates to rise sufficiently to set the continent on a course of economic recovery, the "New Agenda" estimated that the continent would need aid levels significantly higher than those prevailing at the end of the 1980s.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa06">We call on the United Nations to ensure the effective and successful implementation of the UN-NADAF, especially with regard to adequate resource flows, debt-relief measures and the diversification of African economies. In this respect, there should be strengthened coordination in the Secretariat in order to monitor and follow up these efforts. In our view, the establishment of a high-policy-level office specifically to monitor the implementation of UN-NADAF would be appropriate. With regard to the diversification of African economies, we remain convinced of the need for the establishment of a distinctive diversification facility within the African Development Bank with a fund put aside especially for African commodity diversification.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa07">On external debts, allow me to repeat the following statement made by my Foreign Minister during the general debate at this session of the General Assembly:</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg010-bk01-pa08">"For economic reforms to succeed in our countries, all creditors, including multilateral institutions, should adopt enhanced measures that go beyond debt-rescheduling in order to bring about a substantial reduction in our total stock of debt. Such measures should include substantial debt cancellation or conversion into grants and/or other innovative schemes such as the use of reserves, a new issue of special drawing rights and debt swaps. In this regard Uganda endorses the conclusion of the recent Jakarta Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Debt and Development: Sharing of Experiences' and the recent proposal by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer on measures to resolve the debt problem of the poorest countries."

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Sy</span><span class="nation">Senegal</span><span class="language">French</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa01">This is an important date in the annals of our Organization. My delegation wishes to reiterate the congratulations offered by the Chairman of the African Group to the Republic of Palau on its admission as the one hundred and eighty-fifth Member State. We also want to express our determination to cooperate with that country's delegation to the United Nations in the friendliest, most efficient and most loyal way possible.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa02">This historic event happily coincides with our debate on agenda item 32, entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity".</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa03">For almost 30 years, the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity have developed, in an exemplary spirit of political partnership, a fruitful and dynamic cooperation aimed at promoting the creation in Africa of lasting conditions for peace, security and socio-economic development. In that regard, the delegation of Senegal particularly welcomes the important progress achieved towards those objectives.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa04">Certainly, one of the most significant results, particularly given its historical importance, is the return of South Africa to the concert of free and democratic nations. This remarkable event, following upon the elimination of apartheid and warmly greeted by the delegation of Senegal at that time, is surely the result of unwavering international solidarity; but it is also the culmination of common efforts made over decades by the two organizations to that end.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa05">The national reconciliation recently achieved in Mozambique, in particular through the mediation of the OAU, as witnessed by the recent elections successfully held in that country under the aegis of the United Nations, as well as the important actions undertaken in Somalia, Angola, Liberia, Burundi and Rwanda in attempts to restore peace and security, can also be attributed to that cooperation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa06">Given these positive and encouraging facts, the cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU deserves to be intensified and broadened. It must put greater emphasis on the socio-economic field, in which Africa is currently facing serious challenges. From this perspective, the delegation of Senegal is pleased to note that, in his report on this subject in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-490.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/490</a>, the Secretary-General offers increased opportunity for this cooperation by devoting greater attention to such priority fields as the economy, social and humanitarian issues and the environment. I hope that this approach will lead to concrete and important measures.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa07">This wish is all the more justified by Africa's economic situation, which is beset by the increasing pauperization of certain social strata, a dearth of capital, serious indebtedness accompanied by a progressive decline in official development assistance, and a grave threat of famine or malnutrition to some 34 million inhabitants.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa08">The Agenda for Peace, the OAU's mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa, the Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community, the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and the Programme of Action of the recent International Conference on Population and Development -- all are invaluable instruments which the United Nations and the OAU can apply to the further strengthening of their cooperation. Furthermore, we hope that the conclusions and recommendations anticipated from the world summits on women and social development will consolidate and widen this framework of cooperation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa09">The Agenda for Peace and the OAU mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa offer an opportunity to encourage not only the decentralization of peace-keeping operations but also a greater involvement of the countries concerned in the process of settling conflict situations in their region in conformity with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa10">To the advantages of rationalizing the rather limited financial means available to these two organizations, we should add the improved management of local political, social and cultural requirements, which often seem to be limiting factors on the efficiency of peace-keeping operations. The United Nations therefore has every reason to offer technical and financial assistance to the mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa in order to make it more operational and effective. The interdependence between peace and development, now firmly established and acknowledged, has come to show that energetic action to promote the development of Africa is the best way to address the true causes of political and armed conflicts in the region.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa11">Support for efforts to integrate the African economies and to implement Agenda 21 and the United Nations New Agenda, including a solution to the debt crisis, the relaunching of economic growth and the creation of a diversification fund for African commodities are all highly important potential directions for cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU. All these factors clearly demonstrate that this cooperation must go beyond its traditional theoretical framework and move resolutely towards the conception and implementation of concrete actions on behalf of Africa. In this way the United Nations can adequately fulfil its duty to create conditions for the emergence of a world of peace, security and prosperity for all, including for us Africans.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa12">As the United Nations medium-term programme for 1992-1997 has determined Africa's economic recovery to be among the five identified global priorities, we must now translate these generous intentions into deeds through concrete action, particularly by the mobilization of additional and adequate resources.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg011-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, the delegation of Senegal hopes that the draft resolution before us will be adopted without a vote and that, in time, its implementation will enjoy the unanimous support of the international community. We fully support the relevant statements made this morning by the representatives of Tunisia and Guinea, speaking on behalf of the Current Chairman of the OAU and the African Group of States, respectively.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Msengezi</span><span class="nation">Zimbabwe</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa01">Let me thank the Secretary-General for his report on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-490.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/490</a>. My delegation fully associates itself with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Tunisia on behalf of the Organization of African Unity on this subject.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa02">Cooperation between the two organizations -- the United Nations and the OAU -- has increased vastly since it started nearly 30 years ago in 1965. We welcome the United Nations solid working relationship with the OAU in such areas as the decolonization of the African continent, the eradication of racial discrimination, racism and apartheid, assistance to refugees and the promotion of regional and subregional economic cooperation and integration among African countries. Indeed, all of the operational funds and programmes of the United Nations are undertaking valuable activities at the national and regional levels on the African continent.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa03">Just a few weeks ago, this Assembly held an important debate on strengthening the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations. Let me commend the Department of Humanitarian Affairs for coordinating rapid responses to the various sudden natural and man-made disasters in various parts of the African continent. We also appreciate the role the Department played in the preparation of the African Common Position for the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, which was held in Yokohama, Japan, in May this year.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa04">Zimbabwe is on record as having welcomed the proposal made by the Secretary-General in his report "An Agenda for Peace" relating to cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in resolving conflicts, in peacemaking and in peace-building. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe, Mr. Nathan Shamuyarira, stated during the general debate in this Assembly on 11 October 1994,</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa05">"efforts to promote peace, stability and security ... can largely be facilitated through regional organizations and good neighbours". (<i>Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 27th meeting, p. 8</i>).</blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa06">To this end, in June 1993 Africa resolved to create a permanent mechanism of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. Consequently, the OAU has been actively engaged in efforts to resolve the conflicts in Angola, Mozambique, Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and Liberia. Indeed, it was in keeping with its commitment to regional arrangements that southern Africa took the initiative to resolve the constitutional crisis in Lesotho earlier this year. We count on the continued support of the United Nations, particularly in financial, logistical and material terms, to ensure that these regional arrangements are strengthened and sustainable. We welcome the interest in assisting the OAU in this endeavour shown so far by some Member States. It is our hope that these initiatives will be coordinated through the central organ of the OAU mechanism.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa07">We recognize that regional arrangements should go beyond issues of peace and security alone. In this respect, Africa has committed itself to strategies designed to accelerate regional economic integration. Through regional economic integration organizations such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Arab Maghreb Union, Africa is laying a foundation for its ultimate objective, namely, an African Economic Community. It is our hope that these efforts will continue to enjoy the tangible support of the international community and the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa08">Only yesterday this Assembly held a very important debate on the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Zimbabwe remains convinced that the New Agenda provides the framework through which the United Nations system can support the efforts made by the African continent to make economic and social progress in the years ahead. We believe that the various bodies and organs of the United Nations, including operational funds and programmes, specialized agencies, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and other parts of the United Nations system, should cooperate closely with the Organization of African Unity in working towards the objectives of the New Agenda. We believe that if we are to achieve those objectives, the efforts of African countries need to be complemented substantially by the international community through, <i>inter alia</i>, increased official development assistance, direct foreign investment, a comprehensive solution to the continent's crushing debt burden, better commodity prices and improved market access. We believe that the question of the diversification of African economies, the need for which the United Nations has clearly recognized, will be given substantive treatment during this session of the General Assembly, particularly through an early agreement on the establishment of a diversification facility for Africa's commodities.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa09">We have pointed out repeatedly in this Assembly that the United Nations has over the years adopted many international instruments on the question of development. Apart from the New Agenda for Africa which I have just referred to, we have such important instruments, as the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, the Declaration of the eighteenth special session, Agenda 21 and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, recently adopted in Cairo. We believe that it is the central task of the United Nations to galvanize international support for the objectives of these important instruments, particularly towards the eradication of poverty, creation of employment and the promotion of social integration. In this context, we continue to hope that the World Summit for Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen in March 1995, will take fully into account Africa's particular needs.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg012-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity should underscore the resolve of the African countries and the rest of the international community to rise above present obstacles and launch the continent on the path of economic recovery and development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Mongbe</span><span class="nation">Benin</span><span class="language">French</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa01">Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the subject of agenda item 32, should be easy enough to understand in the context of Chapter VIII of the Charter of this universal organization.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa02">For that reason, many African delegations, including the delegation of Benin, had felt that the presentation of the item at a single meeting by the Chairman of the Group of African States and the current Chairman of the OAU, with supporting technical explanations by the Executive Secretary of the OAU's Mission at the United Nations, would suffice to obtain the consensus needed for the adoption of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.43</a>. But the long-standing reluctance of some delegations requires the delegation of Benin, which had the honour to take part in the unofficial consultations on this draft resolution, to make this statement.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa03">Since 15 November 1965 there has been an agreement on cooperation between the OAU and the United Nations. This agreement was updated on 9 October 1990 by the Secretaries-General of the two organizations as a response to rapid developments both in Africa and at the international level.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa04">Since 1988 resolutions have been adopted regularly by our Assembly -- seven, to be precise -- confirming the need for cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU. During the OAU Conference in Tunis from 6 to 11 June 1994, African Heads of State and Government, in recognition of the pivotal role now played by the United Nations on the international stage with the end of the cold war, reaffirmed their faith in this cooperation. They are fully convinced that new opportunities will open up for the United Nations to reach its fundamental objectives: the maintenance of international peace and security, the promotion of social progress with "better standards of life in larger freedom", the promotion of and respect for human rights.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa05">It is in this spirit that each year the acting President of the Pan-African Organization or his representative has come to address the General Assembly. This year again, more specifically on 3 October, the Foreign Minister of Tunisia, representing the acting President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), presented to the international community a description of the political, economic and social developments in Africa, taking care in so doing to call on the United Nations system to maintain and strengthen its cooperation with Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa06">Apartheid, which has been one of the most stubborn and hardy perennials on the agenda of the General Assembly, appearing year after year, is something that need hold our attention no longer. Indeed, efforts to eliminate this scourge have been crowned with success, with the emergence of a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa. Cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU has been of great assistance in bringing about this happy outcome.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa07">The cold war is over, and the world is rejoicing and celebrating its end, which is marked by the breakup of ideologies and the perceptible reduction in the number of sterile debates. Nevertheless, there continue to exist sources of tension throughout the world and, in particular, in Africa. Noteworthy examples are the human tragedy being played out before the eyes of the world in Somalia, which, unfortunately, appears to be tiring or irritating world public opinion; the Rwandese tragedy, which took on such an inhuman aspect a few months ago; the fratricidal conflict in Liberia, where respect for cease-fire agreements and for reconciliation have been short-lived.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa08">The persistence of conflicts of this kind is a serious obstacle to the economic recovery of the countries of the African continent, besides which it gives rise to displaced populations in search of supposed havens of peace and adequate food. That is why the Heads of State and Government of the OAU, at their Dakar Conference in July 1992, decided to create a mechanism for the prevention, management and settlement of conflicts throughout the continent.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa09">That machinery was established in June 1993 at the Cairo Summit. It constitutes a source of hope for the safeguarding of peace throughout the continent, but given the meagre means available to African countries, support from the United Nations and its Member States is needed to strengthen the capacity of that machinery. The OAU needs assistance, for example, in the following fields: the creation of an early-warning system; the establishment of machinery for preventive diplomacy; the training of African personnel and contingents for peace-keeping operations; and logistical and financial support for those operations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa10">Even before the establishment of such machinery, the Heads of State and Government reaffirmed their full support for the peace efforts being made by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to restore peace to Liberia, and they strengthened the diplomatic means of the Pan-African Organization to bring about an acceptable outcome for the tragedy of Somalia. It is, then, not for lack of trying that they have not yet been able to put an end to these irrational situations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa11">My delegation once again expresses its appreciation to the Security Council and to each of its members for the efforts they have been making to deal with the problems of Somalia, Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Rwanda and, of course, Western Sahara.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa12">The unique capacity of the Security Council has been brought to bear in the following ways: in creating conditions for the conclusion of peace agreements and the settlement of the Angolan conflict; in leading the people of Mozambique to free and democratic elections under international control; in strengthening the measures it had decided upon to ensure the delivery of food assistance in Somalia; and in imposing an embargo on arms and military <i>matériel </i>in the Liberian conflict. All these are acts that enhance the good name and image of the United Nations in Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa13">For about five years, qualitative changes have been taking place on the African political scene. The thirst for freedom and the ardent desire of the African people fully to enjoy their fundamental rights have led to great upheavals marked by the clash of political cultures on the path to democratization. Thus it has been that several countries of the continent have committed themselves to the process of democratization, aimed at promoting the effective participation of all segments of the population in the development process and the management of public affairs.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa14">In most cases, this process has encountered -- indeed, is still encountering -- setbacks, which have led to disorders and delays in economic and social advancement. My delegation therefore believes that increased assistance from the United Nations should be given to countries requesting it in order to increase the chances of success for the democratization process in those countries, and in order to organize pluralistic, free and fair elections.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa15">One of those areas in which cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU is most urgent and indeed indispensable is cooperation for the recovery and economic development of Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa16">The General Assembly, at its forty-eighth session, stressed the urgent need to intensify international cooperation in order to bring about a lasting solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries, which dangerously jeopardizes their development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa17">As regards the particular case of Africa, the measures envisaged in the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s must be implemented by the international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa18">My delegation, like the other African delegations, is very much concerned at the fact that three years after its adoption, the New Agenda would still appear to be at the stage of taking its first few hesitant steps. It looks very much as if it will encounter the same failure as did its predecessor, the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, as was stated yesterday. We hope that concrete measures will be taken adequately to inform the various partners in Africa's progress that they must contribute, without reserve, to the implementation of General Assembly decisions regarding the implementation of the New Agenda. To that end, invitations to take part in this endeavour must also be extended to Governments, the organs, the Programmes and the Funds of the United Nations and to intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to make the contributions expected of them. The Tokyo Conference on Africa's economic problems, which was held in 1993, is very much part of this effort and should be viewed as an action to mobilize resources, thus permitting the Government of Japan to orient its assistance to the priorities that have been identified in the New Agenda.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa19">My delegation particularly supports the idea that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should invite the representative of the Secretary-General of the OAU to participate in the meetings of all bodies, commissions, committees and working groups of the United Nations dealing with the follow-up, control and evaluation of the New Agenda.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa20">In this connection, we would express the hope that the arrangement responsible for following up the New Agenda in the Secretariat of the United Nations -- the Office of the Special Commissioner for Africa and the Least Developed Countries (OSCAL) -- should be strengthened in terms of human, financial and material resources if it is to carry out more effectively the task entrusted to it.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa21">It should be recalled that one of the concerns of the Heads of State and Government of Africa is to strengthen cooperation between the OAU and the United Nations within the framework of the creation of the African Economic Community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa22">They invite international organizations, financing agencies, other institutions within the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations to support economic cooperation and integration programmes that come within the framework of the priorities set out by the subregional economic communities.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa23">The delegation of Benin welcomes the financial contribution made by the United Nations Development Programme to the Organization of African Unity for the creation of the machinery set forth in the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa24">We support the idea set forth in the draft resolution under consideration to call on the relevant organs of the United Nations to ensure</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa25">&quot;the effective, fair and equitable representation of Africa&quot; <i>(<a href="../pdf/A-49-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.43</a>, para. 23)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa26">at various levels within the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa27">At the end of the twentieth century and on the threshold of the third millennium, Africa remains a continent which is, at best, not very well known and, at worst, unknown and even ignored. My delegation would therefore highlight operative paragraph 21 of the draft resolution before us and would like to reiterate, in different terms, what we stated in the Fourth and Fifth Committees of the General Assembly: international public opinion must be alerted to the situation in Africa, in terms of both political progress and of economic and social problems.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg014-bk01-pa28">In conclusion, may I express the hope that a proper understanding of our situation by all delegations in our Assembly will take the form of the adoption by consensus of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.43</a>, which sums up the aspirations of the peoples of Africa and expresses the wishes of their leaders.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Eteffa</span><span class="nation">Ethiopia</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa01">As one of the founding States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the permanent seat of its headquarters, Ethiopia is pleased to participate in the deliberations of the General Assembly on the important issue of cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. In this regard, we would like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his informative and valuable report, and pledge our strong support for his endeavours to further enhance the cooperation of the two organizations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa02">The report (<a href="../pdf/A-49-490.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/490</a>) before us demonstrates that the areas of cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU have been further expanded and strengthened over the past years. We note that the OAU and the various technical and development agencies of the United Nations have increased their close contacts and consultations. Since both the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa are located in Addis Ababa, the two organizations have been working hand in hand.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa03">These positive developments not only testify to the commitment of the two organizations to work together but also show concretely their desire to expand their fields of cooperation and strengthen the existing ones. We welcome this constructive spirit, and we believe that there is great potential for further strengthened cooperation between the two organizations within the framework of their charters. Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations makes the cooperation that should exist between the United Nations and regional organizations very clear. For the United Nations, decentralizing some of its activities in coordination with regional organizations could be more effective and less costly. In this respect, we welcome the adoption of the Declaration on the Enhancement of Cooperation between the United Nations and Regional Arrangements or Agencies in the Maintenance of International Peace and Security.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa04">The exchange of experience and information in technical and development areas and the provision of financial assistance to various projects are the major aspects of cooperation that need to be further strengthened. The promotion of economic, social and cultural rights must be addressed within the framework of such cooperation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa05">With the end of the cold war, novel regional approaches to prevent disputes from escalating into conflicts have been devised and set in motion. With regard to our region, it was in June 1991 that the Organization of African Unity established a new mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, with a view to addressing issues concerning peace, stability and security on the continent. Conflict resolution is one of the top priorities in Africa and should receive the full assistance of the international community. The mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa should be staffed by competent, committed and visionary individuals for the successful accomplishment of its enormous task.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa06">We believe that this initiative is not only an important step in the right direction, but also supplements the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of global peace and security by way of contributing to the reduction of its overextended peace-keeping operations. Although significant steps have been taken by the OAU in the area of peacemaking and peace-keeping during the past years, conflicts have persisted in many parts of our region. The resolution of conflicts in Africa has been slow, partly because the challenges that the organization is facing are far greater than the means and resources available to it to respond urgently and effectively. We would therefore call upon the United Nations to provide assistance to the OAU to further strengthen its peacemaking, peace-keeping and humanitarian intervention capabilities.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa07">While the process of peacemaking, reconciliation and peace-keeping operations should have genuine global characteristics, the countries of the region could make positive contributions by responding in a timely and cost-effective manner, given the necessary resources, strict coordination, proper orientation, training and commitment.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa08">Conflict prevention, management and resolution involves a subtle and delicate handling of the issues and parties concerned. Negotiations to reach a political settlement and reconciliation as well as other efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully require, among other things, a knowledge of the historical background of the conflicts, the cultural and linguistic sensibilities of the people, their relationships with neighbouring peoples and States and the whole social, cultural and economic context of the situation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa09">The active support and involvement of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, which, in relative terms, possess the much-needed resources and experience in such vital areas of environment, population and socio-economic development will be crucial for Africa. In this respect, particular emphasis must be placed on strengthening the OAU's capabilities to create a solid foundation for the region's economic growth and sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa10">Africa's efforts to moderate its rapid population growth, the implementation of the Tunis declaration and resolution on population and development and the preparation of the Treaty and protocols for the establishment of the African Economic Community and for its ultimate realization require the active and unreserved support of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa11">Africa is also a priority region for environmental and socio-economic assistance, particularly in such areas as the reduction of drought and desertification, maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, the eradication of illiteracy, the repatriation of refugees and humanitarian activities to help famine victims, returnees and internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa12">Since democratization is also important for the achievement of peace and stability, as well as for social and economic progress, we urge the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity to work together in support of the ongoing democratization processes in Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa13">I should like to reiterate once again Ethiopia's conviction that the activities of the United Nations and those of the Organization of African Unity in the fields of peacemaking, peace-keeping and development are mutually reinforcing and complementary. Therefore, enhanced cooperation on the basis of effective partnership in the maintenance of global peace and security, as well as in human-centred sustainable growth and development, is important.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa14">Unless we critically examine the functions of the United Nations, there can hardly be improvements. If we care -- as we do -- we should look critically at the activities and actions of the Organization. There is no doubt that it could be more effective and more economical and, thereby, make a greater impact. A positive impact is what the international community is looking for. The existing discrepancy between actions and paper-oriented activities is a matter of concern to my delegation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa15">The activities category includes declarations, resolutions, decisions, papers and non-papers. Unless these activities are followed by concrete actions their impact on the lives of people will be questionable. In the category of actions are the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance, effective peace-keeping operations and peacemaking and peace-building efforts, as well as undertakings aimed at contributing to socio-economic progress and poverty alleviation. It seems to be common knowledge that, so far, paper-oriented activities have had a greater share -- an unduly large share -- in the work of the United Nations. In future, the scales should tilt in favour of actions. Action-oriented cooperation should go beyond piles and piles of documents -- the heaps of paper that have negative implications for the environment rather than practical significance.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg016-bk01-pa16">This is why my delegation is calling for cooperation and partnership characterized by actions that will make a positive and durable impact on the lives of ordinary men and women in Africa. It is in this spirit that Ethiopia is one of the sponsors of the draft resolution before the Assembly. We hope that it will be adopted unanimously.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Rudolph</span><span class="nation">Germany</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union, and Austria supports this statement.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa02">In the year that has passed since we last debated this issue in the United Nations General Assembly there has been a growing awareness of the crucial role that regional organizations can play in meeting the huge economic, ecological, social and security challenges that we face today. Being physically closer to the problems at hand, regional organizations have in the recent past shown their ability to obtain easier access, to recognize the needs faster and to display greater flexibility than can those parts of the international community that have not been directly affected. This is the very concept behind Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) is a case in point, as it has amply demonstrated with its recent commitments.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa03">Africa, as a neighbouring continent, is of special importance and interest to us. At the same time, we are well aware of the concern of African leaders that their continent might be marginalized. I should like to take this opportunity to emphasize once more that this will not happen. The European Union has on several occasions been made aware that developments, both positive and negative, that take place in Africa are of direct relevance to our own countries. None of us can master on his own the global tasks confronting us.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa04">The European Union is therefore ready to encourage regional cooperation and integration in Africa and to strengthen its ties with the OAU and the subregional organizations of the continent, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD). The ministerial conference between the European Union and SADC that took place in Berlin this September represents an important step forward in the development of such links.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa05">In the past year we have seen many important developments on the African continent -- some of them very positive; others tragic and disturbing.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa06">With the holding of democratic elections in South Africa and the formation of a new Government under the leadership of President Nelson Mandela, one of the great aims of the OAU and of all of us in the United Nations family has been achieved: the abolition of apartheid and the rise of a truly democratic society in South Africa. It is our strong hope that the new South Africa will act as an example of reconciliation between former adversaries and as a force for stability and economic development in the region.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa07">The European Union notes with satisfaction that, following the first multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections in Mozambique, which took place from 27 to 29 October 1994, President Chissano was inaugurated on 9 December. The elections, for which the European Union contributed 200 observers, can be called a success. In this respect, we should like to commend the role of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique -- in particular, that of the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative in Maputo, Mr. Aldo Ajello -- in the Mozambican peace process.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa08">On 20 November the Angolan Government and UNITA signed a peace Agreement in Lusaka. The European Union welcomes this important step towards lasting peace in Angola. The European Union notes with satisfaction that the Security Council welcomed the United Nations Secretary-General's decision to proceed with restoration of the strength of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission -- the actual enlargement being dependent on an effective cease-fire. We urge Angola's parties to respect the Lusaka Protocol and to abide fully by the terms of the cease-fire. The European Union is prepared to cooperate closely with the Angolan Government in the reconstruction of the country's economy after 19 years of devastating civil war.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa09">We recall our support for the settlement plan for the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, organized by the United Nations in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity (OAU). We renew our appeal to both parties to cooperate fully with the Secretary-General and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa10">The recent genocide in Rwanda claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Even after the installation of a new Government in Kigali, the neighbouring countries and the international community continue to bear the burden of 2 million refugees. In this respect, we are concerned about the deteriorating situation in the refugee camps in the neighbouring countries. We hope that further steps will be taken as a matter of urgency to address this problem.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa11">The rehabilitation and reconstruction of that devastated country, as well as the return and reintegration of millions of refugees and internally displaced persons, are enormous tasks that require great efforts and close cooperation between the international community, regional bodies, the neighbouring countries and the people of Rwanda. The same goes for the long process of lasting reconciliation and for the need of bringing to trial those responsible for the horrendous massacres. In this respect, we welcome the recent establishment of an International Tribunal for Rwanda by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa12">The European Union continues to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced persons and refugees inside and outside Rwanda, is ready to provide rehabilitation assistance and is prepared to resume, under certain conditions, its structural development assistance to Rwanda. In that framework, the European Union Council of Ministers recommended on 25 November an immediate rehabilitation action programme, worth 67 million European currency units, for social structures and other productive structures in Rwanda. In addition, the European Union is supporting the deployment of human rights observers to the area through contributions in the form of financial support, material and personnel.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa13">The European Union applauds the cooperation between most of the parties in Burundi, where the election of a new President and the formation of a new Government constitute important steps towards a democratic solution to the grave crisis which began a year ago. We commend the positive role the OAU and the United Nations Special Representative have played in this development as an encouraging demonstration of the capabilities of those two organizations in the field of preventive diplomacy. Nevertheless, there continue to be many violations of human rights in Burundi, and the situation remains fragile.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa14">In the case of Somalia, unfortunately, the work undertaken by both the United Nations and the OAU has not yet led to any progress towards national reconciliation. All efforts to convene a national reconciliation conference with the participation of all warring factions have so far failed. The factions, through their lack of cooperation with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and with the United Nations, must bear full responsibility for this failure. Under these circumstances, the Security Council has seen no justification for extending the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) beyond the date originally envisaged for the end of the Mission, the end of March 1995. The European Union hopes, however, that both the United Nations and the OAU will continue to assist the people of Somalia in their search for a viable and acceptable peace and calls upon the warring factions to abide fully by their earlier commitments in this respect.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa15">In Liberia, similarly, the peace-keeping and mediation efforts by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations, which we commend, have not yet brought about an end to the fighting. The European Union encourages ECOWAS and the United Nations to continue their efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to this conflict.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa16">The vast majority of the troop contributors to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) are African countries, and the ECOWAS Military Observer Group (ECOMOG) in Liberia is an African initiative. These missions demonstrate that African countries have the political will to bear their share of the conflict-solving and peace-keeping burden on their continent. The difficulties both missions have encountered also make it clear, however, that the problems posed by the lack of resources available to most African troop contributors remain to be solved.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa17">What is needed is a broad-based concept for conflict resolution and peace-keeping that takes into account the particular strengths and weaknesses of the various countries and institutions involved. An institutional framework for this task could include an early warning mechanism, a system of effective mediation in the early stages before the outbreak of a conflict and logistical preparations for a speedy response if an armed conflict arises. This could include improved training for peace-keeping forces and assistance to enable their rapid deployment. The European Union recognizes the urgency of this problem, and several Member States are currently elaborating ideas to this end.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa18">The European Union has followed with great attention the development of the mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution in Africa, created by the OAU. We have witnessed the emergence of a political instrument that has begun to play a significant role and deserves encouragement and support from the international community. In the framework of our growing cooperation, the European Union is currently studying the possibility of further assistance to the OAU in this field.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa19">We are looking forward to intensive discussions with our partners in the OAU on the joint steps we could take in order to be better prepared to respond to crises in the future. A meeting of senior officials representing the European Union and the OAU took place in Brussels on 1 December 1994 in order to work out a framework for closer cooperation. It was decided to institutionalize the dialogue by holding meetings between our two organizations on a regular basis.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa20">Africa continues to face serious economic problems. Insufficient development of the private sector, high population growth and internal conflicts are some of the problems to be addressed in revitalizing growth and sustainable development on the continent. Without sustainable economic growth, the basic needs of Africa's population cannot be met, and prospects for lasting stability in the region will not be very promising.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa21">Our cooperation with Africa is therefore not limited to security questions in the narrow sense of the word. The European Union strongly supports efforts for economic reform in African countries. The traditional cooperation of the European Union with many African countries under the Lomé IV agreement is the cornerstone of our efforts in this respect. This model, which has proved itself valid in the last few decades, links instruments of the trade sphere and the development sphere uniquely and efficiently. As proof of our long-term commitment, Lomé IV has been concluded for a period of 10 years' effectiveness instead of the usual five. Under the National Indicative Programmes, about 4.1 billion European currency units are being disbursed to African countries in the first five years of the agreement. In the area of trade and diversification, substantial financial assistance is given under the system of stabilization of export earnings (STABEX) and the system for stabilizing export earnings in the mining sector (SYSMIN) mechanisms.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa22">The planned mid-term review of the current Lomé agreement began with a conference of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) and European Community Ministers in Swaziland in May this year. Together with our partners in Africa we will try to improve further the effectiveness of our cooperation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa23">In its development policy towards Africa, the European Union will cooperate closely with the United Nations. We strongly support the Secretary-General's initiative of complementing "An Agenda for Peace" with "An Agenda for Development".</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg018-bk01-pa24">I am confident that all our common efforts will help to bring about a better and prosperous future for a continent that has suffered a great deal.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">The President</span><span class="nation"></span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk01-pa01"> In accordance with General Assembly resolution 2011 (XX), of 11 October 1965, I now call on the Observer of the Organization of African Unity.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Sy</span><span class="nation">[Organization of African Unity]</span><span class="language">French</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa01">Allow me first of all to endorse the statement made earlier by the representative of Tunisia speaking as representative of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa02">I should also like to endorse the statement made by the representative of Guinea speaking as Chairman of the Group of African States.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa03">The cooperation between the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, which began some 30 years ago, has grown and flourished over the years and has achieved such notable successes as the liberation of territories under colonial domination and the defeat of the policy of apartheid in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa04">Today, we rejoice to see the first delegation of a free and democratic South Africa seated with us and thus regaining its place in the community of nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa05">In this connection, the OAU and the United Nations have worked in close cooperation, particularly during the preparations for the first democratic election in South Africa. Similarly, we have worked together in preparing for the elections in Mozambique that were the culmination of the peace process in that country. Those successes show the potentials of the cooperation between the OAU and the United Nations and encourage us to deal with renewed strength with the conflicts and wars that are ravaging several regions of the African continent.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa06">Indeed, those conflicts are an important obstacle to the emergence of a political and social environment conducive to economic development and democracy. Without that peaceful environment, cooperation between the United Nations and the OAU -- in spite of all its potentials and its successes in certain areas, particularly agriculture, health, education, the struggle against desertification, child protection and technical assistance -- could very well end up yielding only meagre and short-term results.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa07">Hence, it is imperative that cooperation between our two organizations become a powerful stimulus to the ongoing efforts being made by the Organization of African Unity to promote an environment of peace and economic progress thanks, <i>inter alia</i>, to the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. In this connection, the United Nations and the OAU must work out new methods, approaches and procedures that can enable them together to deal with present conflicts and prevent future ones. That is the challenge inherent in OAU-United Nations cooperation today.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa08">For the conflicts that are now devastating many African countries have already given rise to many serious humanitarian crises, considerably increased the number of refugees and displaced persons, led to massive violations of human rights and posed many threats to international peace and security. Those conflicts, some of which go back to the colonial area, have various origins. Some are only the latest results of the "divide and rule" policies of the former colonial Powers. Others are the results of the cold-war policies of military support for non-democratic Governments and for groups that do not respect human rights. Finally, some conflicts are the outcome of the ill-advised policies pursued by certain Governments and of ethnic rivalries fuelled and aggravated by worsening living conditions and the economic crisis that has been ravaging the continent since the 1980s.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa09">Such conflicts are of major concern to African countries, which are always the first to suffer their effects in the form of massive flows of refugees and increased insecurity. This is also why, whenever a conflict has broken out, African countries have attempted, either with the help of neighbouring countries or with that of the OAU, to contain it and find a peaceful, African, solution to it. Unfortunately, the complex nature of such conflicts and the broad means required to settle them are often beyond the limited resources of African countries. Thus, in Liberia the countries members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), faced with the international community's immobility, agreed to send and have maintained a peace-keeping force there since 1990, notwithstanding the heavy burden such an undertaking places on their economies. The experience of the Military Observer Group of ECOWAS (ECOMOG) thus attests to the will of the African countries to make sacrifices in order to resolve conflicts in their region, just as it illustrates how important it is for the international community to demonstrate its readiness to support the initiatives of African regional and subregional organizations, provide trained personnel and furnish the necessary technical, logistical and financial assistance to facilitate and speed up the success of the operation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa10">Unfortunately, this lesson has only recently begun to be understood. None the less, the international community, responding to the conflicts that have broken out or worsened parallel to the Liberian crisis, has dispatched several peace-keeping forces, which, like the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), have often performed remarkably. The OAU fully appreciates the actions of the international community and hopes that such actions will be taken everywhere, until the goal of peace has been attained, particularly in Liberia, in Somalia, in Angola and in Rwanda. The OAU particularly welcomes the role played by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in getting the message out to the international community and in United Nations initiatives to help settle these conflicts in Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa11">Recently, however, a trend towards disengagement has begun to emerge in the international community, particularly among certain influential members of the Security Council. The result has been that the United Nations has sometimes failed to act in a timely or satisfactory manner, thus leading to a worsening of the conflict and an increase in the number of casualties.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa12">Although the desire to control the spiralling costs of the United Nations conflict-settlement activities is understandable, it should not lead to selective intervention or to the use of a double standard. Not only would such a development prevent the United Nations from properly fulfilling its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security, but it would also and above all undermine the Security Council's credibility, which it has regained with so much difficulty after decades of semi-impotence, and, worse, impugn its moral authority.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa13">One of the principal arguments used to advocate the withdrawal of United Nations forces from certain conflicts is the lack of progress towards national conciliation. This situation is, of course, highly disturbing, particularly for the OAU. It should not, however, lead to such radical solutions as an outright withdrawal of forces but rather to a re-examination of the approach taken and the goals pursued. Such a re-examination would certainly help demonstrate that an earlier intervention giving greater leeway to preventive diplomacy and based more on regional organizations would be less costly and more effective. Similarly, it would show the importance of a better balance between means and ends, of a balanced mandate taking into account the protection of civilians, the delivery of humanitarian aid, the cessation of hostilities and the restoration and consolidation of peace.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa14">Lastly, it could lead to a broader consideration of the potentials inherent in regional organizations, whose cooperative relationship with the United Nations in conflict settlement is still poorly defined.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa15">The present difficulties being encountered by peace-keeping operations, particularly in achieving their goals, and their exorbitant cost are not confined to those operations being carried out in Africa. They are due to the fact that the problems with which they must deal are new and complex and to the presence of protagonists against whom the international community has but limited means of action. Such challenges, which are not insurmountable, should not lead to the suspension of a peace-keeping operation, which could create a situation leading to another serious humanitarian crisis. The Organization of African Unity is deeply concerned by these new trends towards disengagement. Indeed, in June 1933 the OAU, which has made conflict settlement in Africa one of its very highest priorities, established a mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa16">This mechanism, the prime objectives of which are to anticipate and to prevent conflicts, will stress measures to restore and consolidate peace. However, if a conflict requires a peace-keeping operation, the OAU will call on the United Nations, which has greater experience in this area and greater resources. The mechanism is already in effect. Its central organ functions at three levels: that of heads of State and Government, that of foreign ministers and that of ambassadors. A special fund to finance OAU activities in conflict settlement has been established. Lastly, the secretariat of the OAU now has new structures designed to give the central organ the necessary technical support.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa17">The mechanism, which gives form to the determination of African countries to address conflict situations in a resolute manner, has already undertaken several important initiatives in respect of Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia and Somalia. Its action has however been somewhat hampered by its meagre experience and the inadequacy of available resources. In this connection, we note with satisfaction that several donors, both African and non-African, have made significant contributions to the OAU peace fund. These contributions, which are intended to finance specific activities or pay for equipment or <i>matériel </i>for specific operations, will certainly facilitate OAU action in conflict settlement, but we should emphasize that the restrictions attached to some of these contributions -- restrictions which the OAU can appreciate -- do not always lead to the flexibility and speed required by crisis situations. In any case, available resources fall far short of needs. An appeal must be made to the international community to make a generous contribution to the OAU peace fund in order to allow our Organization to respond effectively and swiftly to conflict situations on the continent.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa18">Over the past 12 months, the OAU and the United Nations have cooperated in settling several conflicts in Africa, in particular in South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia and Liberia. In this connection, we welcome the signing of the peace agreement in Angola on 19 November 1994 and the respect of the parties for the cease-fire. After 19 years of war, the courageous people of that country should be able to enjoy real peace.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa19">In Western Sahara, in conformity with the United Nations/OAU settlement plan, our Organization has sent four observers to participate in the work of the Identification Commission to identify voters entitled to participate in the referendum on self-determination. The OAU, as was emphasized by Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, the Secretary-General of our organization, attributes great importance to a peaceful and lasting settlement of the question of Western Sahara through the holding of a free, fair and impartial referendum, in accordance with the settlement plan.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa20">In Liberia, the OAU is participating, in close cooperation with the United Nations and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in efforts to restore peace through the actions of its Eminent Person for Liberia, Dr. Canaan Banana. The OAU has thus been closely associated with efforts leading to the Cotonou Peace Agreement. The Secretary-General of our organization has undertaken a number of actions to facilitate the deployment of additional African contingents to support the Cease-fire Monitoring Group of ECOWAS (ECOMOG).</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa21">Although difficulties remain in the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, consultations are being actively pursued with a view to overcoming them. It is therefore important for the United Nations Mission in Liberia, whose role will be crucial in the implementation of certain provisions of the Peace Agreement, to continue to be present and to support the peace process. It is also essential for the special Trust Fund for Liberia to receive the contributions necessary for the proper continuation of the ECOMOG peace mission.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa22">In Burundi, ever since the crisis erupted in October 1993, the OAU has followed the situation very closely. The central organ of the OAU mechanism for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts decided, at the request of the Burundi authorities, to send a protection and monitoring mission to restore confidence in Burundi, the civilian and military components of which are now in the field. This mission, led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the OAU in close cooperation with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has contributed to stabilizing the situation. The conclusion of the governmental agreement and the election of a new president of the Republic are important steps in the process of national reconciliation. The international community must, however, continue to follow the situation in Burundi very closely, given the regional environment, and to support the authorities of that country in their task of national reconciliation and reconstruction. The OAU, which has decided to hold a regional conference on assistance to refugees early next year, has already begun its preparations in close cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa23">Turning now to the situation in Somalia, it must unfortunately be noted that the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) must withdraw its military contingent in March 1995, despite the fact that the process of national reconciliation has made very little progress and that the country still has no government. In this connection, it should be noted that cooperation between the OAU and the United Nations in that country has not always realized its potential, though it got off to a good start. The United Nations had initiated several joint mediation missions with the OAU, the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference with the aim of achieving a cease-fire in Mogadishu and the success of the conference on national reconciliation held in Addis Ababa in March 1993.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa24">However, with the transfer of the operations of the unified intervention force of UNOSOM II, stress will be laid on establishing conditions of security throughout Somalia, the consequence of which should be a reduction of joint initiatives with regional organizations. Today, as the military contingent of UNOSOM II is preparing to leave, it is perhaps time to return to a process of more consistent consultation and better coordinated action.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa25">Nothing illustrates better the importance of improved coordination between the United Nations and the OAU than the tragedy of Rwanda, particularly from 1990 to 1993, when it was necessary to end the civil war, organize peace negotiations and monitor the cease-fire. The OAU, which sponsored the negotiations, kept the United Nations closely involved in the discussions that were to lead to the Arusha Peace Agreement in August 1993. This coordination facilitated the replacement of the OAU observers by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) when the observers left in October 1993. From November 1993 to April 1994, when the implementation of the Arusha Agreement was deadlocked, the OAU and the United Nations took steps to promote its resumption.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa26">However, following the events of 7 April 1994 and the deterioration of the situation, the Security Council decided to reduce UNAMIR's strength, despite the OAU's objection. This did not help to stabilize the situation. With the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-918(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 918 (1994)</a>, the United Nations was to authorize an increase in UNAMIR's personnel to 5,500 men. Faced with difficulties in obtaining troops and equipment for such a force, the Secretary-General of the OAU engaged in consultations which led, in June 1994, to the commitment of 14 African countries to supplying troops. Unfortunately, the equipment was not available and UNAMIR II was deployed only four months later. In the meantime, about 500,000 people were killed and millions of refugees poured into neighbouring countries, sowing the seeds of further tensions in the subregion.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa27">It is clear from all this that concrete measures must be taken to remedy the obvious shortcomings in OAU/United Nations cooperation in the settlement of conflicts, especially when swift action is required. In this regard, it is important at the outset to acknowledge the United Nations primary responsibility in the maintenance of international peace and security and to recognize that such responsibility cannot be transferred to a regional organization on the pretext that the conflict is taking place in its geographical area. It is desirable, however, in the spirit of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, that the Organization actively seek the cooperation of regional organizations and agree with them on concrete modalities for cooperation and collaboration.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa28">Regional organizations can usefully assist the United Nations in promoting political support from the countries of the region and encouraging them to provide troops for United Nations peace-keeping forces. Similarly, regional organizations, when they have the logistics and the financial resources, could take over from the United Nations. But, for the time being, this is not possible for most of them. The United Nations must therefore study further ways and means of assisting regional organizations and strengthening their conflict prevention and settlement capacities.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa29">It is also important to stress the need to find better procedures for consultations and coordination between the United Nations and the OAU. Consultations should be more systematic and the Security Council must find a way to receive information from the regional organization concerned before it takes any decision.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa30">Turning now to the restoration of peace, the joint missions that have taken place in the past must be renewed whenever conditions are right.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa31">The solution to the conflicts at present ravaging Africa require preventive diplomacy and the restoration and maintenance of peace. However, prevention will require firm action to remedy the underlying economic causes. That is why African countries very early on initiated a process of economic cooperation and integration, the culmination of which was the entry into force, on 12 May 1994, of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community. The Treaty is designed gradually to implement an integrated economic area covering 700 million people and should enable Africa to win its rightful place as a fully fledged partner in the global economy and it deserves the support of the international community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa32">In this regard, the United Nations system should also continue to support the existing subregional communities and their integration programmes, the strengthening of which would mark a first step in the implementation of the African Economic Community. Help must also be provided to implement strategic development and integration plans in the various sectors identified by the Treaty establishing the Community. These programmes and strategies are indispensable operational instruments to enable the Community to function.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa33">Appropriate technical assistance to the OAU and its technical institutions would be appropriate during the initial stage of the Community. Many such requests have been taken up by United Nations institutions. But, such support should be better coordinated and given priority treatment in the United Nations system. Similarly, United Nations bodies working in Africa should include, at the regional and subregional level, activities which will promote regional cooperation in their respective areas and which will help attain the objectives of the African Economic Community.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa34">The African Economic Community will certainly take its first steps more easily if the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s were to be put into effect. Unfortunately, three years after the adoption of that Agenda we have learned, in the most recent joint report of the Committee for Programme and Coordination and Administrative Committee on Coordination (CPC/ACC), that Africa is the only region of the world where poverty will increase in the 1990s. If present trends were to continue, then the number of people in Africa living in a state of abject poverty, a figure of 216 million in 1990, will rise to 304 million between now and the year 2000.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa35">The lack of support for the New Agenda from certain donors is even harder to understand since the report of the Economic Commission for Africa of 1993 said that only 17 out of 52 African countries have reached the annual growth rate of 6 per cent set by the New Agenda. This means that more African countries would have attained this objective if there had been broader or more global support for the programme.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa36">Efforts by Africa to implement the New Agenda must meet with a more positive attitude from the international community. Otherwise, this programme, which gave rise to such high expectations in Africa, will meet the same fate as its predecessor, the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. In this context, the United Nations Secretariat structures responsible for the implementation of the New Agenda must be strengthened in order to generate greater resources and give it more visibility.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa37">My delegation welcomes the signing of the International Convention on Desertification. Similarly, it is our hope that the forthcoming World Summit for Social Development will provide specific answers to such burning problems as those regarding unemployment, poverty and health in Africa and give priority to Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg020-bk02-pa38">To conclude, as the Current Chairman of the African Group of States has already done, I appeal to all delegations to support draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.43</a> which, we hope, will be adopted by consensus.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV89-pg025-bk04-pa01">The United States is pleased to be able to join the consensus on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.43</a>. The record of cooperation between the United States and the Organization of African Unity shows a significant community of interest. To enlarge upon this cooperation is an objective of my Government and is being pursued energetically.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV89-pg025-bk04-pa02">Nevertheless, there are two points we would like to make about draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.43</a>. First, and with regard to paragraph 18, we note that the Secretary-General's report on the New Agenda brings attention to many development problems existing in African countries. The United States would have preferred it if a number of factors other than just debt relief, resource availability and the diversification of the economies of African countries had been mentioned there, in particular the importance of free markets and good governance. Secondly, the United States wishes to note that nothing in this draft resolution should be seen as prejudicing the outcome of negotiations at this year's session of the General Assembly on the draft resolution on the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. These negotiations are still under way.</p>
