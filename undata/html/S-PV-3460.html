	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the following other documents: <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1289.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1289</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1292.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1292</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1294.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1294</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1300.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1300</a>, letters dated 14, 14, 15 and 16 November 1994 respectively from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council; and <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1295.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1295</a>, letter dated 15 November 1994 from the Permanent Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the attack on the safe area of Bihac by aircraft belonging to the so-called Krajina Serb forces, which involved the dropping of napalm and cluster bombs in southwest Bihac, in clear violation of Bihac's status as a safe area. This violation is all the more grave because of the threat it poses to United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops deployed in the safe area of Bihac.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council also condemns the shelling by the so-called Krajina Serb forces from the United Nations Protected Areas as a flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and relevant Security Council resolutions. It demands that all parties and others concerned, in particular the so-called Krajina Serb forces, cease immediately all hostile actions across the international border between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council further demands an immediate end to all military activity which endangers the lives of the UNPROFOR personnel deployed in the Bihac area, and that all parties and others concerned, in particular the so-called Krajina Serb forces, restore the freedom of movement of UNPROFOR personnel in and around the Bihac area, including their unimpeded access to supplies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council calls on all parties and others concerned to refrain from any hostile action that could cause further escalation in the fighting and also calls on them to achieve urgently a cease-fire in the Bihac area".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-69.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/69</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
