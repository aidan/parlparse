	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Members of the Council have before them the third progress report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), <a href="../pdf/S-1995-350.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1995/350</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council has considered the Secretary-General's third progress report of 3 May 1995 (<a href="../pdf/S-1995-350.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/350</a>) on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) and the oral briefing from the Secretariat.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the positive developments in Angola. It welcomes in particular the meeting in Lusaka on 6 May 1995 between President Dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi, which took place in a positive atmosphere and gave new impetus to the consolidation of the peace process and the furthering of national reconciliation in Angola. The Council commends the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, of the observer States to the Angola peace process, of States of the region and, in particular, of the President of Zambia which assisted in bringing about this meeting. It expresses the hope that the meeting will mark the beginning of a regular and constructive dialogue between the President of Angola and the leader of UNITA.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction the progress in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex) concerning <i>inter alia </i>the reduction of cease-fire violations, the disengagement of forces, the cooperation among the parties and UNAVEM, the signing of the status of forces agreement and the providing of logistic facilities for the Mission. The Council welcomes the ongoing deployment of UNAVEM support units and stresses the importance of a timely deployment of the infantry battalions of UNAVEM III.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council is however concerned by the slow progress in other areas. It stresses the necessity for the increased cooperation of the Government and UNITA with the United Nations in carrying out all major provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions. While welcoming the release of the first group of prisoners, the Council urges the parties to expedite this process. Urgent attention should be given to the quartering of UNITA soldiers by the parties as well as the United Nations and the withdrawal of government troops to their barracks in order to permit the incorporation of UNITA troops within the national army and police in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol. The Council stresses also the importance of the completion of the disengagement process and the improvement of communication links with UNITA in all regions. It recalls the conditions set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-976(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 976 (1995)</a> for the deployment of infantry units and calls upon the parties in Angola to take all necessary steps to ensure that these conditions are met promptly for the timely deployment of sustainable infantry units throughout Angola capable of fully discharging their mandated tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council particularly underlines the urgency of a mine-clearance programme and calls upon the parties to provide, as promised, the funds and equipment necessary in order for the programme to become operational, and to begin mine-sweeping operations on major roads under their control. The demining, the opening of major roads and repair of air fields and other infrastructure are of crucial importance for the expeditious deployment of UNAVEM infantry units, the distribution of humanitarian aid, and the return of displaced persons to their places of origin. The Council invites the donors as well as the United Nations, its agencies and non-governmental organizations to support actively demining actions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council notes with satisfaction the amelioration of the humanitarian situation in Angola and calls upon the parties to cooperate without restriction with the United Nations and other humanitarian international organizations to facilitate the distribution of aid in all the regions and to intensify their efforts to guarantee the security of humanitarian transports and of UNAVEM personnel. It requests Member States to continue to support the ongoing humanitarian activities in Angola and to disburse as soon as possible the contributions pledged during the donors' meeting in February 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council will continue to monitor the situation in Angola closely and looks forward to the next monthly report of the Secretary-General."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1995-27.pdf" class="pdf">S/1995/PRST/27</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
