<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Qin Huasun</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">A significant breakthrough was recently achieved in the peace process in the region of the former Yugoslavia. The Government of Croatia and the local Serbian authorities signed a Basic Agreement. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia also initialled a Peace Agreement on the settlement of the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We warmly welcome these achievements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The signing of these agreements is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia region. It is also conducive to peace and stability in Europe and the world as a whole. We hope that the parties concerned will abide by these agreements so that the various ethnic groups and countries of that region can live in peace and harmony, and so that peace and stability may soon be achieved in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">The United Nations peace-keeping operations in the region of the former Yugoslavia have worked hard to prevent the spread of conflicts. They have contributed to relief activities and deployed preventive operations, acquiring experience in the process. Now that progress has been made in the peace process in the former Yugoslavia, the Secretary-General has proposed to the Security Council that the mandate of the three United Nations peace-keeping operations -- the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia, the United Nations Protection Force and the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force -- be extended as appropriate so that studies may be conducted on ways and means for the United Nations to participate in peace-keeping operations in this region in the future. The Chinese delegation agrees in principle with the Secretary-General's proposal and will vote in favour of the three draft resolutions before us.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">I should like to point out that the United Nations peace-keeping operations in this region have taught us many lessons. For instance, mandatory action under Chapter VII of the Charter involving the use of force, including air power, is most improper and has affected the legal and neutral status of these peace-keeping operations. The reservations of the Chinese delegation in this regard remain unchanged.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">We have noted that the Basic Agreement and the Peace Agreement both contain requests for the implementation of peace in this region. The United Nations and the Security Council will undoubtedly have to shoulder important responsibilities, since these requests involve many complex political, legal, military and financial questions. The Security Council must therefore make a careful study of these matters and discuss them thoroughly so that a sound decision can be taken in the light of the current situation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">People have been talking recently about the deployment of implementation forces in the region of the former Yugoslavia. That could be a major operation. If the Security Council has to take decisions to prevent these operations' departing from the principles governing United Nations peace-keeping operations and avoid the abuse of force and involvement in the conflict, these operations should be placed under the control and guidance of the United Nations and the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The Security Council should not become a rubber stamp with regard to matters beyond its control. No blank cheques should be written. In addressing these questions, the Security Council should adopt a prudent and responsible approach rather than rush into any commitment or decision. In this regard, the Chinese delegation is ready to carry out a sincere and in-depth study and discussion with other members of the Security Council.</p>
