	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the briefing it received on 17 December 2007 from the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, in which he made proposals on the political and security fronts and called on the international community to commit itself to a clear course of action. The Security Council looks forward to hearing more details on the proposals of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. The Security Council strongly supports the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to work towards lasting peace and stability in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the appointment of the new Prime Minister of Somalia and looks forward to the early establishment of an effective Government. The appointment of Nur Hassan Hussein offers a renewed opportunity to make further progress on dialogue and political reconciliation, on addressing the humanitarian crisis in Somalia and on implementing the outcomes of the National Reconciliation Congress, leading to a road map for the remainder of the transitional period and democratic elections in Somalia, as set out in the Transitional Federal Charter. The Security Council urges all Somali parties to reject violence and, with the support of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, to enter into a substantial dialogue aimed at achieving a full and all-inclusive national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council also welcomes the briefing on 6 December 2007 by the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, John Holmes, which included an account of his visit to Somalia. The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating humanitarian situation, aggravated by the prevailing security conditions in Somalia, and emphasizes again the need for strengthened efforts to provide humanitarian relief assistance to Somalia. The Security Council demands that all parties in Somalia ensure unfettered access for all humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations, fulfil their responsibilities and obligations under international humanitarian law and take the necessary measures to protect civilians.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its strong support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), calls on all Somali parties to cooperate fully with it, urges again the international community to provide financial resources, personnel, equipment and services for the full deployment of AMISOM and repeats its request that the Secretary-General consult with the African Union Commission on what further support might be provided to AMISOM.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council also reiterates its request that the Secretary-General develop the existing contingency plans for the possible deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation to succeed AMISOM, as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1772(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1772 (2007)</a>. The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to report by 8 February 2008 on progress made in this regard."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-49.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/49</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
