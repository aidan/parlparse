	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2005-89.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/89</a>, containing the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Somalia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council reaffirms all its previous decisions concerning the situation in Somalia, in particular the statement by its President (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2004-43.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2004/43</a>) dated 19 November 2004.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General of 18 February 2005 (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-89.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/89</a>), reaffirms its commitment to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the situation in Somalia and its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council welcomes the progress made in the Somali national reconciliation process, in particular the ongoing relocation efforts of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), expects further progress in this regard and stresses the need for the international community to provide strong political, financial and capacity-building support for these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council commends the efforts of the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in support of the TFG. The Council reiterates its support for the African Union's efforts in assisting the process of transition in Somalia. The Council recognizes the African Union's readiness to play an important role in a future peace support mission in Somalia. Such a mission must be carefully considered and planned and would require the support of the Somali people.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council urges all Somali factions and militia leaders to cease hostilities and encourages them and the TFG to enter into immediate negotiations for a comprehensive and verifiable ceasefire agreement leading to final disarmament, and welcomes the willingness of the United Nations to provide advice in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council expresses its gratitude to all those donors who have supported the peace process in Somalia and encourages donor countries and regional and subregional organizations to contribute to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Somalia, in particular through efforts coordinated by United Nations agencies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council welcomes the establishment of the Coordination and Monitoring Committee (CMC), chaired jointly by the Prime Minister of the TFG and the United Nations, through which donor countries and regional and subregional organizations can provide support to the efforts of the TFG.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council stresses that improving the humanitarian situation is an essential component of support for the peace and reconciliation process. The Council strongly believes that ensuring humanitarian access to all Somalis in need and providing guarantees for the safety and security of aid workers is an immediate priority and obligation of the TFG.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council welcomes the efforts of the United Nations Political Office in Somalia (UNPOS) and its leading role in coordinating support for the TFG to implement the agreements reached at the Somali National Reconciliation Conference and establish peace and stability in Somalia. The Security Council takes note of the need to expand the United Nations presence as proposed in the report of the Secretary-General of 18 February 2005 (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-89.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/89</a>). The Council concurs with the Secretary-General that a further enhanced role for the Organization in Somalia must be incremental and should be based on the outcome of discussions with the TFG.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support for the peace process in Somalia and the commitment of the United Nations to assist the regional and subregional efforts in this regard."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-11.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/11</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
