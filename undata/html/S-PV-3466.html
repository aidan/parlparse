	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reiterates its deep concern over the deteriorating situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly the Bihac region, and especially in the safe area of Bihac. It condemns in the strongest possible terms all the violations of the safe area of Bihac by whomsoever committed, and in particular, the flagrant and blatant entry into the safe area by the Bosnian Serb forces. It also notes with concern the hostilities around Velika Kladusa. It demands that all parties and others concerned agree to and implement an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in the Bihac region, and in particular in and around the safe area of Bihac. It calls on all parties to intensify negotiations for a cease-fire and a cessation of hostilities throughout the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in pursuit of the territorial settlement for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina proposed by the Contact Group as part of an overall peace settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expresses its full support for the continued efforts by United Nations personnel to achieve a cease-fire in the Bihac area, as well as for UNPROFOR's efforts to implement its mandate to deter attacks against the safe areas. The Council insists on the withdrawal of all Bosnian Serb military forces from the Bihac safe area and on the need to ensure full respect by all parties of the safe areas, particularly for the benefit of the civilian population. The Council calls on all parties and others concerned fully to cooperate with these efforts. The Council underlines the terms of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-836(1993).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 836 (1993)</a>, which enable UNPROFOR to carry out its mandate in relation to safe areas.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council commends UNPROFOR, including those of its personnel serving in the Bihac region, and in particular the Bangladeshi troops, for the important contributions they are making under the most difficult conditions. It calls on the parties and all others concerned to ensure freedom of movement for UNPROFOR and UNHCR personnel and access to necessary supplies for UNPROFOR and the civilian population throughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council condemns violations of the international border between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the so-called Krajina Serb forces and others concerned in the Bihac region. It demands that all hostile acts across that international border cease immediately and also demands that all so-called Krajina Serb forces withdraw immediately from the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the proposed territorial settlement for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which has been put by the Contact Group to the parties as part of an overall peace settlement. The Council reiterates its condemnation of the Bosnian Serb party's refusal to accept the proposed territorial settlement and demands that that party accept it unconditionally and in full.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council will monitor compliance with the terms of this statement and react appropriately."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-71.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/71</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
