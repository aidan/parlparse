	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council recalls the decisions and recommendations contained in the declaration on ensuring an effective role for the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, particularly in Africa, adopted at its meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in the course of the Millennium Summit (<a href="../pdf/S-RES-1318(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1318 (2000)</a> of 7 September 2000, annex), and the open debate held on 7 March 2001 to review its implementation. The Council takes note with interest of the important views expressed by non-members at this debate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council notes the progress achieved in translating the commitments made at its Summit meeting into practical results and expresses its determination to intensify efforts to this end. The Council underlines the importance of the Declaration as a contribution towards the development of a well-targeted strategy and shared vision in the maintenance of international peace and security and of the deeper and broader involvement of Member States and the wider international community in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council will consider and take appropriate action on the Secretary-General's forthcoming report on conflict prevention, his recommendations on the strengthening of the United Nations capacity to develop peace-building strategies, the report prepared by its Working Group on General Issues of Sanctions, and the recommendations on improving the three-way relationship between the Council, the troop-contributing countries and the Secretariat to be prepared by its Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations, and reiterates its intention to review periodically the implementation of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1327(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1327 (2000)</a> of 13 November 2000 on strengthening peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council underlines the need for closer cooperation and interaction within the United Nations system in addressing the challenges to peace and security, including the root causes of conflicts, and intends to continue taking concrete steps in advancing this goal. The Council also expresses its willingness to continue to develop productive working relationships with regional and subregional organizations in addressing conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council decides to conduct further reviews, with the active participation of non-members, of the implementation of the commitments made at its meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-10.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/10</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
