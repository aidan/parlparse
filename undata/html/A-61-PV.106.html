	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">Under the terms of operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly decides</p>
	<blockquote id="pg001-bk04-pa03">"to establish, at its sixty-second session, an ad hoc working group on the revitalization of the General Assembly, open to all Member States, to evaluate and assess the status of implementation of relevant resolutions, to identify ways to further enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and efficiency of the General Assembly, inter alia, by building on previous resolutions, and to submit a report thereon to the General Assembly".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Pursuant to the aforementioned operative paragraph of the draft resolution, it is understood that the exact dates for meetings of the working group would be determined in consultation between the substantive secretariat and Conference Services, subject to the availability of conference facilities and services allocated for the General Assembly and its working groups. It is further understood that the working group cannot meet at the same time as the General Assembly is meeting and that no two working groups of the General Assembly can meet simultaneously.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">Should the General Assembly adopt <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.65.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.65</a>, the establishment of the aforementioned working group would constitute an addition to the draft calendar of conferences and meetings of the United Nations. However, as the required conference servicing resources of the working group would be allocated from those already earmarked for meetings of the General Assembly, no additional conference servicing resources would be required.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01"> The General Assembly has just adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-292.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/292</a>, on revitalizing the role and authority of the Assembly and strengthening its performance. I commend all Member States for their support and cooperation throughout this process. It gives me also great pleasure to congratulate the two facilitators, Ambassador Badji, the Permanent Representative of Senegal, and Ambassador Bodini, the Permanent Representative of San Marino, for their tireless efforts and dedication in leading the consultations on this important agenda item. I wish to express my most sincere appreciation to the facilitators for conducting wide-ranging consultations, which provided members with an opportunity to convey their concerns and expectations on how best to revitalize the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">The resolution just adopted stresses the importance of implementing General Assembly resolutions on revitalization. It is our common responsibility. I am convinced that the report that will be submitted by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 1 of the resolution will assist Member States in this task. In this context, it should provide the ad hoc working group called for in paragraph 2 with the basis for its future deliberations. I welcome this new step to strengthen the performance of the General Assembly, an objective to which I am personally committed. On the basis of my discussions with the President-elect, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, I trust that this matter will be given the full attention it deserves during the sixty-second session.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">First of all, I want to thank you, Madam President, on behalf of Ambassador Badji of Senegal and myself, for the very kinds words that you just used about us and for having given us, on 9 March, such a major responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">Paul Badji and I tried to fulfil the mission you gave to us to the best of our capacity. In that regard, I wish also to thank your staff for their great work and the Secretary-General for helping us in our work and in our planning. But most of all, I would like to thank our colleagues, who were kind enough to spend so much time with us in sometimes gruelling meetings. Paul and I are also thankful to have learned so much about our colleagues' willingness to change the way we do business in the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">We have provided members with a paper that summarizes some of the ideas that our colleagues expressed to us. I hope that most of the ideas -- and most of them are very good ideas -- will not get lost and will be the basis for the process of revitalization at the sixty-second session.</p>
