<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I should like to recall that at its 3590th meeting, on 7 November 1995, the Security Council adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1018(1995).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1018 (1995)</a>, in which it decided that the election to fill the vacancy in the International Court of Justice should take place on 28 February 1996 at a meeting of the Security Council and at a meeting of the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">This morning the Security Council and the General Assembly will proceed independently with the election, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Statute of the Court, for the purpose of filling this vacancy. The list of candidates nominated by national groups and received by the Secretary-General within the required time for submission, that is, by 2 February 1996, is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1996-52.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/52</a> and Add.1. <a href="../pdf/S-1996-133.pdf" class="pdf">Document S/1996/133</a> contains the name of a candidate nominated by a national group and received by the Secretary-General after 2 February 1996. <a href="../pdf/S-1996-53.pdf" class="pdf">Document S/1996/53</a> contains the curricula vitae of the candidates nominated by the national groups.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">The Security Council also has before it, in <a href="../pdf/S-1996-51.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/51</a>, a memorandum by the Secretary-General describing the present composition of the Court and setting out the procedure to be followed in the conduct of the election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">I should like to remind the Council that under Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the International Court of Justice,</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"Those candidates who obtain an absolute majority of votes in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">The required majority in the Security Council is eight votes.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">Article 15 of the Statute of the Court provides that</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"A member of the Court elected to replace a member whose term of office has not expired shall hold office for the remainder of his predecessor's term."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">Accordingly, the member elected to fill the remainder of the term left vacant by the death of Judge Andrés Aguilar Mawdsley will serve until 5 February 2000.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">The voting will be by secret ballot. When we proceed to the vote, members of the Council will receive a ballot paper containing the names of the candidates. No withdrawal will be accepted once the ballot papers have been distributed. However, it would be possible to withdraw between ballots. Members of the Council will be requested to place an "X" next to the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. Votes may be cast only for a candidate whose name appears on the ballot paper, and each elector may vote for only one candidate; otherwise, the ballot will be considered invalid. When a candidate has obtained the required majority, I shall notify the President of the General Assembly of the name of that candidate, and I shall request the Council to remain in session pending the receipt from the President of the General Assembly of the result of the voting in the Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">I shall now draw lots to select two delegations to serve as tellers.</p>
