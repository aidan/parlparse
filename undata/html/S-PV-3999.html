	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The United States strongly supports the resolution before us today. This resolution demonstrates the Council's resolve to ensure that the sanctions imposed against UNITA are implemented fully. Only through the implementation of these sanctions can the international community diminish UNITA's war-making ability and improve the prospects for a political settlement of this conflict, a conflict that continues to exact a painful toll on the people of Angola.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">The United States welcomes and expresses its appreciation for the initiative of Ambassador Fowler, Chairman of the Angola sanctions Committee, who will travel to countries in the region over the next several weeks to discuss ways to improve the implementation of sanctions against UNITA.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">The United States also welcomes the establishment of expert panels to investigate sanctions violations, and we hope to provide personnel for them. However, we must clarify our understanding of the budgetary provisions of this resolution. We understand that the expenses of these panels will be met primarily from a United Nations Trust Fund established for this purpose and through the redeployment of existing resources of the regular budget as necessary. The United States expects to make a contribution to the Fund, and we urge other States to contribute similarly.</p>
