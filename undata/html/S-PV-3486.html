It commends the efforts of all who worked to achieve them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">"The Security Council stresses the importance it attaches to immediate and full compliance with the agreements. It attaches the highest priority at this juncture to the timely completion of the various steps envisaged in the agreement on a complete cessation of hostilities. It looks to the parties and others concerned to cooperate fully with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in their implementation. The Security Council calls upon all forces to cease fighting around Bihac. It supports efforts in train to strengthen UNPROFOR, and encourages Member States to make available the personnel and equipment needed for UNPROFOR to supervise and monitor the agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa07">"The Security Council will continue its consideration of all aspects of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the Secretary-General's report of 1 December 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1389.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1389</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa08">"The Security Council deems it imperative to intensify efforts under the auspices of the Contact Group to achieve an overall settlement on the basis of the acceptance of the peace plan of the Contact Group as a starting point.
