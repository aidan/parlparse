	<p id="pg002-bk01-pa01">The meeting resumed at 3.15 p.m.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01"> I thank colleagues for both the substance and the brevity of their contributions this morning. As many as 20 speakers remain for this afternoon, so I shall ask for continued cooperation in that regard.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Amin</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">It is an honour, Mr. President, to have Your Excellency presiding over this meeting. Your presence signifies the importance that the Council attaches to the United Nations mission in East Timor and to the future of that country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa02">We all hail the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, for his outstanding leadership of the United Nations mission in East Timor. Together with the people and the leadership of East Timor, he has presented us with a remarkable success story, as has been mentioned by previous speakers.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa03">Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Chief Minister of the Second Transitional Government of East Timor, Mr. Mari Alkatiri, the first elected leader of East Timor to address the Security Council, as Ambassador Cunningham said earlier. We also recognize with high appreciation the participation of the representatives of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and of the World Bank, vital partners in the United Nations mission in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa04">I shall try to be extremely brief. The presidential statement that will be issued following this meeting will broadly reflect our views. I shall speak on five specific points.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa05">The first, as the Secretary-General underlined in his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-983.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/983</a>), is the need for strong regional relationships. In that context, we pay tribute to President Megawati Soekarnoputri for her initiative regarding the meetings held on 12 September. We call on the leadership of Indonesia and of East Timor to follow up the meetings of 12 September with a view to resolving outstanding matters, including border issues, transit between the Oecussi enclave and East Timor and cultural cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa06">Secondly, we stress the need for a strong, functioning civil administration. This, as the Secretary-General says, will be key to the fate of the country in the post-independence period. We in Bangladesh went through such an experience following our independence on 16 December 1971. The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) has made substantive progress in putting in place the essential elements of an East Timorese public administration. This needs to be supported and the progress sustained.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa07">Thirdly, public finances and critical areas of the civilian administration need the support of the international community. We are confident that the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank are fully seized of the matter. The loss of revenue, including from service taxes and import duties, that will follow the downsizing of UNTAET, should be factored into the planning of support for public finances.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa08">Special attention will need to be paid to donor support for the two primary trust funds -- the trust fund for the national budget and the trust fund for capital investment and recovery. A key element in ensuring a minimum level of international backstopping is the provision of assured assistance. We, like others in the Council, believe that United Nations support to the East Timorese Government should be provided through assessed contributions -- a cardinal point in the report of the Secretary-General, and one that he reiterated to us this morning. At the same time, the bilateral donors, international financial institutions, funds and programmes should fulfil their pledges early in terms of supplementing United Nations efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa09">That brings me to the specific issue of the efficient management of public finances. The East Timorese leadership should be encouraged to pay particular attention to this aspect. The Security Council has been grappling with some post-conflict peace-building situations affected by the management factor. Employment, especially for young people, is critically important in a post-conflict scenario. The lack of employment for young people after independence may spoil the prospects for success. We have seen the impact of unemployed youth in our national context; that is a part of our history.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa10">The independence of East Timor must not be derailed by a creeping sense of frustration or disillusionment. As the economy of East Timor is structured on a new premise, Bangladesh would like to stress the importance of indigenous solutions in addressing Timorese socio-economic development. For our part, the Grameen Bank is already assisting the Timorese to initiate microcredit programmes for poverty eradication and empowerment, particularly of women. Such civil-society-based indigenous approaches, adapted to the Timorese context, could yield positive results in other social sectors, including in areas like basic education and health care. This would also contribute positively to building East Timorese capacities, which is a primary objective of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa11">We were happy to note the Chief Minister's statement that legislative issues relating to microcredit banks are currently being revised. We would appreciate it if the Special Representative of the Secretary-General would elaborate on how UNTAET sees the viability of such quick impact projects in bolstering subsistence agriculture in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa12">My fifth point relates to transition and the UNTAET successor mission. Bangladesh endorses the Secretary-General's recommendations for the transition and the plan for the successor mission. We are particularly happy that the Council's stress on a sound exit strategy has been reflected in the plan presented by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa13">Finally, we look forward to 20 May 2002 -- 200 days from now -- when we can join the people of East Timor in celebrating their independence. We look forward to welcoming them among the community of nations. Bangladesh remains committed to continuing to work with the people of East Timor, within our modest capacity and means, up to that date and beyond.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jerandi</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I should like first of all to express the satisfaction of my delegation at seeing you, Mr. Minister, presiding over this meeting of the Security Council today. We would also like to welcome Mr. Mari Alkatiri, and to express to him Tunisia's support for all that is being accomplished in East Timor. Our thanks also go to the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme for their commitment to East Timor in particular, and to the consolidation of peace in general throughout the world.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I should also like to thank Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello for his statement on developments in the situation in East Timor and on the progress achieved with regard to a post-independence international presence. I should also like to express once again the satisfaction of my delegation with his remarkable accomplishments in East Timor, and to thank him for the honour that he has brought to our Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">I would like to begin by stressing how important it is for us to support the recommendations of the Secretary-General regarding the form that a post-independence United Nations presence should take. The most important requirement is to preserve what the United Nations, its institutions, non-governmental organizations and the entire international community have already achieved in that country. We must continue to provide such support, especially during the next stage, which will be just as important as those that have gone before, with a view to laying a solid foundation for a new East Timorese society.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">We believe that two concepts in particular are extremely important when we take decisions intended to promote the well-being and stability of that country: exit strategy and peace-building. We are convinced that we must not be hasty in disengaging from East Timor. We therefore call upon all the parties to give their support to a progressive process that will lead to the establishment of a stable, democratic State, with the assistance of the United Nations, donor countries and, in particular, the countries of the region, whose role is very important for subregional stability and security. We support the Secretary-General's request to extend the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor until independence is declared, in order to ensure continuity in our efforts. My delegation is pleased to endorse the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly that stipulates that East Timor will become independent on 20 May 2002.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">To that end, we support the structuring of the tasks to be accomplished by United Nations personnel over a period of at least two years after East Timor becomes independent. We expect the tasks defined in paragraphs 61 and 76 of the Secretary-General's report to be gradually transferred to the Timorese, so that in due course they will be able to take charge of their own destiny in all fields, as described by Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello in his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">Of course, the integration of East Timor into its own regional environment is of great importance. It must have cooperative relations, especially with Indonesia, and -- as Indonesian and Timorese leaders have said -- those relations must be forward-looking. There are many historical, human and economic factors in favour of a shared destiny for the two countries. We should encourage them to move forward in that endeavour.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Krokhmal</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">Like previous speakers, I wish to welcome you, Mr. Minister, as you preside over today's meetings of the Security Council. We are also pleased to see here the Chief Minister of the Second Transitional Government of East Timor, Mr. Alkatiri, and are grateful for his important statement. Let me thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, for his usual comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">We believe that the report of the Secretary-General and his video address today to the Security Council complement one another, providing a deep analysis of the long-term tasks that lie ahead of the East Timorese and the United Nations on the way towards independence for East Timor. In view of the long list of speakers we have today, I shall confine myself to a few remarks, in particular in respect of the concept of a further international presence in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">We cannot but mention that significant progress has been in the implementation of key elements of the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), including the transition to independence, the establishment of a public administration and the creation of a stable security environment. We are encouraged that much progress has been achieved in the field of economic and social development, in the health and education sector in East Timor and in the building of the East Timorese civil service. In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the UNTAET staff for their efforts, and personally to the Special Representative, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, for his able and effective leadership of the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">At the same time, there should be no doubt that once independent, East Timor will still require further substantial international support in many areas in order to ensure security in the country and the viability and stability of its government structures. We believe that such support could be provided through an integrated successor mission mandated by the Security Council. We need a comprehensive, realistic and lasting concept of this mission, based on the recent conditions and the future needs and aspirations of the East Timorese -- first of all, in those areas requiring ongoing support. In this context, we endorse the valuable recommendations contained in the recent report of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">We are of the opinion that the Security Council's strategies in East Timor will require the inclusion in the successor mission of military, civilian police and civilian components. Security requires, in effect, a police and military presence. We feel it is essential that such a presence be proportionate to the security risks and threats that might exist on the ground. We therefore support the need for a continuing force, the size of which has to be determined, to maintain a secure environment. The peacekeeping force should be highly mobile, with the ability to counter an external threat and provide security support to attend to trouble spots inside the country. We believe that a peacekeeping force will continue to operate in close coordination with the East Timor Defence Force to maintain a secure environment, with a particular emphasis on a robust presence in the border areas.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">It is important to enable the East Timorese to play an increasingly greater role in enforcing public safety and in defence of East Timor's borders. We are of the view that the United Nations has to stage its drawdown in step with the gradual establishment of the East Timor Defence Force and the East Timorese police. The raising of the Timorese infantry battalion and the opening of the training facility are significant achievements. The establishment of an effective East Timorese police force is a crucial element that needs to be developed. To my mind, the role of the civilian police component is greatly increasing, and the main objective of the civilian police component will be to promote the capacity of the East Timor police force and to endorse institutional structures in the field. We agree with the Secretary-General that the substantial strength of the United Nations civilian police should be maintained until East Timor police are fully trained and deployed.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">Although great strides have been made towards the Timorization of UNTAET, for certain critical areas of government, local expertise does not exist, and the civilian professional staff need to remain within a successor mission to provide key assistance to the new Government. It is our view that the strengthening of national justice, human rights structures and capacities can be an important element in ensuring the stability of the achievements of the peacekeeping operations in East Timor after its withdrawal. These areas will need the particular attention of a successor mission. It is right and important that adequate and timely funding be available for both military and civilian components.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">We are convinced that a substantial international presence will include a wider range of United Nations agencies and programmes engaged in East Timor, as well as other international financial institutions and donors. This morning we listened carefully to the important statements by the representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme outlining the involvement of their institutions in East Timor. We consider their participation very useful in the Security Council discussions on future strategies for peace-building.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa09">I would like to end by looking ahead. We must carefully consider the timing and consequences of a reduction of the international presence in East Timor. Our exit strategy should be greatly dependent on progress in capacity-building, especially in the areas of the police, the justice system, institutional capacity and long-term security in East Timor.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Ireland.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">I welcome Mr. Vieira de Mello here today and express my deep appreciation for his personal commitment, and that of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), to assisting in the transition of East Timor and to developing detailed plans for the future United Nations presence there. I thank Mr. Karlsson of the World Bank and Mr. Diabre of the United Nations Development Programme for their useful and informative interventions. I welcome in particular Mr. Alkatiri, Mr. Borges and Mr. de Araújo. Like them and the brave people they represent, Ireland warmly anticipates the day when, instead of being visitors in the Security Council, East Timor will take its rightful place in the General Assembly of this world Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The Permanent Representative of Belgium will later make a statement on behalf of the European Union; Ireland agrees fully with that statement.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">Ireland applauds the dignity and integrity with which the Timorese people performed their most recent collective act of self-determination: the national elections in August. They have drawn strength from international support to create their own new political dispensation. Next 20 May, they will join together in formally declaring and celebrating their independence. We will all wish to share in the joy and hope for the future which will be born on that occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">The United Nations has helped a nation to rise to its feet, but we must walk with it a bit longer before returning home. This Organization will have a vital role in maintaining progress in East Timor towards an effective administration and full independence for the first time after four centuries of external rule. At this critical time, we cannot be seen to diminish our responsibility and commitment to this capacity-building process.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The Irish Government supports the recent report of the Secretary-General and agrees with his assessment that a premature withdrawal of the international presence could have a destabilizing effect in a number of crucial areas. We agree that the United Nations must remain engaged in East Timor in order to protect the major achievements so far realized, and we believe that a substantial international presence will be necessary up to and after independence.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">To underpin this commitment, we endorse fully the Secretary-General's recommendations for an integrated mission mandated by the Security Council. This should comprise military, civilian police and civilian components, and include provision for vital human rights and justice elements. The downsizing of UNTAET and the international presence should be phased only in line with the development of local capacity. I am pleased that an Irish troop contingent will continue to serve with UNTAET and its successor mission.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">Support for East Timor in its post-independence phase should be by the United Nations membership as a whole, and we believe strongly, therefore, that a successor mission should be funded from assessed contributions. Even with political progress, East Timor's economic prospects are such that it will be essential to maintain significant aid flows to its fiscal base. We commend the enormous advances already made by East Timor in key sectors, with the support of the United Nations and World Bank trust funds, the development banks and other members of the international donor community.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">The development of East Timor must be driven by the wishes of its people and not by donor priorities. Close coordination will be necessary between the United Nations development bodies, principally UNDP, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and bilateral donors to ensure that resources are used effectively and coherently in support of local capacity-building. Bilaterally, Ireland has planned to double its aid allocation to East Timor next year.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">Our task for the next few years will be to facilitate the emergence of a strong and vibrant nation -- one that has been built by the people and for the people. East Timor needs our commitment, during the critical period of transition to independence, to its achieving full political, economic and social freedom. We should rise to the challenge and engage with the people of East Timor in delivering their future.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">The next speaker is the representative of Belgium. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. De Loecker</span> <span class="nation">Belgium</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Allow me, Mr. President, on behalf of the European Union, to extend to you a very warm welcome to New York and in particular to welcome your presence here as you preside over the Security Council during this crucial debate.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries of Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area -- Iceland and Liechtenstein -- align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">First of all, I should first like very warmly to welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and once again to offer him our warm congratulations for the work he has done to date as head of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). We are particularly pleased to note the presence here of several members of the Transitional Government who were democratically elected to the Constituent Assembly, and we extend a warm welcome to the Chief Minister, Mr. Mari Alkatiri; his Minister for Finance, Ms. Fernanda Borges, and his Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Mr. Fernando de Araujo. The European Union takes this unique opportunity to assure them, with confidence and conviction, of its support in the exercise of their duties.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The people of East Timor are living in remarkable and very stimulating times. Their elected representatives in the Assembly have begun the process of drafting the Constitution of the future State. As the Special Representative of the Secretary-General has just confirmed, that work is going well and they are making good headway. The European Union welcomes this. It is important that the views of the Timorese people, as set out in the reports of the district Constitutional Commissions of June and July this year, before the electoral campaign, be reflected in the finalized draft Constitution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">We welcome the decision taken by the Constituent Assembly, further recommended by the Secretary-General, to schedule for next May the transfer of UNTAET's powers of sovereignty to the Government of the State of East Timor. That will give the Timorese time to ensure a smooth transition and to allow for the gradual, but necessary, stabilization of administrative structures.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">The likely holding of the first presidential elections of the new State will be another important step towards democracy and the construction of a viable nation. We agree with the Secretary-General that the elections should take place before the declaration of independence, so that, before it leaves, UNTAET can ensure that the elections go smoothly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">The continuing activities of the militias in West Timor remain one of our principal concerns. We are pleased to note, however, the increase in the number of refugees who are returning to East Timor. We underline the importance of a swift conclusion of a memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and the Indonesian Government to allow for the return of humanitarian agencies, so that they can assist in the repatriation efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa08">We thank the Secretary-General for drawing up plans for the future international presence in East Timor. The European Union has taken due note of the suggested reduction in the size of its military, civilian police and civil administration components. That reconfiguration, proposed following numerous consultations with the representatives of the Timorese people, should make it possible for the principal needs of the people to be met once independence has been declared. The Union therefore endorses the Secretary-General's recommendations for an integrated mission and looks forward to his further recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa09">The European Union hopes that the dialogue between UNTAET, the Secretariat, the Timorese people and all the other actors involved in East Timor will continue, in order to ensure the progressive adaptation of UNTAET and a painless transition to its successor mission, in line with the needs of the people.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa10">As the Secretary-General emphasized in his report, the departure of United Nations staff will have a negative impact on Timor's economy. The international community must ensure that this impact is minimized, and the working group's recommendations on the subject are expected shortly.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa11">In future the international presence must continue the considerable efforts under way in the area of reconstruction. The European Union will participate in these efforts, in cooperation with the international financial institutions and all of the actors involved. The European Union will continue to attach particular importance to the process of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa12">It is indispensable that the perpetrators of the serious crimes committed in 1999 be brought to justice. Training of staff and future civil servants of the State of Timor in criminal and administrative justice and of the Serious Crimes Unit is crucial in this respect. We reiterate our call for the Jakarta authorities to conclude the appeals proceedings in the case of the murder last year of three Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees workers in Atambua.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa13">Reconstruction efforts will also have to address the improvement of health-care and education services as well as the rehabilitation of transport networks, so that the living conditions of the Timorese can gradually return to normal. The European Commission, which hosted the donors' conference last December, is currently finalizing its strategy aimed at supporting development efforts in East Timor in the medium and long term.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa14">UNTAET's success is undeniable, and the ground that has been covered since autumn 1999 is remarkable. The international community must also ensure the success of the process of UNTAET's departure and the transition to an international presence that will be both effective and efficient in its reconstruction efforts. The United Nations Secretariat and its various departments have the European Union's full support in this task and in planning the next stages.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Seixas da Costa</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">Portugal fully supports the previous statement, delivered by the representative of Belgium, Ambassador Stéphane De Loecker, on behalf of the presidency of the European Union. As many of our views are contained in that statement, I will focus on specific points to which my country attaches particular importance at this juncture.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">Allow me at the outset, Mr. President, to underline and to welcome your presence here today as an expression of the importance Ireland has always attached to East Timor. For many years I had the privilege of witnessing the commitment of your country, and your personal commitment in particular, to this question, and it is for me a very happy occasion to see you here today presiding over this meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">I would like to start by conveying Portugal's deep appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report on East Timor. His recommendations set out clearly the way for a smooth and gradual transfer of responsibilities from the United Nations to the legitimate Timorese authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello -- whose excellent work deserves all our gratitude and has been an important factor of prestige for the United Nations -- gave us his reading of the facts, and we are very grateful for that. I would like to subscribe <i>mot par mot</i> to what my colleague, the Permanent Representative of France, Jean-David Levitte, said about the role of Sergio Vieira de Mello, about the quality of his work and his outstanding contribution to the prestige of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">The Council also had the opportunity to hear Chief Minister Mari Alkatiri, head of the Timorese delegation, which also includes the Minister of Finance, Ms. Fernanda Borges, and the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Fernando Araujo. I hope his briefing on the situation on the ground has helped the Security Council to make a better assessment of how the things are and what must be done in order to prepare the road for independence. I think his realism, but also his vision, represent a clear guarantee that the Timorese affairs will remain in good hands.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">I also want to thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to listen to presentations by the representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which have played and will continue to play a very important role in the transition of East Timor to independence.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">Portugal has several times before commended the work of the Timorese and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). The progress achieved in areas as diverse as the rehabilitation of infrastructure, the reopening of schools, the provision of basic health care, the setting up of a civil service and the establishment of police and armed forces is remarkable and truly impressive. We believe that such progress has set East Timor on a successful path to independence, and we hope this course can be maintained and sustained. The engagement and support of the Security Council as a whole, and its members individually, has been fundamental in achieving such results. We trust the Council will continue to support this effort and make East Timor a positive precedent for the future of United Nations operations.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">I cannot overemphasise the importance of ensuring sustainable peace and security in East Timor, especially in the light of the present international situation. That region of the world has enough factors of instability, and we should not create the conditions for more to arise.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09"><a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Resolution 1272 (1999)</a> clearly states that the mandate of UNTAET consists of the following elements:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg007-bk02-pa10">"to provide security and maintain law and order throughout the territory of East Timor; to establish an effective administration; to assist in the development of civil and social services; to ensure the coordination and delivery of humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and development assistance; to support capacity-building for self-government; to assist in the establishment of conditions for sustainable development".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa11">This mandate was unprecedented in scope and complexity. In spite of UNTAET's tireless effort, these tasks will not have been completed by the time of independence. The overall security and political situation will still be fragile. Therefore, it is vital to safeguard and build upon the progress achieved in order not to jeopardize the enormous investment made by the international community and, in particular, by the Timorese themselves, including in terms of human lives.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa12">This Council, in fact, has already acknowledged this fact by stressing, on several occasions, the need for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa13">Allow me now to focus on the specific proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in his report. We understand that these proposals still need to be refined. Further planning will need to be made in the light of the outcome of the Constituent Assembly, the views of the all-Timorese Transitional Cabinet, coordination among all international actors, and the security developments on the ground. But we strongly believe that the report of the Secretary-General contains the right framework for the future presence of the United Nations in East Timor. As a major troop-contributing country, Portugal fully supports the Secretary-General's plans for the establishment of an integrated mission, with a military, police and civilian component, including a civilian unit to support the future independent Government.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa14">We believe both the numbers and timing proposed by the Secretary-General for reductions in all components are rational and sensible. His recommendations for the post-independence period are achievable within the foreseeable future, which is more than can be said of other United Nations operations. They are also affordable, as the amounts involved will be reasonably small, especially if we think that this may be the only success story for the United Nations in recent years. Most of all, they are absolutely indispensable to insuring the fulfilment of UNTAET's mandate and avoiding jeopardizing everything that has been achieved until now.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa15">In considering the future of East Timor and the United Nations role in it, it is fundamental to address the question of justice and human rights. We welcome the progress made so far both in the establishment of a Timorese judiciary and in the setting up of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We also welcome the progress made in the investigation of the serious crimes committed in East Timor in the course of 1999. However, efforts in this area need to continue, as they are fundamental for the long-term political and social stability in the country. Portugal therefore supports the Secretary-General's plans to include in the post-independence United Nations mission a serious crimes unit and a strong human rights presence throughout the territory.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa16">Portugal hopes this Council can agree on endorsing the recommendations put forward by the Secretary-General for the post-independence mission in East Timor. Anything short of that would risk conveying a very negative message to the Timorese, to the United Nations on the ground and to the region. I trust that that is not what the Council wants at this point.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa17">The United Nations success in East Timor will not be measured just by its achievements in the three or four years in which it was present in the country. Rather, it will be judged in the light of the sustainability of those achievements, especially of the administration and institutional framework it leaves behind.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa18">As the Secretary-General rightly pointed out in his report "Ultimately, the responsibility to establish a viable state in East Timor clearly belongs to its people." We couldn't agree more. The Timorese have fought for years to gain their independence. They have demonstrated enormous courage and political maturity. They have shown they want to be responsible for their own destiny and have the capacity for that But they have also asked for our support -- a modest support, actually, in face of the daunting tasks ahead of them. It is a duty for us, the United Nations, to assist them in that endeavour. It is for this Council simply to act according to the responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Akasaka</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">I would like to express, on behalf of the Japanese Government, our gratitude to you, Mr. President, for travelling from Ireland to New York in order to chair today's public meeting on the situation in East Timor. We sincerely appreciate the leadership of Ireland on this important matter.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">My appreciation also goes to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and to the Chief Minister of the Transitional Government of East Timor and the other members of the delegation for their presence at this meeting today.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">At the outset, I would like to thank Secretary-General Annan for putting together the report on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). The Government of Japan welcomes this report, which is the valuable result of the work done in New York and in Dili over the past several months.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">It would have been desirable if the report had been more detailed with regard to the shape of the United Nations presence in the post-independence period. But we understand well that making accurate assessments of the situation on the ground and drawing up an optimal and feasible plan based on those assessments are not easy tasks. I am therefore grateful to Mr. Vieira de Mello, who has provided us today with additional details to supplement the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">It is important that the Security Council provide, at an early date, as clear an indication as possible with respect to the continued presence of the United Nations in the post-independence period. This is necessary in order to give assurance and encouragement to the people of East Timor, as well as to those countries which have a strong interest in the political stability and economic and social development of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">As rightly pointed out in the Secretary-General's report, the follow-on mission should include a military component, a civilian police component and a component for civil administration. In this context, the Government of Japan supports the Secretary-General's concept of a United Nations mission in the post-independence period.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">We hope that, based upon the further accelerated work of the Secretariat in the coming weeks, the follow-on mission will be endorsed in the form of a Security Council resolution by the end of next January, when UNTAET's mandate is to be renewed. It is advisable that discussions commence promptly on detailed and concrete plans for these components, including the level and modality of funding.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">I am pleased to see that the process towards independence is making steady progress thanks to the efforts not only of the people of East Timor, but also of the international community and the United Nations, particularly of Mr. Vieira de Mello and his entire UNTAET team. Obviously, UNTAET and the East Timorese will be required to make further efforts in order to successfully achieve independence in May next year. But the progress made so far provides all the parties concerned with a solid basis on which to plan for the future.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">The efforts of the East Timorese themselves are crucially important for their nation-building in the post-independence period. After all, it is the people of East Timor themselves who are responsible for their future.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">A clear sense of ownership on the part of a recipient is also essential in order to make foreign assistance truly effective for the development of the country concerned. It is evident that independent East Timor will continue to need international assistance. The donors' meeting on East Timor scheduled to be held in Oslo in December will be important in this context. The Government of Japan is ready to play a substantial role in ensuring that the meeting is productive.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">But that meeting is just one, albeit important, step in the long and difficult process of nation-building that the future Government and the people of East Timor will have to pursue in the coming years. With this recognition, I would like to conclude my statement by assuring the people of East Timor that the Government of Japan will remain a partner as they tackle the challenging but rewarding task of nation-building.</p>

	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Australia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dauth</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by joining others in thanking you most sincerely, Mr. President, for the honour you do us in coming to preside over this very important meeting today. Thank you indeed for that. Let me also, at the outset, applaud Ireland's skilful handling of the Security Council presidency this month. It has really been a very impressive performance. It is fitting that Ireland, as a strong and consistent supporter of East Timor's peaceful transition to a stable, democratic and effective and independent State, is presiding over the Council at this important point in East Timor's transition process.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">You have asked us to be brief, Mr. President. I cannot promise that mine will be as entertaining as some of the interventions this morning, but I can promise to be brief.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">I want to begin, obviously, like so many others, by thanking Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello for his lucid and comprehensive briefing this morning. I extend Australia's continuing thanks to him personally, and to all of the members of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), for their dedication to establishing a solid foundation for the future of East Timor. I associate myself with my French and Portuguese colleagues in saying that Sergio Vieira de Mello is an emblem of the sort of United Nations that has just won the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">I also acknowledge with pleasure the presence of Chief Minister Mari Alkatiri and other elected members of the East Timor Second Transitional Government. Their presence here today is vital to an effective and honest appraisal of the progress that has been made in the transition so far and of the priorities and challenges that lie ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">Today the Security Council has an opportunity to send an unequivocal signal to the people of East Timor and to the international community of its continuing commitment to a successful transition process in East Timor. It is Australia's firm view that this signal should take the form of a clear endorsement by the Council of the recommendations set out by the Secretary-General in his most recent report.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">In that report, which we fully endorse, the Secretary-General has set out all of the elements required for an effective, timely and smooth planning process for the remainder of East Timor's transition. He has presented us with a carefully considered, moderate and responsible plan for a phased downsizing process. We hope that this will lead to a stable, democratic State in East Timor, with the meeting of long-term development needs assisted by United Nations agencies and other donor assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">There is no question that an adequate international military and civilian police presence will be vital to East Timor's successful transition. Australia supports the Secretary-General's detailed recommendations for these two components -- a military and civilian police presence. No less important will be an effective civilian presence.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">We concur strongly with the Secretary-General's view that a core component of civilian functions will be vital for a period after independence if the future East Timor administration is to survive and to function effectively. We acknowledge the extensive work undertaken by UNTAET and other agencies, including the United Nations Development Programme, to thoroughly examine the options available to fund this civilian component. We have taken close note of the limitations and risks which attach to an over-reliance on voluntary and bilateral funding options. We strongly support the use of assessed funding for the core functions which are identified by the Secretary-General as essential to the stability and functioning of government, but for which local expertise does not yet exist.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">It is Australia's unequivocal view that endorsement of the Secretary-General's recommendations is necessary to enable timely and effective planning for the future United Nations role in East Timor. Unless there is a clear endorsement, we risk unnecessary ambiguity and delays. It would be far preferable for concrete decisions to be taken early to protect the United Nations already substantial investment in East Timor. The Council's endorsement of the Secretary-General's recommendations will set out for the United Nations the resources that will be available for its use in the post-independence period. It will also confirm the needs that must be met by other players. This will create the best possible chance for a smooth and seamless transition to the post-independence period. Moreover, in East Timor, the Security Council has an opportunity to give the United Nations the time it needs to plan effectively for the transition process. It must not let this opportunity pass by.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">None of us want to see an open-ended United Nations presence in East Timor. Nevertheless, as the Council itself has said recently, there must be no exit without strategy. Accordingly, the Council has a responsibility to ensure that the prospect of a successful transition is not jeopardized by a precipitate downsizing of the United Nations presence in any of the core areas outlined by the Secretary-General, or by inadequate resources and unreliable funding for a post-independence United Nations mission.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">Through continued careful management, and by taking the right decisions at the right time, the Security Council has the capacity to ensure the successful completion of the United Nations mandate in East Timor, and the establishment of the sort of political and security environment we have all worked so hard to achieve.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Thailand. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kasemsarn</span> <span class="nation">Thailand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Allow me first to pay tribute to you and Ireland, Mr. President, for your presidency of the Security Council this month. I join others in thanking and commending Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his views on the developments and challenges that lie ahead in East Timor. I also welcome Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Chief Minister of the Second Transitional Government of East Timor, whose presence speaks volumes for the development and progress achieved in that land. I also wish to express our appreciation for the useful briefings given by the representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">There is no doubt that the United Nations, through its United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, has effectively performed its tasks as mandated by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1272 (1999)</a>. This has been well reflected in the peaceful elections for the Constituent Assembly on 30 August this year, which marked a milestone in East Timor's transition to independence.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">The people of East Timor and UNTAET deserve enormous credit for their remarkable achievements, especially in the light of the harrowing destruction two years ago. We also welcome the formation of an all-East Timorese Council of Ministers to oversee the public administration of East Timor. It is with them that the will of the East Timorese resides in shaping a self-governing and independent East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">We are heartened by the positive political, economic and social developments in East Timor highlighted in the Secretary-General's report. We fully support his recommendations on the successor mission to UNTAET, in which he envisages that a post-independence United Nations presence will be required in East Timor for a period of at least two years. Thailand voices its support for this proposal, not because it is one of the major troop contributors to the Mission, but because of our cognizance of the need for the continued engagement of the international community in securing a solid foundation for the future of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">Despite the enormous strides, the emerging of East Timor as a nation-State still needs the unwavering support and cooperation of the international community. Let us not be hasty in withdrawing our attention and responsibility from East Timor upon its attainment of independence. UNTAET's tasks, which are to establish a national civil administration, assist in the development of civil and social services and support capacity-building for self-government, among others, as laid out in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1272 (1999)</a> are far from being completed. They will not have been completed at the time of independence, as has been recognized by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">The Thai delegation has emphasised on many occasions, and reiterates today, that the support of the United Nations and the international community in capacity-building is of the utmost priority for the East Timorese to attain self-sustenance in the political, economic, social and cultural development of the country. It is therefore imperative that we assist in every way possible in equipping the East Timorese with necessary skills and capabilities for democratic self-government and nation-building. In this respect, we support the Secretary-General's proposal that the core tasks of UNTAET's successor mission should be funded by assessed contributions and supplemented by bilateral or multilateral arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">We cannot stress enough that a premature withdrawal of UNTAET, especially the peacekeeping force, would undermine the remarkable contributions and substantial investments of the international community in East Timor. Thailand thus believes that only a clear exit strategy with a solid development framework conducive to East Timor's self-sustenance would prevent the disintegration of the progress achieved to date.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">From our regional perspective, we recognize that only a strong and stable East Timor will contribute to the political and economic viability of the region. We in the region are doing all we can within our limited resources and capabilities to support the efforts of the United Nations and the international community in East Timor. It will take considerable time for East Timor to be a viable State with effective institutions of administration. Thus it is pivotal that the international community support a successor mission to UNTAET in East Timor for as long as necessary, at least until it has reached a certain level of sustainable development. Thailand, for its part, has offered to assist in the areas of agricultural, public health and technical expertise.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">Thailand's support for the establishment of peace and stability in East Timor, in our continuous contribution of military and civilian police personnel since UNTAET's inception two years ago, has been acknowledged by the international community. Our troops are not only engaged in safeguarding the territory, but are also playing a significant role in the rehabilitation of East Timorese through civil-military activities. A number of subsistence projects and non-military training, particularly in agriculture, have been initiated with the aim of fostering capacity-building for the population at the grass-roots level.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">The Royal Thai Government, despite its limited resources, intends to continue this dual role, and is prepared to maintain one battalion of troops in UNTAET's successor mission. We believe our contribution will play a part and make it possible for East Timor to become self-sufficient and thus ensure a peaceful future for its people.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Manalo</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">We join others in congratulating you, Mr. Minister, on your country's presidency of the Security Council for this month. The presidency of the Council under the Irish delegation has provided strong and enlightened leadership during these critical times.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">We also thank the Secretary-General, for his latest report on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), and Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Chief Minister and head of the Second Transitional Government of East Timor, for their very important statements this morning. We also wish to thank the representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for their briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">There is great excitement and anticipation concerning the future of East Timor. Much has been accomplished since we embarked over two years ago to support East Timor's independence and the formation of a viable and self-sustaining sovereign country. Indeed, the Philippine delegation associates itself with those who believe that the first real attempt by the United Nations at nation-building is on the verge of becoming a true success story.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">The previous two months have demonstrated definitive and concrete steps towards the goal of independence for East Timor at the earliest possible time. These include the election of a Constituent Assembly, held on 30 August; the 90-day process to draft the country's Constitution, which began in earnest after the election; the formation of an all-East Timorese Council of Ministers; and, lastly, just a few days ago, the inauguration of an East Timor Defence Force.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">The contribution of those involved in this process deserves our thanks and recognition. But no one deserves more credit than the East Timorese themselves for their courage and determination in the face of tremendous challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">It is in this spirit that my delegation urges the Security Council to ensure that the gains we have achieved thus far, and intend to achieve in the future, shall be preserved and promoted by a well-conceived, credible and adequate post-independence United Nations presence in East Timor. While attaining independence is no mean feat, it cannot be the final chapter of the United Nations exit strategy for East Timor. The commitment of the United Nations to East Timor over the past two years or so set the stage for East Timorese independence. However, the East Timorese deserve our continued support.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">The challenges ahead for East Timor remain daunting, as the country strives to achieve stability and development through the establishment of sustainable democratic institutions and economic structures.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">As stated in the report of the Secretary-General, the security situation in East Timor is also of deep concern. Therefore, until the envisaged East Timor Defence Force becomes fully functional, the United Nations should ensure that a robust United Nations military presence remains in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The Philippine delegation believes that the gains the East Timorese people have achieved so far should not be imperilled by a precipitate withdrawal of adequate international support and of an adequate international presence in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">The Philippines supports the recommendations of the Secretary-General on the establishment of the United Nations successor mission. We agree with his assessment that the primary focus of the successor mission will be to ensure the security of East Timor and the viability, stability and sustainability of its government structures, allowing for the completion of the mandate entrusted to UNTAET. Bearing this in mind, we believe the recommendations of the Secretary-General present a credible and balanced approach for helping East Timor establish effective institutions and an effective administrative capacity. We urge the Security Council to adopt these recommendations and establish the successor mission in East Timor with the appropriate number of military, police and civilian personnel until such time as the situation there has become stable and self-sustaining. At the same time, we look forward to receiving the Secretary-General's recommendations on the financial implications and the necessary financial requirements for the successor mission to UNTAET. In this regard, it is important that the successor mission receives assured and assessed funding to ensure that its activities can be sustained.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa11">Finally, the Philippines will continue to support United Nations efforts during the critical post-independence period of East Timor.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Naidu</span> <span class="nation">Fiji</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">May we commend you personally, Mr. Minister, for your presence here and your office for coordinating this open discussion on East Timor under your presidency of the Security Council. This topic is of great significance not only for my country, but also for the integrity of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">Before I proceed further, my delegation wishes to commend Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello for his continued contribution to the people of East Timor. We also welcome Chief Minister Mari Alkatiri among us today.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">As the Council knows, Fiji makes a modest contribution to the operation, with 194 military personnel maintaining peacekeeping duties along the East Timor border -- and I am pleased to say that our troops serve with Irish troops as well as with New Zealand troops. Our intervention today is therefore based on our own observations in the field and on the report of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">East Timor is truly a success story for the United Nations, being the shortest peacekeeping engagement to have substantially achieved its mandate. Contrast that with the more protracted operations which have continued for years, but for which a peaceful resolution has remained elusive.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">The Secretary-General's latest report, on developments in East Timor over the past four months, is very promising and provides a realistic road map for ultimately achieving independence. Implicit in that report is the continuing need for peacekeeping.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">The successful outcome of the August elections is encouraging. We hail in particular the fact that women occupy 28 per cent of the Constituent Assembly, which positively reflects upon the results of the women, peace and security strategy of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</a>. The result is a significant step forward in East Timor's nation-building, in coming out of a conflict situation and along the difficult path of transition to political independence.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">We would be pleased to see consensus reached on the issue of maintaining a troop presence in East Timor for a number of reasons. Most importantly, the new-found peace in East Timor has yet to consolidate. It will most likely flounder in a withdrawal that lacks a strategy -- more so as there are still outstanding issues under negotiation between the parties, including law enforcement, capacity-building of the police and security forces and developing the basic infrastructure that is vital for full autonomy.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa08">Although declining, the continuing militia activities pose some security and human rights concerns that must be addressed for the protection and safety of the population, both local and international. There is a need, therefore, for the continued presence of peacekeepers. Besides, much work remains to be accomplished in facilitating the return of thousands of refugees who are still in the Indonesian territories. This will also safeguard our credibility in the long term and make the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) an efficient and strategic operation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa09">Much irreparable loss and waste befell East Timor prior to the peacekeeping engagement. United Nations resources have now been channelled to this democratization and peace-building exercise in its two years of operation. We reiterate that a premature withdrawal would expose East Timor to likely violence and armed conflict. This situation would undo the progress made and squander the substantial investment of the international community; and it is therefore to be avoided at all costs.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa10">After going through such trauma, UNTAET has given the people of East Timor a feeling of security and hope in building new lives with some sense of purpose, hope for the future, enabling them to invest now for the benefit of generations to come. The least that the United Nations can do under the prevailing circumstances, having come thus far, is to provide them security and confidence with the presence of peacekeepers until the new Government has developed the capacity to fend for itself.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa11">Beyond this issue, the Secretary-General's assessment of the essential build-up work on the ground is well appreciated by my delegation. It also recognizes that a peaceful and composed environment is critical for the anticipated framework to succeed, which we all understand will happen only through peace-building and peacekeeping. We agree that the downsizing and phasing out of the peacekeeping force need to be based on the development of infrastructure and institutions. In this regard, we endorse the Secretary-General's entire set of recommendations for the successor mission and its core functions to be supplanted by the fledgling East Timor Government two years following independence.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fonseca</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">It is a great honour to see you, Mr. President, presiding over the Security Council. This is a clear sign of the commitment of Ireland to the cause of peace and security in the world. Allow me to pay tribute to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Sergio Vieira de Mello, whose hard work and wisdom in preparing East Timor for independence deserves the praise of the whole international community. I would like to thank him for his comprehensive briefing, as well as to echo his words this morning concerning the need to ensure an exit with strategy in East Timor so as to avoid a premature and destabilizing withdrawal.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Brazil welcomes the presence among us of Chief Minister Mari Alkatiri, the first elected East Timorese official to address this Council.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">The work of Sergio Vieira de Mello and his team has been made easier thanks to the vision of leaders such as Mari Alkatiri, Xanana Gusmão and José Ramos-Horta. But, above all, the progress achieved so far would not have been possible without the active involvement of the heroic East Timorese people, whose resolve to achieve self-determination we have all learned to admire. They have given us lessons in democracy and tolerance.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">Let me also thank the representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme for their important statements.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">It is appropriate to recall once more <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1338(2001).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1338 (2001)</a> of 31 January 2001, by which the Council stressed the need for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence. Indeed, we agree with a number of delegations that have highlighted the Secretary-General's view regarding the essential requirement in East Timor, which is to ensure that the enormous sacrifices of the East Timorese, the investments of the international community and the cooperation of the parties to bring about a successful transition are not squandered for lack of international support for the new State.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">We must ensure a smooth transition to independence, one that preserves stability, security as well as continuity in the Public Administration. For that to happen, we cannot rely solely on voluntary contributions. It is necessary to secure a predictable source of funding, as rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General. I am particularly pleased to note that the consultations of the Security Council have led to the text of a draft presidential statement that does not shy away from endorsing the recommendations put forward by the Secretary-General in the report under consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">We have witnessed important progress in the implementation of UNTAET's mandate over the last six months. The election for the Constituent Assembly was a huge success that bodes well for the future of party politics and democracy in East Timor. The Constituent Assembly has begun its deliberations and the all-East Timorese Council of Ministers has been sworn in. Strides have been made in the Timorization of the Public Administration.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">All these positive aspects notwithstanding, it is clear that there remain important deficiencies that must be addressed with the continued support of the international community. The security situation is now stable, but it is advisable to remain vigilant regarding potential threats, especially in light of reports of intimidation and disinformation campaigns in refugee camps located in West Timor. Regarding the refugees, it is good news that there has been an increase in the number of repatriations. This is also a sign that the efforts of Xanana Gusmão with a view to healing the wounds of past animosity are starting to bear fruit.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">We look forward to the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and Indonesia concerning security arrangements in order to allow international agencies, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to return to West Timor. Brazil appreciates the efforts of the new Indonesian Government to solve pending issues and to build strong bilateral ties with East Timor based on friendship and mutual respect.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">Another critical area for the future of East Timor is the strengthening of the rule of law. This is a precondition not only to realizing human rights, but also to providing a solid basis for the functioning of a sound economic system.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">In the field of criminal justice, East Timor still faces a dearth of judges, prosecutors, lawyers, investigators, forensic experts and interpreters. We have taken note with appreciation of Mr. Vieira de Mello's remarks on the efforts of his office to address the problems facing the Serious Crimes Unit. It is also important to address other legal problems that might inhibit economic recovery and development, particularly the need for clear and stable legislation on property rights, as well as a commercial code.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">As independence approaches and the downsizing of the mission in East Timor is carried out, an important source of hard currency will certainly start to dry up. In this context, it becomes even more important to continue to put in place income-generating projects to minimize the adverse impact of the decrease in United Nations personnel and expenditure. In addition, it is essential to keep the current level of public services after independence. The deterioration of such services, which include health and education, would hurt the most vulnerable and could constitute a blow to public confidence in the future State.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa13">The independence of East Timor should not be seen as the only objective of our efforts. It is for sure a fundamental step, a precondition for a better life for all East Timorese, but it should not be an excuse for precipitous withdrawal. It must be an opportunity to display a real commitment to a stable and democratic East Timor. The Security Council should act with determination to guarantee the stability of the transition through a strong successor mission, as proposed by the Secretary-General, and the international community as a whole must continue to provide generous support for the rehabilitation, reconstruction and development of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa14">The international community has undertaken the commitment to help East Timor to build a solid democracy. If we want to do justice to the sacrifice of the East Timorese people, we must go beyond the mere rhetoric of support. It is true that a mission with a mandate as broad as UNTAET's requires a huge investment, but anyone who is familiar with the complexity of building democracy and helping a people to stand on its own knows that such goods do not come cheap.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa15">Now it is time to protect the huge investment we have made. We cannot afford to put at risk the progress achieved. We hope that the Security Council and other organs of the United Nations will continue to attach high priority to East Timor. This will require matching our words of support with meaningful decisions and actions.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ouch</span> <span class="nation">Cambodia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank you, Sir, for convening this open meeting, enabling us to express our opinion in connection with the Council's consideration of the East Timor issue. My thanks go as well to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello; to Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Chief Minister of the Second Transitional Government of East Timor; and to the representatives of the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme for their comprehensive briefings.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">I would also express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General for his detailed and comprehensive report on East Timor, in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-983.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/983</a> of 18 October 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">Since the open debate of the Security Council on the situation in East Timor in July, remarkable progress has been made as regards the three crucial steps, as mentioned in the report, towards the accession to independence of East Timor. On behalf of my delegation, I would like to take this opportunity to express our high appreciation to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for his competent leadership and the United Nations staff for their dedication in accelerating the process of Timorization.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">Mr. Vieira de Mello made his mark during the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, in which he successfully led the repatriation of more than 360,000 refugees into Cambodia, thus enabling them to enjoy national reconciliation and integration and to participate in the elections of May 1993. Today, these former refugees have been fully integrated into Cambodian society and enjoy -- together with their brothers and sisters who stayed in Cambodia during the forcible isolation of the country in the 1980s -- the return to peace and stability and the beginning of sustainable development. As a country that experienced war and conflict for many decades before stability returned in 1998, Cambodia expresses its appreciation to the people of East Timor, who are now moving forwarded speedily to draft their own Constitution, which is a giant step towards independence.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">Although the process of Timorization seem to be going smoothly, I would like to stress that several conditions must be met to ensure a stable and prosperous independent East Timor. In particular, good relations with Indonesia are key to the future survival of East Timor, as the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) cannot stay on permanently. The new Government of Indonesia, under the presidency of Megawati Soekarnoputri, is democratic and open to reform, and she has demonstrated its determination to solve the Timor problem as soon as possible. In this connection, I believe that the meeting on 12 September this year in Jakarta between the President of Indonesia and the East Timorese delegation made a significant step forward in strengthening neighbourly relations and good cooperation between the two countries.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">In view of its tragic past and its recent achievements in bringing about peace and stability, Cambodia's unique experience is an important case study for East Timor's future. A post-conflict country like Cambodia or East Timor could be regarded as a sick person who needs to be treated with drugs, and sometimes with surgery. In order to prevent an eventual relapse, regular exercise and a lifestyle conducive to good health are essential for building up resistance to illness. This means that with the granting of independence to East Timor, the international community should support capacity-building, rehabilitation, reconstruction of the infrastructure and reconciliation. Above all, economic and social development should be given priority, so that stability and peace prevail in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">In order for East Timor to achieve its objectives, we strongly need to maintain, and expand into a new era of, partnership with the international community, which has provided extremely valuable support, both financial and technical. During the UNTAET period, East Timor has been fortunate in having the entire United Nations family and international financial institutions, including the World Bank, to help it in achieving these goals. It is important for this partnership to continue on equal terms after East Timor's independence. In this connection, my delegation strongly supports the observations and recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">East Timor should also be aware of the role of civil society, which can contribute a great deal towards the goals of post-conflict development and growth. An important component of civil society is the private sector. In the case of Cambodia, the country has placed much emphasis on attracting private investment and has instituted one of the most liberal foreign investment laws of the region. Private investment is coming mostly from neighbouring countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which are more intrepid in entering post-conflict countries like Cambodia and East Timor. We hope that we will soon be able to count East Timor in our midst as a new and vibrant member of ASEAN, which can significantly accelerate its economic and social development. I wish East Timor every success in its valiant efforts to build a new and modern country.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sun</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">Let me begin by thanking you, Mr. Minister, for presiding over this important open debate on East Timor. I would also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello for his cogent briefings every few months. My special welcome goes to Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Chief Minister of the Second Transitional Government of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">It is encouraging to hear that the independence process has been carried out smoothly during this critical year for East Timor. The historic elections for the Constituent Assembly were conducted in a peaceful, free and fair manner. The new Council of Ministers, whose head is with us today, is managing governmental affairs on its own, under the guidance of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). We are also satisfied to note that each time we receive the Secretary-General's report more progress has been achieved in the fields of economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">When it comes to the refugee problem, which in our view is of the foremost importance among innumerable issues to be addressed in East Timor, it is highly encouraging to hear that refugee returns began to increase considerably after the August elections, and the largest number of returns per month was realized in October, as Mr. Vieira de Mello explained this morning. We are concerned, however, that a large number of refugees still remain in Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">Furthermore, the Secretary-General has assessed in his report that hard-line militias will continue to pose a potential threat to East Timor even after independence. This security threat will be one of the factors determining the size and duration of the future presence of peacekeeping forces. Therefore, we encourage all the related efforts between the United Nations and the Indonesian government, including the Memorandum of Understanding, which is currently being negotiated. We hope that this thorny issue will be thoroughly resolved as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">The peacekeeping operation in East Timor was a truly daunting task for the United Nations when UNTAET was established just two years ago as a multifaceted and highly complex mission. We have come a long way and have achieved a great deal, making East Timor one of the greatest success stories in the history of United Nations peacekeeping operations. To ensure that this success is not fleeting and that our substantial investment is not squandered, we have already agreed on the need for a reduced but substantial international presence in East Timor after independence.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">Under these circumstances, restructuring the mission in East Timor is a very difficult task that requires delicacy and a sense of balance. Continuing increases in the whole peacekeeping budget and upcoming challenges to be tackled by the United Nations may be restrictive factors. From the point of view of management, it will not be easy to accurately judge the appropriate size of the mission, while everyone acknowledges the importance of an exit strategy during and after peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">In this regard, my delegation appreciates the complicated and laborious work done by the Secretariat and UNTAET in consultation with the East Timorese people and other international actors. We are also highly appreciative of the close consultations maintained by the Secretariat with troop-contributing countries during the past months.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">We fully support the proposed size and scope of the military, police and civilian components during the transition to the successor mission, in light of the justifications for each area, as detailed in the report. We also support the restructured form of the successor mission during the beginning phase of independence, as it will be essential to ensure the security and viability of the newly independent State.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">Regarding the future downsizing of the post-UNTAET mission after independence, we note that the Secretary-General will continue to assess the situation, as stated in paragraph 61 of his report. We expect in that regard that at an appropriate time next year the Secretary-General will provide us with viable recommendations on the further downsizing of the mission, based on developments on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa10">Now, we are eagerly looking forward to the establishment of a new State, although its official declaration will come some months later than initially expected. To ensure the long-term stability and sustainability of an independent East Timor, the continued support of other bilateral and multilateral actors is required. In that regard, we highly appreciate the efforts of the Indonesian Government in such areas as the political, military, humanitarian and human rights spheres, especially since the inauguration of President Megawati Soekarnoputri.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa11">Hoping that the international community will render greater attention and cooperation to the fledgling State, let me conclude by expressing my Government's continued commitment to East Timor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01"> The next speaker is the representative of Malaysia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hasmy</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">Allow me to commend you, Mr. Minister, for convening this important open meeting on the situation in East Timor. We are pleased to see you presiding over the meeting. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-983.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/983</a>) and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, for his extremely useful briefing. We are also pleased to see the Chief Minister of the Second Transitional Government of East Timor, Mr. Mari Alkatiri, in the Council today and were pleased to listen to his briefing. His views are most pertinent to the deliberations of the Council. We are grateful for the briefings given by the representatives of the World Bank and of the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">Like other countries in the region, Malaysia warmly applauded the manner in which the people of East Timor conducted themselves in the Constituent Assembly elections on 30 August 2001 and their full acceptance of the outcome. We welcomed the outcome of the elections and the formation of the 88-member Constituent Assembly. We also welcomed the appointment of Mr. Mari Alkatiri as the first Chief Minister of East Timor and the appointment of the members of his Cabinet. We are particularly pleased to see that a rather high proportion -- some 20 per cent -- of the Cabinet is made up of women ministers. That is indeed an impressive record for any country. We hope it will be maintained, or even improved, in the post-independence Cabinet as an exemplary model for all countries. We look forward to early and, it is hoped, equally impressive appointments in respect of the remaining two vacant portfolios.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">The United Nations too has come a long way since 30 August 1999. The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) deserves the plaudits of the international community for the way the elections were planned, organized and conducted. East Timor is now entering the last stage of the process of transition towards independence. Hence the importance of the current report that is being considered by the Council. The decisions that the Council will make on the basis of the report will to a large extent determine the kind of independent nation that emerges in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">As described by the Secretary-General in his message to the people of East Timor on the first anniversary of the popular consultation, the involvement of the United Nations with the East Timor independence process was one of the greatest challenges and responsibilities ever entrusted to the Organization. Having invested heavily in East Timor, it is only natural for the United Nations to wish to ensure that its investment will not be squandered, as the Secretary-General put it. For that purpose, it is essential to ensure that an independent East Timor will be a viable member of the community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">In that regard, the friends of East Timor would wish to ensure that, following independence, the United Nations does not leave East Timor prematurely or in a precipitous fashion. We are assured, and we are gratified, that that will not be the case and that there will be a substantial United Nations presence in the country. The continued presence of the United Nations beyond the completion of the political transition is important to ensure the smooth implementation of the arduous process of nation-building. For that purpose, it is essential for the international community to continue to support UNTAET through adequate and assured funding by the United Nations so that progress achieved so far will be sustained and further strengthened. In that regard, Malaysia looks forward to Council approval of the Secretary-General's recommendations contained in section IV of his report.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">The envisaged integrated successor mission to UNTAET, to be developed in consultation with the people of East Timor, would enable the United Nations to complete the mandate of Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1272 (1999)</a>. This would provide the institutions that are being built in East Timor, especially the civil service, with sufficient time to be further consolidated and strengthened. This intervening period is essential for the East Timorese people to acquire the necessary skills and experience, especially in the core functions in which local expertise is lacking, to ensure a functioning and effective governmental machinery in the post-United-Nations period. The international community should be pleased with the Timorization process that is taking place under UNTAET, which demonstrates the eagerness and determination of the people of East Timor to assume responsibility for their affairs and their preparedness to take charge of their own destiny. The action of the Council today and in the future should reflect the desires of the people of East Timor and the reality on the ground, and should take into account the view of the Secretary-General that operational responsibilities must be devolved to the East Timorese authorities as soon as that is feasible.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">The process of nation-building and reconciliation is a highly complex and sensitive matter. This is particularly true for East Timor in the context of its traumatic past. As a country that has stressed the importance of reconciliation among the people of East Timor as an indispensable ingredient of peace and stability, we welcome most warmly the establishment of the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation. We particularly welcome the fact that the Commission will seek to establish the truth about all relevant events that occurred in East Timor as far back as 25 April 1974. That decision is a clear demonstration of the non-selective approach that will guide the work of the Commission; it will go a long way in the reconciliation process. We hope that the even-handed approach of the Commission will contribute constructively to the promotion of tolerance, unity and harmony among the people of East Timor so that they will be able, at long last, to put history behind them, look forward to the future and, together, forge a strong, cohesive and united nation. We believe that the return of refugees, in particular the return of members of pro-integration groups and separated children, is an important element in the nation-building process.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa08">At the same time, the formation of a sustainable democratic State will require a higher level of maturity by the people of East Timor than they have shown so far during the election process. The sophistication and wisdom with which they handle difficult and sensitive issues will reflect the kind of nation that will evolve in East Timor in the post-independence period. Something that will put the East Timorese leaders to the test in that regard is the manner in which the issue of the rights of minority populations, including the minority Muslim population, is handled by the Constituent Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa09">On the issue of East Timor's economy, the Secretary-General has highlighted in his report the heavy reliance of that economy on external factors. The dramatic decrease in international personnel and expertise, and the possible decrease in resources, at least in the initial period, will have to be appropriately factored into the planning for the post-independence period. Particular attention should be paid to the building up of expertise in those areas where local expertise is most lacking, especially in the financial sector, as highlighted by the Secretary-General. Since this is a long-term issue, this question will have to be seriously addressed by both UNTAET and the United Nations successor mission.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa10">Malaysia welcomes the decision of the Constituent Assembly to recommend to UNTAET the date of 20 May 2002 for the handing over of sovereignty to the people of East Timor. Of course, this is a matter for the Council to decide in consultation with the people of East Timor. As a regional neighbour, Malaysia will play its part in assisting the people of East Timor to prepare for nationhood, within its capacity to do so. In the security area, Malaysia has seconded two senior military personnel to the East Timor Defence Force. In the area of diplomacy, a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also been made available, under UNDP's sponsorship, as an adviser to the newly established Department of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa11">Training has also been given in various areas of human resources development, including archiving, fire-fighting, policing and diplomacy, to 74 East Timorese, through the Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme. Currently, under the same Programme, 11 East Timorese are undergoing training courses in nursing and archiving in Malaysia. In addition, we have contributed $60,000 for the reconstruction of the Bacau mosque.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa12">Additional areas of assistance and cooperation between Malaysia and East Timor are also being explored. To expedite this process, a Malaysian liaison office was established in Dili in April 2001. Clearly, in the post-independence period, the people of East Timor will face many challenges of nation-building, in which their many friends in the region and beyond can play a constructive role.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa13">In conclusion, Malaysia believes that the invaluable experience gained by UNTAET in East Timor should be properly documented, and valuable lessons drawn from it as a model of a successful peacekeeping mission. In our view, one of the most important lessons to be drawn is the need for the active involvement of the countries in the region, as is the case with UNTAET. The importance of regional involvement is premised on the following considerations: knowledge of the country; shared cultural values, customs and language; and an abiding interest in ensuring regional stability. The success of UNTAET can be attributed to, inter alia, these factors, and I am sure that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General would be among the first to acknowledge that.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa14">It is hoped that the United Nations successor mission will be able to strengthen the regional dimension, perhaps in a more pronounced way, as East Timor begins to be more and more integrated into the region. In this regard, we warmly welcome the cordial and constructive contacts between the leaders of East Timor and its immediate and important neighbour, Indonesia, which augur well for the regional integration process.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">The significance of this meeting today is not lost on us: this is the first open debate of the Security Council on the situation in East Timor to be held since the historic elections for East Timor's Constituent Assembly, on 30 August this year, and the formation of the second interim government.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">Indeed, we are bearing witness to the opening of a new chapter in East Timor's transition to independence. In this context, Indonesia, as a country that shares a border with East Timor, has consistently demonstrated, in word and in deed, its strong commitment to working with the international community in a spirit of consensus, amity and cooperation, to create an atmosphere conducive to the establishment of a free, democratic and prosperous East Timorese society. It is therefore imperative that all concerned parties not indulge in negative perceptions and divisive practices, which could hamper attainment of the objectives we are all attempting to achieve for the people of East Timor. Within this context, there can be no better way of extending assistance and support to the people of East Timor than by working with them in partnership and focusing on the future development of the country and, indeed, the region as a whole. We believe that there is great potential in paving the way for such a mutually beneficial bilateral relationship.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">The remarks that President Megawati Soekarnoputri made during her State address before the Indonesian parliament, on 16 August, the eve of the anniversary of Indonesia's independence day, reflected Indonesia's commitment. The President unequivocally stated,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk02-pa05">"We have disentangled the question of East Timor in 1999 and honestly respected the choice of our brothers and sisters in the region to have their own state".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">The strengthening of bilateral relations between our two countries is viewed as a matter of priority in the realization of the vision of East Timor as a viable, peaceful and democratic country. Thus, my Government extended an invitation to the East Timorese leaders, including Mr. Xanana Gusmão, Mr. Mari Alkatiri and Mr. José Ramos-Horta, and to Mr. Vieira de Mello, who visited Indonesia on 12 October 2001. The cordial discussions at the meeting that resulted were a further step towards this new chapter of bilateral relations for Indonesia and East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">As a result of an initiative by my Government, we are looking forward to holding a high-level bilateral meeting in the near future to work on ways to resolve outstanding issues and, at the same time, to establish a sound and solid basis for future relations. It is in that same spirit that regional partnerships should be forged to achieve those noble objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">Yet another development in the relationship between Indonesia and the emerging independent State of East Timor was the conclusion of a bilateral agreement between the officials of the two sides last weekend in Atambua, concerning the demilitarization of their respective borders, thereby facilitating free and open visits by the Indonesian and East Timorese peoples. We believe that this will entail the withdrawal of foreign troops currently deployed at the borders as part of the United Nations peacekeeping force.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">We are fully cognizant of the undeniable reality that political independence is closely linked with the promotion of sustainable development. Bearing this in mind, the international community should become truly engaged in this process to ensure that the people of a nascent nation can reap the benefits of development by enjoying a higher standard of living. This can be realized only through the sustained assistance of the international community, through forging various forms of cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa10">The role of the United Nations on the eve of East Timor's independence must be viewed not only within the framework of the larger picture of assisting the East Timorese as they move towards peace, security and sustainable development, but also within the context of resolving the outstanding issues. The useful role of the Organization notwithstanding, it will ultimately be the East Timorese people themselves who should decide their own future.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa11">As far as Indonesia is concerned, it has left no stone unturned in fulfilling its commitments. This has included working with the relevant international humanitarian agencies to repatriate refugees and amending the law to expand the jurisdiction of the ad hoc human rights tribunal, as well as other relevant issues, such as pensions, education and security at borders.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa12">Especially on the issue of pensions, members of the Council will no doubt be aware of the Indonesian Government's long-standing readiness to disburse payments to pensioners who are former Indonesian civil servants, military and police from East Timor during the transition period. Technical arrangements for the disbursement have been agreed between Indonesia and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), and their implementation awaits follow-up from UNTAET. In addition, in a major policy development, my Government has decided to contribute to a special fund established to provide payments in lieu of Indonesian Government pensions to eligible former civil servants, military personnel, police and pensioners after independence. This special fund is one of the main components of the consolidated joint Government of Indonesia/United Nations appeal and global plan for the handling of the East Timorese refugees in Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa13">Although the recommendations of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator assessment team failed to reflect the prevailing realities on the ground, my Government is continuing negotiations with the Office of the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations system's operational activities for development in Indonesia -- in its capacity as the designated official for security in Indonesia for all United Nations agencies -- on technical arrangements in Jakarta as a basis for the return of United Nations agencies to East Nusa Tenggara. It is hoped that the refugees can return at the earliest possible time, particularly as we owe it to them as a people to uphold their human rights and dignity. We urge the international community to provide encouragement and support to the ongoing process of organized and ad hoc repatriation of refugees to East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa14">No one organization can claim complete credit for a humanitarian undertaking of this magnitude; and if credit is to be rightly accorded, it should go to the tireless efforts of those individuals on the ground, including the officials of the provincial Government of East Nusa Tenggara and the Regional Military Commander, for doing their utmost to bring closure to the refugee issue, since this is a priority of my Government. We were therefore pleased at the recent repatriation of 600 refugees on 27 October 2001, which was witnessed by Indonesian Government officials, East Timorese leaders and the representatives of UNTAET. The spirit of harmony and amity was evident in the remarks of Mr. Ramos-Horta, who upon welcoming them said, "This is your country. The door is open to all of you who two years ago took refuge from East Timor and are now willing to return"; while the Indonesian Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare, Mr. Yusuf Kalla, stated, "We wish that all refugees who return home will have better lives and continue to keep good relations as our brothers and sisters."</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa15">In conclusion, as East Timor grows into a full-fledged sovereign and independent nation, the international community has a solemn responsibility to support measures including building bridges of understanding towards achieving reconciliation, strengthening the foundations of government based on democratic and transparent practices, and promoting capacity-building programmes. No doubt the road that lies ahead abounds with challenges and obstacles. But we must be vigilant and ensure that our assistance does not overshadow the true efforts of the East Timorese to fulfil their legitimate needs and the goals that they have set for themselves as they realize their full potential as a people to carry out this nation-building process. It is to this end that we should extend our unstinting support.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Brunei Darussalam. I invite him to take a seat at the Council Table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Serbini</span> <span class="nation">Brunei</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">At the outset, we would like to congratulate you, Mr. Minister, for providing leadership to this meeting, and we thank the Security Council for allowing us to participate in the discussion of an issue that concerns us in the region. We would like to congratulate Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his team for their commendable work. The Government of Brunei Darussalam would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his excellent report on the work of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). We are very happy to see the participation of Chief Minister Mari Alkatiri in these discussions, and Brunei Darussalam looks forward to welcoming East Timor as a member of the international community in May of next year.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">Brunei Darussalam supports the role of UNTAET and is pleased with the way UNTAET has discharged its mandate. We are seeing continued significant progress after the election in East Timor. The presence of UNTAET has greatly contributed to the continuous peace and stability in the country. This is highlighted in the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">Having said that, we feel that we still have a long way to go to make East Timor a viable State. Its basic requirements were made clear in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1272 (1999)</a> and subsequent related Council resolutions, as well as in the Secretary-General's current report. Within this context, we fully support the interventions by those who spoke before us calling for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">As highlighted in the report, there are still a few areas in which East Timor needs assistance. In view of this, we feel that the continued presence of the United Nations is essential. We also note that support is still needed in building the East Timorese capacity for self-government, despite the great improvement in this area. Other areas in public administration, particularly civil administration, continue to rely heavily on services provided by UNTAET. We feel that the United Nations should continue its support in this area, which also includes development and training in the area of information and communication technology.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">We also note the shortcomings facing the newly formed justice system. It will be supported by the nascent East Timor Police Service and East Timor Defence Force, but maintaining law and order in East Timor would not be easy.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">In conclusion, I would like to re-emphasize the importance of building on the progress that we have achieved so far and, hence, of the continued international presence in East Timor. This is to ensure the country's successful transition into the international community. At the same time, we have to ensure continued consultation and cooperation with the people of East Timor in order to carry out UNTAET's mandate in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1272 (1999)</a>.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">The next speaker on my list is the representative of Papua New Guinea. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Donigi</span> <span class="nation">Papua New Guinea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">First, I should like to pay tribute to the presidency of Ireland for this month and to you, Mr. Minister, for travelling to preside over this special and public session of the Security Council on the question of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">I should like also to welcome to this special meeting Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Transitional Administrator of East Timor, and Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Chief Minister of East Timor. I appreciated the briefings they gave this morning, which were very helpful. I appreciated also the briefings by the representative of the World Bank and the representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">Papua New Guinea welcomes the election of the Constituent Assembly as well as the efforts being made to draw up a new Constitution and the establishment of new constitutional institutions. For East Timor to be a democratic country, it must have, among other things, freedom of speech coupled with a free press and media institutions. We note the admission of an East Timor journalist to membership of the Pacific Islands News Association at a recent Association meeting, held in Madang, Papua New Guinea, about two weeks ago.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">Papua New Guinea continues to do what it can to help in the process of establishing good governance institutions in East Timor. Recently, Papua New Guinea welcomed a visit by representatives of East Timor to study our Ombudsman Commission facilities and to obtain information from our Attorney General's department. That visit was facilitated by UNDP.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">We note that one of the constitutional law consultants to East Timor was also a consultant to Papua New Guinea's Constituent Assembly some 28 years ago.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">We believe that we have a living Constitution, and our Government institutions are not afraid to defend their role and independence, as guaranteed by the Constitution. We have also not been afraid of changing our Constitution to suit particular political developments or to meet changing value systems in our country. As a developing country, we are limited as to the type of assistance we can offer to East Timor, but that does not mean that we cannot share our development experiences with East Timor. We remain prepared to continue to share with East Timor our own particular experiences. Admittedly, not all of them have been good, but we hope that East Timor will be able to learn from them and to avoid the pitfalls that we have encountered.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">Papua New Guinea believes that any transfer of the funding of United Nations activities in East Timor to a special trust account for East Timor based on voluntary contributions is tantamount to abandoning the Territory. We believe that, at this special time, when terrorism is uppermost in our minds, it is imperative that the citizens of East Timor be guaranteed the right to live in peace within secure borders. That guarantee can be provided only by maintaining the presence of United Nations peacekeepers in that Territory.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">Papua New Guinea therefore supports the view that the United Nations should not unnecessarily scale down its contribution to the development efforts of the Government of East Timor following independence next year. In this regard, we thank the Secretary-General for his report contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-983.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/983</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">There is no better comparison here than that of an infant who is learning to walk. East Timor is on the verge of graduating from being an infant, but the international community must continue to walk beside it for some years, until the country has reached full maturity. It has held its elections for the constituent Assembly. We are grateful that the elections were peaceful and were conducted in a democratic and transparent manner. East Timor still requires expertise to run the Government as well as to provide advice when needed. It requires expertise in the areas of law and order, health, education, agriculture and infrastructure development, among many others. Simply put, Papua New Guinea is not yet fully satisfied that the institutions of Government in East Timor have been fully developed and staffed with appropriate personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">This fact is reflected in the report of the Secretary-General, in which he states that:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg023-bk02-pa11">"Much remains to be done to transform the bureaucracy into a viable, sustainable national administration run by East Timorese civil servants, with strong policy, regulatory and operational frameworks". <i>(S/2001/983, para. 11)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">He also rightly pointed out that the lowering of the Government's service standards could be a source of likely friction in future.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa13">Papua New Guinea therefore supports the recommendations contained in section IV of the Secretary-General's report. We also agree with his statement in paragraph 85 of the report that any plans for a successor mission to UNTAET in East Timor must contain "the core tasks that are crucial to protecting the progress made to date".</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa14">We believe that the United Nations must continue to address integral human development issues based on a solid and assured foundation of human security. In order to achieve this, it will be essential for the international community to continue to fund all core tasks of a successor mission to UNTAET. In our view, therefore, it would be premature for the United Nations to leave the country to its own devices after the granting of independence next year.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. MacKay</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">New Zealand welcomes the opportunity to address the Council as it considers the Secretary-General's proposals and recommendations for a post-independence United Nations presence in East Timor. I would like to compliment you, Sir, on Ireland's presiding over the Council and to express our strong appreciation for the Secretary-General's report on East Timor, introduced this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">There could be no more compelling arguments for why the United Nations must finish the job it has started than those put forward by Mr. Alkatiri on behalf of the people of East Timor, the world's newest democracy. Great progress has been made during the past two years to help East Timor prepare for statehood, with the date for independence now set for 20 May next year. These are indeed impressive achievements, and we should celebrate them as a reflection of the commitment and determination of the people of East Timor working in partnership with the United Nations community. New Zealand, for its part, congratulates the people of East Timor and those who have assisted their progress.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">New Zealand is in excellent company in voicing our strong support for an ongoing United Nations role in East Timor after independence. It is a particular pleasure to be able to speak in support of Mr. Alkatiri and the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. There have been many eloquent presentations today, and I intend to speak plainly and briefly about New Zealand's position.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">New Zealand clearly and unequivocally endorses the Secretary-General's report on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and all of its recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">We consider the recommendations for an UNTAET successor mission comprising military, police and civilian components as a logical and necessary next step in fulfilling the mandate agreed by the Security Council and detailed in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1272 (1999)</a>. We consider it essential that the core military, police and civilian components of the United Nations successor mission be funded from assessed peacekeeping contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Establishment of an effective government administration, as mandated under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1272 (1999)</a>, is as integral to the maintenance of East Timor's future security as the development of an effective military and police force. Assessed contributions funding from the peacekeeping budget, in our view, is not only necessary but is clearly justified. On the civilian side, the further contributions sought by the Secretary-General are minimal compared to the overall investment of the United Nations in East Timor, but are essential to securing that investment.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">The scale of the downsizing proposed is significant, but it is appropriate and realistic. We would certainly caution against seeking to trim the numbers further or to speed up the timetable. The Secretary-General's rigorous but flexible approach provides for further adjustments on the basis of developments on the ground, and we support this.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">New Zealand has contributed to the United Nations effort in East Timor since the preparations for the popular consultation in 1999, and we can verify first-hand the conclusions of the Secretary-General's report. It is a careful and measured assessment of need based on the advice and experiences of the East Timorese and those who have witnessed and contributed to progress made. We have spoken before of the need to provide assurance to the people of East Timor and to maintain necessary levels of support at this crucial time at which progress should be consolidated. These are critical points for us as a regional neighbour -- and those other regional neighbours that have also spoken -- and also as a troop contributor and Member State of the United Nations, as well as for the new nation of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">Funding the successor mission from assessed peacekeeping contributions will provide financial security for core functions identified by the Secretary-General in ongoing consultation with the Constituent Assembly, donors, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme. It will also provide assurance to the people of East Timor and to the international community of the collective political will to complete the job mandated in 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">Two years ago, the Security Council set out a vision for assisting East Timor to become a secure and viable independent State. The Secretary-General's report confirms how far East Timor has come. His recommendations set out the road map by which the Security Council's vision and mandate will be fully and finally achieved. We urge the Council to endorse the Secretary-General's report and recommendations in unequivocal terms.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">Today's debate provides an opportunity to reaffirm the United Nations strong commitment to international security and stability. The pursuit of these goals forms the core of the United Nations -- its inception, its Charter and the obligations inherent in membership of this Organization. We encourage the Security Council to take this opportunity to celebrate the successes of UNTAET and provide a strong message about its commitment to East Timor.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dos Santos</span> <span class="nation">Mozambique</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset to welcome Chief Minister Mari Alkatiri of East Timor, and his delegation. I thank him for the comprehensive statement he delivered this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">We thank you, Mr. President, for your presence and for convening this open meeting to debate such an important issue and for affording us the opportunity to participate.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">I wish to take this opportunity to once again express our profound appreciation to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, for their relentless effort and dedication to ensure a smooth, historic transition in East Timor. The progress achieved in the implementation of the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) has paved the way for the crucial developments that will lead to the independence of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">The elections for the Constituent Assembly on 30 August 2001, the drafting of the first Constitution of East Timor and the formation of an all-East Timorese Council of Ministers are indeed irreversible steps towards the long-awaited independence of East Timor. The orderly conduct of and high turnout for the elections are a further testimony to the political maturity that the people of East Timor have demonstrated throughout their quest for self-determination and the establishment of their own State.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">We would like to commend the Secretary-General's report on UNTAET for its clarity and comprehensiveness in planning for an international presence in East Timor after independence. UNTAET's mandate from the Security Council to establish a national civil administration, assist in the development of civil and social services and support capacity-building for self-government in East Timor is not yet complete. We therefore support the Secretary-General's recommendation for the establishment of a successor mission to UNTAET with the main task of ensuring security in East Timor and the viability and stability of its government structures as a step towards the completion of the mandate entrusted to UNTAET by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">The presence of the United Nations after independence in East Timor must be commensurate with the task before it. It is therefore imperative that all plans for the downsizing of UNTAET and its successor mission in East Timor in its military, police and civilian components take into account the prevailing security conditions and the needs of the new East Timorese administration. The main criterion that must guide a Security Council decision on downsizing or withdrawing the United Nations presence in East Timor or in any other peacekeeping operation is the successful completion of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">A crucial aspect of ensuring the success of the UNTAET mandate in East Timor is the availability of financial resources. The presence of the United Nations in East Timor after its independence must continue to be adequately funded from assessed contributions in order to ensure its sustainability. As the Secretary-General says in his report, voluntary or bilaterally funded arrangements are not reliable because "such resources may arrive late, or not at all, as donor priorities change and new demands arise". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2001-983.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/983</a>, para. 74</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">The people of East Timor have made many sacrifices in a clear demonstration of their commitment to a legitimate aspiration to an independent East Timor. The international community has also shown its continued commitment to the cause of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">The Security Council must now ensure that all these sacrifices and investments are not undermined. The Security Council and the international community as a whole must now act decisively and demonstrate that they will not abandon the people of East Timor at such a crucial juncture.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa10">We also call on the international community to continue supporting East Timor after its independence as it builds its own sustainable system of governance. The provision of technical, financial and other forms of assistance will be crucial for East Timor to soon join the community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa11">The international community must now make available the necessary resources for the timely completion of the UNTAET mandate and lay the foundations for a future independent State of East Timor. Resources from assessed contributions must be made available at adequate levels, and UNTAET and its successor mission must be allowed to use the resources in a more flexible manner as they prioritize and discharge the complex mandate in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa12">For its part, Mozambique will continue to make its modest contribution to UNTAET and to the people of East Timor. We look forward to celebrating on 20 May 2002 the independence of this sister nation.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa13">In conclusion, I once again express our profound gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and, through him, to the men and women of UNTAET for their commendable job in East Timor.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Navarrete</span> <span class="nation">Mexico</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">I wish to extend my delegation's thanks to you, Mr. Minister, for personally presiding over this open debate of the Security Council on the day that Ireland is ending its successful presidency of the Council for this month, during which your country has demonstrated its commitment to transparency in the work of this body.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">Being, it seems, the last speaker in a long list of speakers, I shall be as brief as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">The events in East Timor in the last two years, and in particular those since the elections held on 30 August this year, attest to the positive effects that concerted action can have when the goal is the consolidation of peace. Mexico supports the concerted efforts of the United Nations with the representatives of the Transitional Government, headed by Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Chief Minister of the Second Transitional Government, whose presence at this debate we welcome.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">My country shares the idea expressed in this debate by, among others, the representatives of the Philippines and Brazil, that no one deserves more recognition than the people of East Timor for their bravery and determination in the face of formidable challenges. We likewise express our gratitude for the constructive position assumed by the new Government of Indonesia, for we are convinced that political dialogue between the principal players has proved to be an essential element in the progress that has been made. We hope that the channels of communication and cooperation between the authorities of Indonesia and East Timor will be strengthened.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">The presence in the Chamber of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, who has distinguished himself by his excellent work as Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), reflects the importance the Organization has attached to the question of this emerging nation.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">We express our support for the recommendations of the Secretary-General in his report for the period from 25 July to 15 October 2001, which is before the Council. We support in particular the recommendations regarding the successor mission and, as almost every participant in this debate has done, those concerning the period after independence. We believe that it is essential to maintain the United Nations presence in order to consolidate the progress made, as well as to be able to respond to the needs of the Timorese people and to be in a position to carry out a smooth and seamless transition in the post-independence phase. The real challenge will be to maintain the conditions necessary for lasting peace and the establishment of an environment conducive to East Timor's sustainable development. We think it necessary for the Security Council to continue to carry out a periodic review of the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">We support the plan to establish an integrated peacekeeping mission under the leadership of a special representative of the Secretary-General in order to guarantee the security of East Timor and the viability and stability of its governmental structures. The military, civilian and civilian police components will be crucial to a gradual assumption of responsibility by the authorities of East Timor within an overall framework of effective administration of the territory.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">We call on the international community to support these efforts by making timely payment of their assessments to the Special Account for UNTAET. Those resources are necessary for UNTAET to be able to fulfil fully the mandate given to it by the Security Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1272 (1999)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1338(2001).pdf" class="pdf">1338 (2001)</a>. In this context, the future participation of the international financial institutions, the funds and programmes of the United Nations and, of course, bilateral donors will be essential.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vieira de Mello</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">Let me thank you, Mr. President, and all today's speakers, for the kind words addressed to my East Timorese colleagues, to the staff of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and to myself.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">May I also express our gratitude -- the gratitude of Timorese and internationals alike -- for the strong support expressed by all the members and non-members who took the floor today for the set of recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report, particularly with regard to the post-UNTAET/post-independence phase, with a view to consolidating the achievements of the Transitional Administration. Your endorsement -- hopefully through a presidential statement -- of the need for the United Nations to remain fully committed through a predictable and dependable source of funding for the post-independence requirements of East Timor -- which perhaps more than any other country will be the child of the United Nations and of this Council -- will send a powerful, reassuring message to the people and to the Second Transitional Government, which has a huge challenge before it in the months ahead, as well as to the Constituent Assembly of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">We have taken note, with great care, of your advice and comments, which we shall keep very much in mind in the weeks and months to come. I also note with satisfaction that no specific questions or particular concerns were expressed to us in the course of this debate, which is indeed very encouraging.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">We are extremely pleased that the Council is prepared to welcome the date of 20 May 2002 for the independence of East Timor. That will certainly further focus our minds and lead us to redouble our efforts in all the areas that were discussed here today in the run-up to independence.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">The Secretary-General will of course submit to the Council a sixth-monthly report in January next year, prior to the expiration of UNTAET's current mandate on 31 January. It will contain, as several speakers wished, an elaboration of the post-independence United Nations structure, as well as of the precise needs of the independent Government of East Timor, which could only be presented in a fairly preliminary fashion at this stage in the report before the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">Finally, may I thank the people and the Government of Ireland, yourself, Mr. Minister, and Permanent Representative Ryan and his colleagues, for your solidarity with the cause of East Timor and the role of the United Nations in that territory. Allow me, Minister Cowen, to express my particular thanks to you for crossing the Atlantic to preside over this meeting, and to attempt to do so in Gaelic, with apologies for my deficient pronunciation: <i>a Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha</i>.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">I do not really want to respond; I just want to offer some conclusions.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">We came to this meeting from very far with many preoccupations. The expectations of our people are increasingly great, and now we are faced with another type of expectation: the international community's expectations of us. But we think that the support we are receiving here will give us much more energy, creativity and, of course, strength to face all these challenges and expectations. Without the Council's support it will be very difficult for us to do it, but with this kind of sympathy and support surely the East Timorese people, their Government and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor will really make possible the impossible, and we will do our best to have a democratic country, a stable country and a peaceful country in that region.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa01">I believe we have had an extremely interesting debate on East Timor today at an important moment in its transition to independence. I am particularly pleased that Special Representative Vieira de Mello and Mr. Alkatiri, as well as Ms. Borges and Mr. de Araújo, were here to hear in person the strong messages of support for the continued involvement of the United Nations in that process. As Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland, a country with close links with East Timor, I feel privileged to have presided over such a positive meeting at the culmination of weeks of discussions and to deliver the presidential statement in the next meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa02">May I say also how appreciative I am to hear the compliments and the kind words that were directed to Ireland, to our delegation here, to our Permanent Representative, Richard Ryan, and to his staff for the way they have presided over the Security Council proceedings during the course of this month. We, too, are very proud of them. They have excelled themselves and have kept to the finest traditions of our public service. We are very grateful for the outstanding work that they have done during this month and, indeed, throughout our membership of this body. We look forward to continuing with that work, working with our colleagues to deal with the issues of the day.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa03">I am sure that we all appreciate the strong commitment of the Secretary-General to East Timor also, as has been continuously demonstrated, and the great support that there is for his report. We look forward to his ongoing personal involvement as a major factor in the success of this undertaking.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa04">There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk03-pa05">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
