</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martin</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01"> The Council is being asked to mandate a larger United Nations mission in Timor-Leste after successive downsizing -- from the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor to the United Nations Mission in East Timor to the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste and its previously proposed successor office. This might be seen as a reversion to an earlier stage of United Nations engagement with Timor-Leste, but I want to stress that that is not the case. Timor-Leste is today a sovereign State that struggled hard for its right to self-determination and its independence. Its second constitutional Government, headed by Prime Minister José Ramos-Horta, represents a political compromise forged by Timorese to manage the most serious crisis faced by the new State and to steer the country towards its first post-independence parliamentary and presidential elections.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The international support provided to the young institutions of Timor-Leste has achieved a great deal. Increasingly, it is being provided not only through the successive missions but by United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and by bilateral and multilateral donors. The proposals in the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) would not reverse that process. What they envisage is a more effectively coordinated partnership between Timor-Leste and the international community: a compact, which will be Timorese-led, to ensure that its Government's own programmes, funded by its growing budgetary resources, are complemented in the most helpful ways by international assistance and advice. The compact should ensure too that the international community, in providing that assistance and advice, does so in a context of coordination and complementarity, not one of confusion or competition among donors. Within the United Nations mission itself only a small group of civilian advisers would promote that coordination, principally in areas most crucial to the mission's key roles: the governance of the security sector, the administration of justice and the functioning of democratic institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Assisting and ensuring the credibility of the 2007 elections will be a central task for the new mission's first year. But we are by now well aware that even the most successful elections are only one element of building a democratic State. We are aware too that the time-scale for developing institutional capacity, especially in areas such as policing and the justice system, is a long one.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The central failure revealed by the recent crisis has been in the security sector, and the reconstitution of the police service of Timor-Leste is the core task requested and proposed for the new mission, together with executive international policing in the interim. Regrettably, the task is a substantial one, because the diagnosis undertaken by our assessment mission made clear the weakness of the police throughout the country, and not only in Dili, where it is so keenly felt by internally displaced families today. But it is a task that must also be seen in a wider context. A fundamental review of the whole security sector is required to clarify the roles of the defence force and the police in relation to each other, together with strengthened Ministries of the Interior and Defence, to ensure sound institutional development and civilian oversight.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The challenge to the justice system as it confronts serious crimes, old and new, is greater than ever. The role of both official institutions and non-governmental organizations to protect human rights needs further strengthening. Our proposals would ensure that international assistance to those key related tasks is coordinated in one pillar of the new mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">Timor-Leste's new Government, aided by the Church and civil society, is embarking upon the twin challenges of dialogue across political divisions and of community reconciliation, which must address societal tensions, in particular between those from the west and those from the east of the country. The new mission must be ready to support that process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The demand for accountability for those responsible for crimes committed in the course of the crisis, as part of the necessary basis for reconciliation, is a strong one. The crucial work of the Independent Special Commission of Inquiry will provide an objective starting point. Some have drawn a connection with the unfinished business of both justice and reconciliation for the serious crimes of 1999 and before. The proposals for the new mission incorporate a role in assisting with the implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General's separate report (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-580.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/580</a>) on justice and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">The moments when Timor-Leste is in the international spotlight are rare and fleeting. But in each of its discussions of the response of the United Nations to the recent crisis, members of the Council have been united in their willingness to assist the country at a time of difficulty. Today I urge the Council to send a strong message to the people of Timor-Leste that the renewed determination of the international community to stand by them will indeed be a sustained commitment, by supporting this and all other recommendations set out in the Secretary-General's report for a new mission -- which correspond, I believe, to the appeal of Timor-Leste's Government and people.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Martin for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than five minutes, in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate a text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">I shall now give the floor to members of the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Manongi</span> <span class="nation">Tanzania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">We thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for his briefing. We also wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. José Luis Guterres on his new appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, and we welcome him to the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The United Republic of Tanzania witnessed the agony of the people of Timor-Leste following the events of the past three months. Those regrettable events have also focused international attention on the urgent needs of Timor-Leste. What has become clearer through the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) and the briefing that we received this morning is that, even without those sad events, Timor-Leste's needs would be immense and challenging. The magnitude of the challenge is such that Timor-Leste cannot confront it alone.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">It is true that the people of Timor-Leste need committed friends and partners; but they also need the United Nations. This Organization, and especially the Security Council, can be proud of the way they have assisted the people of Timor-Leste on their march to self-determination and independence. It was a worthwhile investment.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">But if that invaluable investment is to make a lasting contribution to the growth and stability of Timor-Leste, the work aimed at supporting effective and credible security, administration and judicial institutions will have to be carried to its conclusion. We believe the United Nations has an important role in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">It was therefore with great relief that we took note of the letter (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-620.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/620</a>, annex) from the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, His Excellency José Ramos-Horta, informing us that the emergency facing his country is at an end. His appeal that it is now important to focus attention on the establishment of a new United Nations peacekeeping mission in Timor-Leste is, in our view, the most desirable way of providing Timor-Leste with the support of the international community and of preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Peacebuilding and the building of effective national institutions of governance and administration can be a daunting task. Nonetheless, it is one in which the United Nations has significant expertise, based on country-led and country-owned initiatives. In this regard, the future of Timor-Leste and its well-being very much depend on the support the international community can extend to it through the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">The assessment mission has established that this future will require the reconciliation of communities deeply divided by violence; the building of a truly national army and police force; the establishment of the rule of law, with a competent and impartial system of justice; the addressing of human rights abuses; and a focus on what could be the core of the problem: poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Obviously, this is a daunting job -- a complex responsibility that will require contributions of resources and expertise from the international community. However, the United Nations must play a central role in the support of Timor-Leste while urging individual Governments and regional and international organizations to do likewise. The Council can show the way. Moreover, the United Republic of Tanzania will support such a course of action.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Estremé</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">At the outset, I would like to welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Timor-Leste, Ambassador José Luis Guterres. We congratulate him on the assumption of his new post, and we wish him all the best in his future tasks. I would like to assure Mr. Guterres that Argentina will continue to support Timor-Leste as it strives to achieve its fullest potential, as we have done since 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">I would like to thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, Mr. Ian Martin, for his briefing, as well as for his efforts over recent months to resolve the crisis in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa03">The report of the Secretary-General, (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>), introduced by Mr. Martin, offers a comprehensive and precise account of the situation in Timor-Leste and contains detailed proposals on a United Nations future presence there with which my country, in general, agrees. Argentina fully supports the recommendations of the Secretary-General and endorses the establishment of a multidimensional integrated United Nations mission in Timor-Leste for the period of one year, with the mandate, concept of operations and structure proposed in the report.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa04">We welcome the fact that those recommendations adequately reflect the request made by the Dili Government, through Prime Minister Ramos-Horta in his letter of 4 August (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-620.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/620</a>, annex). The United Nations presence should fully respect the sovereignty of Timor-Leste and the specificities of that country. It is essential that the entire process be led by the Timorese people themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa05">The fact that we are considering the establishment of a new mission in Timor-Leste should not be interpreted to mean that earlier efforts failed. On the contrary, the achievements since 1999 were noteworthy. However, we have learned that peacebuilding and nation-building processes are long-term tasks. The international community has the responsibility not only to renew its commitment to Timor-Leste, but also to continue that commitment in the long term.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa06">The forthcoming months will be of the greatest importance for the consolidation of the Timorese institutions. The general elections to be held in 2007 will be the principal milestone in that process. The support of the United Nations will be essential if success is to be ensured.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa07">The justice sector and the police were two of the areas most affected during the recent crisis. For that reason, we believe that most of the international assistance efforts should focus on those areas.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa08">We warmly welcome the Secretary-General's report on justice and reconciliation (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-580.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/580</a>), requested by the Council in September 2005. Argentina supports the inclusion in the mandate of the new United Nations mission concrete provisions regarding the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report. We believe that the draft resolution to be considered by the Council in coming days should adequately reflect those aspects.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa09">We support all the efforts being made by Timor-Leste and Indonesia to achieve reconciliation. The Commission of Truth and Friendship could be a valuable mechanism in this regard. However, we believe that both Governments should make every effort to further strengthen the credibility of the Commission, in particular by reviewing the amnesty clause, in order to ensure that that mechanism conforms with international human rights standards.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa10">The events of April and May demonstrated that the security situation in Timor-Leste continues to be extremely fragile. We are pleased to note that the recommendations of the Secretary-General envisage the establishment of a mission comprising all the components necessary to face those complex security challenges.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa11">The emphasis of the new mission should be placed on the deployment of a robust police component to support the maintenance of internal law and order and to contribute to the training of the Timorese national police. Given that elections are scheduled for 2007, the continued presence of that component will be of the utmost importance. For that reason, we should consider its deployment for at least one year.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa12">I wish further to state that Argentina supports the Secretary-General's recommendation that the new mission include a small military capacity under United Nations command and control; we believe that the proposed numbers and mandate are appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa13">In retrospect, we can say that the Security Council's decision to accelerate the withdrawal of the previous peacekeeping operation in Timor-Leste was premature. Drawing from these lessons, the Council should speedily respond to Timor-Leste's current needs and should act on the basis of the recommendations of the Secretary-General. That would send a clear message of support to the people and the Government of Timor-Leste.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Emyr Jones Parry</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I should like to begin by aligning myself with the statement to be delivered later by the Permanent Representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">In welcoming our former colleague José Luis Guterres, I should like to congratulate him on his elevation to the post of Foreign Minister of Timor-Leste. Like others, we are grateful to Ian Martin for leading the assessment mission to Timor-Leste, and to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">We welcome the Secretary-General's proposal for a compact between Timor-Leste and the international community in order to reorient the existing national economic plan and coordinate the activities of the Government, the United Nations and other actors in building the capacity of State and Government institutions. A revised approach will be essential to address the political origin of the recent crisis. We therefore support the recommendation made by the assessment team for United Nations support during the elections, in order to reassure the population and the international community that the elections are free and fair. We can thus endorse the proposal for a mission to coordinate a comprehensive review of the security sector, assessing options for the development of both the defence force and the police service. That will be vital in achieving sustainable peace in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">We agree that the reconstitution of the police service of Timor-Leste is the core task. We therefore support the proposal for a temporary blue-hatted executive police force within the mission. That police component should be of an appropriate size. Following the recent crisis, police forces outside of Dili have continued to function reasonably well, so there should be no need to return to the levels of international police that were seen in 2001. It is important that a clear timetable be established for handing back executive functions to the police service and for a drawdown following next year's elections.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">As a bridging measure, we need the continued presence of an international stabilization force in the short term to provide support to the follow-on mission which we will be deploying, I hope, as a result of this discussion.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The Australians and others are making a valuable contribution on the ground. The national command structures allow them to respond flexibly to changes as they take place.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">Putting in place the force-generation mandate of a United Nations force would, in our view, inevitably be time-consuming and, in practice, unnecessary given the presence on the ground of the partners and the requirements for the interim. We welcome the coordinated efforts between partners on the ground involved in the international stabilization force and the United Nations mission. We favour its providing appropriate guarantees to the mission; but it should be left there.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">It is not clear to me that a United Nations military liaison office needs to be included in the mission to assist the Border Patrol Unit in the planning and conduct of border security operations. Border tensions seem no longer to be a source of instability in Timor-Leste, as evidenced by the absence of incidents during the recent crisis. Given that the initial focus of the mission will be on policing and security-sector reform, it will be important that the mission have strong leadership with an appropriate background in that area.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">The United Kingdom endorses the findings and the recommendation in the Secretary-General's report on justice and reconciliation. The follow-on mission should assist the Timorese authorities to ensure accountability for human rights abuses and redress for victims. We support the Secretary-General's intention to establish a human rights and transitional justice unit that would ensure effective follow-up to and implementation of the recommendations of the Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste and other transitional justice mechanisms, including the process relating to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR). The transition of all justice-sector actors currently working under the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) should go ahead, but I note of course that there are concerns regarding potential duplication with the United Nations Development Programme.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">Since both gender and youth issues have the potential to lead to future instability, it is important that gender and youth aspects be incorporated into the work of a follow-on mission.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa11">I would conclude by underlining the importance of a public information component in the new mission to avoid a repetition of the escalation of panic that occurred during the recent crisis, which was partly caused by rumour filling the void left by a lack of reliable information.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa12">In support of Ian Martin's concluding remarks, let me say that we all need the Security Council to send a signal of continuing commitment to Timor-Leste, a signal that that commitment will be sustained until the job of the international community is done.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">Despite all the caution engendered by the recent sad experience in Timor-Leste, my delegation wishes to note recent positive developments, seen in particular in the gradual return to peace and the swearing in of the new Government just a few days after the swearing in of Mr. José Ramos-Horta as Prime Minister. These positive developments are due to the sense of responsibility demonstrated by the authorities and the entire people of East Timor and to the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sukehiro Hasegawa, the entire staff of the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL), United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations -- without whom this progress would not have been made.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">We must also recall the decisive action by international forces deployed at the request of the Government of Timor-Leste and with the agreement of the international community, in particular those deployed by the Governments of Portugal, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Thanks to the common effort of the international community, Timor-Leste has been put back on track. Today, the main challenge that the Government and the people of Timor-Leste must face together is that of consolidating what has been achieved, sending strong signals in order to prevent a repetition of past errors. My delegation supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General to set up a new multidimensional, integrated United Nations peacekeeping mission in Timor-Leste. Indeed, the structure and mandate of the mission as proposed by the Secretary-General are consistent with the wishes of the expressed by the Government in its recent correspondence with the President of the Security Council. That is true also of the objectives of most of the proposals contained in the report of the Japanese Government mission, which was recently introduced by the representative of Japan and of which my delegation takes note.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">My delegation also expresses its support for the recommendations made by the Secretary-General in his report on justice and reconciliation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-580.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/580</a>) and for any other approach taken to provide the new United Nations mission with the resources it needs to accomplish its tasks in order to ensure a swift and methodical transfer of full responsibility for the conduct of national affairs to the Government and the people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">It is clear that the success of the mission to be established will depend not only on the resolve of the people who will lead it, but also on an assessment of past actions and the hoped-for results. In other words, while it is understood that the United Nations must help this new member of the international community take its first steps, not direct it, the United Nations -- and thus the Security Council -- still has the responsibility to avoid any obstacles that could arise in its path.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Therefore, with regard, for example, to the judicial proceedings against the perpetrators of crimes in Timor-Leste who are currently living in Indonesia, we should have discussions with the country's authorities to identify the best ways to combat impunity while respecting both international norms in that area and the sovereignty of every country.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">As for the security problems in Timor-Leste, which we know are a sensitive issue, my delegation earnestly hopes that consideration will be given to the proposal to gradually replace the international forces now on the ground with a strong presence of United Nations police supported by a military unit under United Nations command -- which in turn will be replaced eventually by the Timorese national police and army.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">We must not only take account of the experience acquired on the ground by the international forces, as has been said, but also better meet the expectations expressed by the Government of Timor-Leste by seeking consensus on the best way to ensure security in the run-up to the critical period of next year's elections -- a way that is in the interests of the Timorese people and that is agreed by all the parties concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, we believe it is important to stress that, in the context of the new United Nations mission, the importance of the security aspect should not obscure the need to combat the deep-seated causes of the crisis -- particularly unemployment and poverty, which affect a significant portion of the population, especially young people and women. Timor-Leste also needs schools and hospitals -- in short, social infrastructure. My delegation therefore supports any proposal to establish an international assistance programme, including through the initiative of a "compact" for Timor-Leste.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Liu Zhenmin</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The Chinese delegation would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) and Special Envoy Ian Martin for his briefing. We would also like to welcome His Excellency Mr. José Luis Guterres, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, who is here among us once again at this meeting. We wish to pay a special tribute to Mr. Sukehiro Hasegawa, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, who was unable to attend this meeting, and to the entire staff of the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) for continuing their work under extremely difficult conditions. We also express our appreciation and thanks to the military police from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal for helping to maintain order in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">It was with the assistance of the United Nations that Timor-Leste achieved independence and began the process of nation-building. People often refer to Timor-Leste as the child of the United Nations. The United Nations thus bears special responsibilities and obligations with regard to Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Over the past few months, the Security Council has been closely following the developments in Timor-Leste and has often held discussions and consultations about the situation, from which the Council has sought to draw lessons. The Council has also been working out appropriate decisions as to what actions should now be taken in Timor-Leste by the United Nations and the rest of the international community to help the country maintain stability and promote development so as to consolidate as much as possible the progress it has made since independence and nationhood and to prevent further reversals in the momentum of peacebuilding.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">In that context, the Chinese delegation believes that the Government, national leaders and other social and political forces in Timor-Leste should put their national interests first and engage in good-faith dialogue within the constitutional framework, seeking common ground and setting aside differences in order to create favourable conditions for next year's presidential and parliamentary elections. Here, the United Nations and the international community must play an active and constructive mediating role.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">Secondly, the United Nations and the international community must work out an effective long-term assistance plan for Timor-Leste. It must be said that for some time, while the success story of Timor-Leste was being enthusiastically told and retold, people easily overlooked the fact that the country had existed for only four years. In effect, it was starting from scratch in terms of human resources and institutional capacity-building and could not possibly stand on its own overnight. Therefore, China is in favour of sending a new multidimensional integrated mission to Timor-Leste and helping to establish a "compact" between Timor-Leste and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">Thirdly, with regard to the new mission's composition and mandate, we must configure the mission so that it will be able to address the root causes of the crisis. The views of the Government of Timor-Leste must also be fully respected and taken into account. In the short term, in order to improve and maintain security, it is imperative that we urgently address the potential danger of widespread weapons, help to reorganize the military and police sectors and rationalize their relationship, supporting the new mission by providing it with robust police functions and a small military component.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">Fourthly, the international community should continue to encourage and support Timor-Leste in developing long-term friendly relations with its neighbours. It is gratifying to note that two of its large neighbours have played a positive role in calming the unrest in Timor-Leste. We hope that the Truth and Friendship Commission will continue to work actively to achieve results at an early date and appropriately resolve the outstanding issues.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">As an Asian country, we are very concerned about the stability and development of Timor-Leste, but also about how the situation in the country might affect the South-East Asian region as a whole. During the turmoil, the Chinese medical team continued to carry out its duties and remained at its post. Our two Governments recently signed an agreement to send a second medical team to Timor-Leste. In the future, we will continue to provide assistance within our capacity and to play our part in helping to achieve stability and development in Timor-Leste.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Faaborg-Andersen</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Ian Martin, for his briefing. I would also like to welcome José Luis Guterres to the Security Council and to congratulate him on his assumption of the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Denmark fully associates itself with the statement to be made shortly by Finland on behalf of the European Union. I would only, at this stage, like to add a few points.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">The security situation in Timor-Leste has stabilized, thanks in large part to the troops provided by Australia, Portugal, Malaysia and New Zealand, and thanks to the recent reconciliation efforts and political progress. Nevertheless, Timor-Leste's security and political situation remains fragile and some of the key institutions, including the Timorese police, are no longer functioning. Significant international assistance is therefore required to bring the peacebuilding effort in Timor-Leste back on track, and we support the Secretary-General's idea of a Timor-Leste compact.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">It is clear that the future mission in Timor-Leste will need to be sufficiently large to effectively address such urgent issues as the need for a United Nations police force, training of the national police and support to ensure that next year's elections will be free and fair. There is also an urgent need for institutional support, particularly in the justice sector, the rapid implementation of quick-impact projects and sustainable economic development, in large part through assistance from traditional development agencies and bilateral donors. Despite the increase in the international presence, it is, at the same time, important that the Timorese remain in the driver's seat and that any advice and assistance be provided on a sustainable basis.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">We strongly support the Secretary-General's recommendations on the issues of human rights and justice and reconciliation, including the proposal for the mandate of the new mission to include assistance for the resumption of the investigative functions of the former Serious Crimes Unit. However, we believe that the international support and legitimacy provided to the bilateral Commission of Truth and Friendship should be conditioned on a revision of its amnesty clause. As mentioned by the Secretary-General, that clause is currently inconsistent with the requirements of international law, which bars amnesty for serious violations of international law. The new mission should support efforts that ensure that justice will prevail for past and future crimes, including those that took place earlier this year and led to the recent crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">Many challenges remain, including to address the root causes behind the recent violence. It is our hope that the future United Nations mission will allow Timor-Leste to establish sustainable institutions as well as sustainable peace and development.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Oshima</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Like others, I wish to thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ian Martin, for his briefing. I welcome the presence in this Chamber of our former colleague, Ambassador Guterres, and wish him well in the discharge of his new important duties as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">I wish to reiterate our appreciation to the four Governments -- Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Portugal -- for the contribution they are making with their security forces to the stabilization of Timor-Leste, as well as to the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) in Dili, led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hasegawa, for its contributions.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">We welcome the report of the Secretary-General with his recommendations on the shape and mission mandate for a post-UNOTIL United Nations presence in Timor-Leste in the aftermath of the recent turmoil in the country. We also commend the assessment task carried out by Mr. Martin of the political, security, social and economic situation in the country, which formed the basis for the conclusions of the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">The report of the Secretary-General concludes that the recent series of violent incidents were triggered by political conflict in the Government, which expanded and came to involve the security organs of the country and caused extensive displacement of innocent civilians. Significantly, the report noted that, while there have been some gains in certain areas, including the promotion of democratic institutions and governance since the independence of the country four years ago, the Government and society still face enormous challenges, such as, among other things, institution-building in the security sector and in the judicial field, establishment of the rule of law, fighting poverty, and dealing with the high degree of youth unemployment, which contributed to the crisis and aggravated it once it began.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">The Japanese Government, for its part, sent a mission to Timor-Leste following the turmoil and issued a report whose conclusions match in large measure the assessment and conclusions contained in the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">We believe that, in considering the appropriate shape, size and mandate of a successor mission to UNOTIL, it is important to fully take into account those conclusions and the assessment of the Secretary-General. In that context, we wish to emphasize a few points as particularly important.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">First, we consider that the basic assumptions of and the policy line followed by the Security Council in Timor-Leste for the past few years have proved in the main to be a correct approach. That policy is aimed at promoting, as much as possible, the independence, self-reliance and ownership of the Government and its people as much as possible; fostering the gradual transition from a peacekeeping to a peacebuilding mission, while taking local conditions fully into account; and encouraging broad-based partnership with various actors for sustainable development. We do not believe that the recent turmoil occurred because of the United Nations policy, which, in our view, helped the people of Timor-Leste to make important gains within a relatively short period of time, starting almost from scratch.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">However, that is not to say that what the United Nations has done in all its areas of involvement has been perfect. There were obvious shortcomings, and it is important to recognize them and learn lessons from the experience. For example, we believe that we could have prevented the recent outbreak of violence, or at least minimized its consequences, if we had been able to discern and promptly address the fragility of the political and security system of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Secondly, the Secretary-General's report underlines the importance of not trying to reverse, because of the recent internal disturbances, the transfer of responsibilities that has already taken place. The responsibilities have been gradually handed over to the Government of Timor-Leste, to United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and other development partners, as appropriate. That transition, the Secretary-General reports suggests, should continue to be encouraged. We fully endorse that notion, which we believe should inform, as an important guiding principle, the consideration of the follow-on United Nations mission.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">Thirdly, Japan fully supports the proposal of the Secretary-General to develop the idea of a compact and to promote the conclusion of such a compact between Timor-Leste and international development partners upon the initiative of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">We also believe that, in order to ensure the effective operation of a follow-on mission in Timor-Leste, and even to ensure optimal coordination and cooperation among key participants within the framework of such a compact, an appropriate mechanism, such as a policy consulting council, would need to be considered. The Japanese Government mission's report mentioned previously has made such a recommendation as a useful facilitation tool for effective coordination and cooperation among actors, which should include the United Nations, the Government of Timor-Leste and other international partners. We would like to encourage the United Nations to consult with the Government of Timor-Leste on such an idea at an appropriate time.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa12">UNOTIL's mandate will expire on 20 August, and the Council will need to agree on a draft resolution on a follow-on mission. The Core Group countries on Timor-Leste have been discussing elements of the draft resolution, drawing on the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa13">Japan, as the lead country on that issue in the Council, will continue to facilitate those discussions in the Core Group and to conduct consultations as well with the members of the Council, in order to proceed with the preparation of a draft resolution. Our aim is to work on the draft resolution with a view to its adoption by consensus by the end of this week.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa14">Currently, there appears to be a broad agreement of views on establishing a multidimensional mission, largely based on the Secretary-General's recommendations, including the police and civilian adviser components of the new mission. There is still some significant divergence of opinion on how to handle its military component. Some argue that it should remain under a bilateral arrangement, while others contend that it should be brought under the United Nations Blue Helmets.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa15">Japan's view is that, for the sake of ensuring operational effectiveness, it would be preferable to utilize, to the fullest extent possible, the international security forces that have been provided on a bilateral arrangement. Nevertheless, we will continue to facilitate discussions on the issue, aimed at arriving at an option that is agreeable to all the partners.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Duclos</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">France aligns itself with the statement that will be made by Finland on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">France would like to express its appreciation for the report of the Secretary-General and to thank Mr. Ian Martin, his Special Envoy, for the excellent work he has carried out on behalf of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Timor-Leste experienced violent security disturbances immediately following the withdrawal of the United Nations presence from its territory. Those disturbances led to the complete disintegration of the police force in Dili. Mr. Ian Martin has also informed us that the Timorese police has also been much weakened in the provinces and that Timorese society is more divided now than it was following independence.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">That bitter assessment leads us to the conclusion that there is a need for a long-term recommitment by the United Nations in Timor-Leste. In that respect, France supports the recommendation made by the Secretary-General in his report, which we believe to be consistent with what is needed in terms of the mandate and the composition of the mission, as well as with the requests that have been made by the Timorese Prime Minister, Mr. Ramos-Horta, in his letter dated 4 August.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">We are, of course, now prepared to draft and adopt a resolution. As the Ambassador of Japan pointed out, there are still some outstanding questions with regard to the form that an international military presence should take in Timor-Leste. I would like from the outset to express our gratitude for the action led by Portugal, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">We will adapt our proposal essentially in the light of the expectations of the Government of Timor-Leste itself. In that regard, I would like to say that we will not establish our final position until we have heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, Mr. José Luis Guterres, whose presence we welcome here.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Al-Nasser</span> <span class="nation">Qatar</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Allow me first of all to thank Mr. Ian Martin, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to Timor-Leste, for his praiseworthy efforts. We would also like to thank him for the important briefing he gave us this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">I would also like to welcome my friend, Mr. José Luis Guterres, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, who is here with us in the Council. I congratulate him on his appointment to his post and wish him every success.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Certainly, the circumstances facing Timor-Leste are extremely sensitive. The recent chaos in that country reflects the delicate nature of that explosive situation, given the worsened economic situation and the precariousness of resources, as well as the country's recently gained independence.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The deteriorating security situation and the generalized chaos demonstrate once again that Timor-Leste sorely needs the assistance of the international community. The crisis in that country is complicated; it involves political, historical, social, economic and institutional issues. The weakness of the political and Government institutions and the great disparity in the performance of several of those institutions led to an unleashing of the crisis. Moreover, the wounds of the past have not yet been healed, while unemployment among young people is rampant. All of this has led to a weakened security situation and chaos.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">The international response to the security crisis in Timor-Leste was positive and swift. We therefore extend our thanks to all those who sent forces to help stabilize the country at the request of the Timorese Government. The international community worked swiftly to respond to the need to stabilize the situation, provide economic assistance to Timor-Leste, increase investment and create increased opportunities for youth employment.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">We must continue to focus heavily on reform of the administrative, political and economic institutions and to give the country a healthy and solid new momentum. We therefore reaffirm the important role to be played by the United Nations in the important task of creating of a new mission to work side by side with the Timorese Government, provide advice and expertise in rebuilding Government institutions and establish long-term plans for building a modern State.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">In that respect, my delegation supports the recommendations set out in the report of the Secretary-General on the creation of a mission for a preliminary period of 12 months, until the results of the 2007 elections are known. Reports will be submitted periodically to the Security Council during that time to keep it abreast of the need for reducing or expanding the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">The international community has learned an important lesson in Timor-Leste with regard to newly independent countries. We must not abandon them in precarious or weakened political and economic situations. We hope that this experience will help us to get down to the serious work of helping Timor-Leste to overcome the crisis.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Churkin</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">We welcome the presence in the Chamber of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, Mr. José Luis Guterres. We thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ian Martin, for his report on the United Nations future role in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">We believe that the main conclusions and recommendations contained in the report are correct. We welcome the formation of a new Timorese Government headed by Mr. José Ramos-Horta and we take note of the measures adopted by the new leadership, aimed at stabilizing the situation in the country and enhancing dialogue with Timorese political movements and society. Thanks to those efforts, the situation has recently improved considerably. We note the important stabilizing role played by the international force made up of contingents from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Malaysia. We are grateful to the Governments of those countries for their rapid response to the request for assistance made by the Timorese authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">At the same time, it is clear that the situation in Timor-Leste remains fragile and that many problems facing the country are still far from being resolved. Of particular concern for the near future are the situation with regard to the disarming of former participants in the recent crisis and the still unresolved problem of the tens of thousands of internally displaced persons.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The recent crisis clearly showed the extent and complexity of the problems in Timor-Leste. Given its own continuing inadequate capacities, Timor-Leste requires long-term substantial external support. We support the recommendation of the Secretary-General to establish, for an initial period of 12 months, an integrated United Nations mission in Timor-Leste. It is important that the planned mission should include a strong police component to deal with the important task of supporting law and order in Timor-Leste and helping with the creation and strengthening of the national police force which has practically disintegrated.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">We agree that the civil-sector priorities of the future mission should be support for national reconciliation, support for the upcoming election process, assistance in the design and implementation of national socio-economic strategies and support in creating a justice system and other State structures.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">Given the diminished capacity of the Timorese armed forces and the clear request from the Timor-Leste authorities, we support the recommendation of the Secretary-General to include a small military capacity in the future mission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">With regard to the report of the Secretary-General on justice and reconciliation for Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-580.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/580</a>), we believe that the approach proposed in the report is the correct one, given the position of the interested States and the fact that the approach is aimed at strengthening Timor-Leste's capacity in the justice sector. We believe that the proposal of the Secretary-General with regard to the force's format and international composition is acceptable.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Vassilakis</span> <span class="nation">Greece</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">Let me start, Mr. President, by thanking you for organizing a very pertinent meeting on Timor-Leste following the critical situation the country experienced recently and with a view to a Security Council decision on a follow-up United Nations presence there. It is a particular pleasure for me to welcome amongst us Foreign Minister José Luis Gutteres. I would also like to thank Mr. Ian Martin, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, for his insightful briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">Greece fully aligns itself with the statement to be made later by Finland on behalf of the European Union. I would like, though, to make a few additional comments.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">We are pleased to note that the security situation has calmed down after the unfortunate violent incidents of recent months. Greece once more commends the immediate dispatch and deployment of defence and police forces by Portugal, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia in response to the relevant request by the President and the Government of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">At this juncture, we must not relax our vigilance. The recent crisis demonstrated how fragile the stability of that newly independent country is. In many ways, the crisis itself further weakened State institutions, such as the police. Clearly, the root causes underlying the recent crisis -- namely, youth unemployment and unhealed wounds of the past -- may yet reappear, so a robust international security presence is needed.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Having played a crucial role in the creation of Timor-Leste, the Security Council has, in our view, a moral obligation to sustain the viability of the country until such time as it can provide for its own security and development.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">As requested by Prime Minister Ramos-Horta, the new mission to succeed the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) should have a police force of considerable strength, backed by a small military force, under the command and control of the United Nations. That request is taken on board by the Secretary-General in his latest report (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">We cannot fail to agree. Bilateral arrangements to reinforce the internal security situation, though welcome in the short term, cannot be a viable long-term solution. The United Nations is in a unique position to help stabilize security in Timor-Leste, while at the same time providing aid for its economic development. There are already many United Nations agencies on the ground helping national authorities in various humanitarian and development aid programmes. What needs to be upgraded is the level and quality of security provided to them, in order for them to function in a stable environment. That can be done only by a new United Nations mission that has police and military components, as already suggested. In any case, we are talking about a relatively small force -- nothing of the proportions of those that have been dispatched to other parts of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">Such an arrangement would be in line with the respect we have expressed for Timorese ownership, would encourage the new Government of Prime Minister Ramos-Horta in its endeavours and would provide the necessary security umbrella for other United Nations and humanitarian actors in the field. It would thus underline the determination of the United Nations not to let a nation with teething problems go it alone.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa09">The presence of an upgraded, multidisciplinary, integrated new United Nations mission will also provide the necessary help for the reform of the police and the justice sector and would also serve to promote national political dialogue and reconciliation. It would also boost the sense of confidence of the Timorese people in view of the presidential and parliamentary elections to be held next year.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa10">In closing, allow me to recall that we have to learn from past experience. If we rushed to close down the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) -- as is the prevailing sense right now -- we have to be very careful and not hurry this time. Greece looks forward to working with the other members of the Council towards achieving consensus in formulating the most appropriate solution concerning the United Nations mission that will succeed UNOTIL.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Wolcott Sanders</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">We thank Mr. Martin for his presentation and would like to express our appreciation for his efforts to bring about reconciliation in Timor-Leste. We also welcome Foreign Minister Gutteres to today's proceedings.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">The recommendations of the Secretary-General take a comprehensive and detailed approach addressing the root causes of the crisis in Timor-Leste. The United States particularly appreciates the recommendation that United Nations advisors work closely with the Timorese Ministries of Defence and Interior to ensure that there is an integrated approach to the armed forces and police. That will be critical in building a democratic security sector.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">We remain unpersuaded that there is a need for United Nations troops. Security concerns in Timor-Leste are internal. The international force is in place, is well equipped and well staffed, and is prepared to respond if there should be any need for military action.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">The United States supports a strong United Nations police operation in Timor-Leste, engaged both in law enforcement and in training. That is a critical issue, both for security and to build a police force which respects the rule of law and is responsible to the elected Government. We note that credible policing is only one element in restoring tranquillity and creating an atmosphere in which people feel safe to return home. The social and political issues which underlie the violence must also be addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">We fully agree that there must be accountability for the crimes committed in Timor-Leste during the violence last spring. The United States appreciates the work being done by the Special Commission of Inquiry. We hope that the Special Commission will address both individual and institutional accountability, as well as factors contributing to the violence, including allegations of illegal arms distribution by former and current officials.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">We strongly support reactivation of the Serious Crimes Unit to complete investigation of the atrocities of 1999. The United Nations and the international community should also consider what assistance they might give to the judicial systems of Timor-Leste and Indonesia to bring to trial those arrested since the Special Panels for serious crimes were closed, or who may be brought to trial in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">The judicial and legal sectors in Timor-Leste need our support, and we urge Timor's partners to respond to that need. We support the Secretary-General's recommendation that reconciliation be a key element in responding to such crimes. Timor-Leste's own institutions should be the primary planners and implementers of reconciliation efforts, with the United Nations facilitating and lending its good offices.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">The critical work of the expert advisers placed in key ministries and offices of the Government must continue so that Timor-Leste's friends and partners can help the Government to develop the expertise it requires.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">Finally, the work of the electoral unit will be a vital element in assisting the Government and people of Timor-Leste to hold free, fair and transparent elections in 2007. The Electoral Assistance Division should lead that effort.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Tincopa</span> <span class="nation">Peru</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I wish to thank Mr. Ian Martin, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, for his briefing. We also welcome the presence in the Chamber of Minister for Foreign Affairs José Luis Guterres.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">Moreover, we wish to express our thanks for the reports of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Peru firmly supports the Government and people of Timor-Leste in their quest to ensure a State that will be peaceful and sustainable in the long term. In that regard, we would highlight the measures adopted in the past month to halt the violence and insecurity experienced by that country in May and June 2006. We welcome the appointments of Mr. José Ramos-Horta as Prime Minister and of other members of the cabinet on 10 July, creating an atmosphere of tranquillity and hope following a series of unfortunate events. We believe it essential for the Government and the various political forces to work on the basis of dialogue and reconciliation and with the support of the international community and, of course, of the United Nations in implementing defined objectives to ensure stability, development and security in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The Secretary-General's report pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1690(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1690 (2006)</a> provides a complete and objective assessment of the situation in Timor-Leste, along with specific recommendations for the establishment of an integrated and multidimensional United Nations mission. Peru supports many of those recommendations, among which I would highlight the following.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">We support the Secretary-General's proposal to deploy a maximum of 1,608 United Nations police personnel to Timor-Leste in the period leading up to, during and after the 2007 elections, and gradually to draw it down following the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">We support a small military component under the control and command of the United Nations with a maximum of 350 armed and unarmed troops of all ranks, to be concentrated in Dili, with the exception of unarmed liaison officer teams in the border districts, as described in paragraph 118 of the Secretary-General's report.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">We support the inclusion of the civilian component and its various mechanisms, including units for political affairs, elections, human rights and transitional justice, democratic governance, humanitarian affairs and gender, to mention but a few. We also support the joint operations and joint mission analysis centres.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">In brief, we would stress that Peru supports the strong and robust mandate for the new United Nations mission in Timor-Leste described in paragraph 110 of the Secretary-General's report. We would wish the elements and activities described therein to be included in the draft resolution to be adopted by the Council in the coming days.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">With regard to the civilian component, we would like to focus on the gender unit. Its relationship to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1325(2000).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1325 (2000)</a> on women and peace and security is essential in a country like Timor-Leste, where women need an opportunity to participate fully in all aspects of the promotion, maintenance and building of peace and where they need to be empowered in order to participate in the political decision-making and development of their country.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">We also believe it important to have a human rights and transitional justice unit to monitor the human rights situation and assist the Timorese authorities in ensuring that those who are responsible for violating human rights are punished and that victims will enjoy individual and collective redress.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">Along the same lines, we would refer to the Secretary-General's report on justice and reconciliation in Timor-Leste, in which emphasis is placed on recognizing the efforts undertaken by Indonesia and Timor-Leste in the area of truth and friendship. We believe, however, that it is important for both Governments to continue to strengthen the capacities of their respective judicial systems, in particular with respect to bringing to justice those responsible for serious violations of human rights committed in Timor-Leste in 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, I wish to underscore the importance of continuing to promote economic development in Timor-Leste and for income to reach those most in need. To a great extent, the long-term success of Timor-Leste will depend on the success of economic and social development. In that regard, I would point to the reference in the Secretary-General's report to a "compact" between Timor-Leste and the international community to reorient the existing national development plan in order to make it more effective and productive. If that challenge is to be met, it is essential for the Government and the national social actors of Timor-Leste to work together and responsibly in drafting policies and programmes to that end.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Matulay</span> <span class="nation">Slovakia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">Let me thank you, Sir, for calling this meeting and for giving us the opportunity to speak on this vital issue at a very critical juncture. We welcome the presence here of Mr. Guterres, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, to participate in this debate, and we thank Mr. Martin for his statement.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">Since the representative of Finland will make a statement on behalf of the European Union with which we associate ourselves, we will confine ourselves to making some supplementary remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">We share the concern of others over the incidents that have occurred in the past three months in Timor-Leste, and note with concern that the population is still suffering the consequences of violence and destruction that arose from them. We agree that the security situation in Timor-Leste has changed visibly, thanks to the presence of the international police and military forces from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal. It is necessary to emphasize that many of the elements that gave rise to the original crisis are merely dormant, while the crisis itself has created new potential sources of instability that add to the complexity of the situation, including the large number of missing firearms. The Secretary-General has duly noted that fact in his latest report.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">A new Government was sworn in a month ago. In the short term, it will have to deal with the instability and disgruntlement of various groups in society in the aftermath of a traumatic crisis. In the long-term, it will be confronted with the complex challenge of building a new nation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">The United Nations has achieved a great deal in Timor-Leste, but significant challenges remain in realizing long-term security and sustainable development. The emerging institutions in that country are still fragile. With the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections next year, Timor-Leste is rapidly approaching yet another crucial crossroads in its history. The elections will be of the utmost importance, although we agree with Mr. Martin that they are only one of the elements in building a successful democratic society. The elections will be important for the future stability and democratic development of Timor-Leste and must be conducted in a fair and free procedure. In that respect, we fully recognize the need for the continued involvement of the international community to help Timor-Leste to restore order and build a democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">A new international presence in Timor-Leste is needed to meet the changed circumstances. We support the establishment of a new, robust and complex United Nations mission in Timor-Leste. Its role would be to consolidate the gains that the United Nations has already achieved in the country, help the Timorese Government ensure political stability, support the 2007 presidential and parliamentary elections and maintain public security. It would also help Timor-Leste to rebuild its whole security sector and its economy, fight poverty and promote and protect human rights. At the same time, it is important to note that the Timorese Government and the Timorese people must assume full ownership and responsibility for the transformation process, with the continued support of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">As a final note, we also wish to underline that an important element of peacebuilding and peace consolidation in Timor-Leste includes fostering national reconciliation. Prime Minister Ramos-Horta and President Gusmão have both committed themselves to that goal, without sacrificing accountability for crimes committed during recent months. We note with satisfaction that the Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste has completed the first of two visits aimed at establishing the facts and circumstances surrounding the incidents of April and May, including their causes. We would also like to highlight the need for continued attention to the necessity for accountability for past human rights crimes in Timor-Leste.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Ghana.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">At the outset, let me welcome to the Council my friend and former colleague Ambassador José Luis Guterres, as well as to wish him well in his new assignment as the Foreign Minister of his country. Let me also reiterate our appreciation for the invaluable contributions of Special Representative Sukehiro Hasegawa and Special Envoy Ian Martin with regard to putting Timor-Leste back on track after the unfortunate disturbances of April 2006. They have not only highlighted the challenges facing the country, but have also provided very useful insights and suggestions concerning the way forward.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Among the priority areas deserving close attention are the consolidation of democratic institutions, electoral support, national reconciliation, law and order, the promotion and protection of human rights, humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation, poverty alleviation and the provision of basic services. Meeting those challenges effectively will require a combination of local initiative and international support, with the United Nations in the vanguard. More important, they also serve to remind us forcefully that six years are not enough to transform this newly independent country into a stable and prosperous democracy. As stated in the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>), nation-building and peacebuilding are long-term tasks. Therefore, in trying to prune down the partnership between the international community and Timor-Leste, with the aim of making it more focused, we must also be careful to strike the right balance, taking into account the vital lessons we have learned from the disturbances that broke out in Dili on 28 April 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">At the same time, we recognize that the support of the international community cannot be a substitute for the determination and commitment of the Government and the people of Timor-Leste to build a united, democratic and prosperous nation of their own. Therefore, we urge that maximum effort be exerted to develop local capacity as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">On the future role of the United Nations, we recognize that it is clearly well-placed to define and manage the role of the international community during Timor-Leste's transition into a more stable and capable State. We support the call for a robust United Nations police, military and civilian mission that would guarantee law and order pending the reorganization and restructuring of the Timorese police and armed forces in order to raise their level of professionalism.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">Obviously, no meaningful development can take place in a climate of lawlessness and impunity. On the other hand, there can be no lasting security where the basic needs of the people are not met. In Timor-Leste, as in other countries in similar circumstances, the link between poverty and insecurity cannot be denied. Nor is it easy to reconcile a society in which people find themselves scrambling for the little that is available. Inevitably, poverty tends to breed a privileged minority, and to reinforce a sense of discrimination among the most deprived. Consequently, in addition to security-sector reform and institutional capacity-building, the highest priority must be accorded to the delivery of basic services such as health, education, water and sanitation, as well as the creation of meaningful livelihood opportunities, especially for young people.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">In the short term, however, the humanitarian consequences of the recent disturbances must be urgently addressed, in order to prevent internally displaced persons from aggravating the discontent in society. Every able-bodied person must be actively and productively involved in the nation's development.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">Not only have recent events exposed the inadequacies of the governance structures of Timor-Leste; more important, they underscore the urgency of alleviating youth unemployment and its attendant poverty and deprivation. Consequently, the idea of a Timorese-led "compact" based on the national development plan should define the depth of engagement between the international community and Timor-Leste. Hopefully, next year's elections will serve as an opportunity for the people of Timor-Leste to begin afresh with renewed determination to forge ahead.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">I now resume my functions as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">I give the floor to Mr. José Luis Guterres, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guterres</span> <span class="nation">Timor-Leste</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">It is a great honour to see you, my dear friend Ambassador Nana Effah-Apenteng, presiding over the Security Council for this month. I wish you and your country, Ghana, every success during these very challenging times.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">Today I would like to share with the Council my Government's views on the role of the future United Nations presence and of international assistance in Timor-Leste beyond the completion of the mandate of the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL), on 20 August 2006. Let me start by reiterating, on behalf of the Timorese people, our gratitude to the troop-contributing countries -- Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal -- for having so promptly and efficiently re-established and maintained law and order and saved many Timorese lives. That intervention was made at the request of the President of the Republic, Mr. Xanana Gusmão; the President of the national Parliament, Mr. Francisco Lu'Olo Guterres; and the Prime Minister of the first constitutional Government, Mr. Mari Alkatiri.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">We welcome the report of Secretary-General Kofi Annan (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) and we commend the great contribution of Special Envoy Ian Martin and his team on the assessment mission. The report was the product of wide consultation in Timor-Leste. In that respect, we concur with its recommendations, which are in line with the spirit of the letters of President Xanana Gusmão and other key leaders calling for the establishment of a robust United Nations police, military and civilian mission to assist the people of Timor-Leste. That was followed by a letter (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-620.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/620</a>, annex) by Prime Minister Ramos-Horta dated 4 August 2006, to you, Mr. President, and to the Secretary-General calling for the establishment of a multidimensional and integrated peacekeeping mission, with a police force of considerable strength and a small military force under the command and control of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">The Secretary-General's report provides a good account and a sound analysis of the events that took place in April and May of this year. For the sake of brevity, I shall not elaborate any further in that regard. Those events revealed the institutional failures of the security forces and the fragility of democratic institutions. It also revealed an acute need for continued long-term international assistance in the building of viable State institutions, notably in the areas of security, justice and development.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">Cognizant of the fact that institutional failures in the Timorese national police (PNTL) and the Timorese armed forces (F-FDTL) are at the core of the recent crisis in Timor-Leste, a holistic approach to security-sector reform will be required. International advisory support is important in reviewing the future role and needs of the defence sector, including both the F-FDTL and the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">In the area of justice, the funds made available under the Justice System Programme of the United Nations Development Programme are not sufficient to cover the support needed for the Office of the Prosecutor-General, particularly in the light of the recent violent incidents and the expected increase in the number of cases that the national judicial system will have to handle. Also, a significant number of human rights officers are needed to support our national institutions, including the Office of the Provedor and the national Parliament, as well as civil society, in monitoring, promoting and protecting human rights and promoting justice and reconciliation. It is of vital importance that the international community remain engaged in fostering the genuine commitment to justice and human rights that exists in the Government, in civil society and among the Timorese people.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">At the same time, I wish to assure the members of the Security Council that the Government will expeditiously search for a solution to the grievances of the 594 petitioners by means of the recently invigorated national Commission of Investigation.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">I wish to express my Government's greatest appreciation for the work of the international Independent Special Commission of Inquiry, which is currently undertaking an investigation into the events of 28 and 29 April, 23 to 25 May and related events that contributed to the crisis. The establishment of the facts and circumstances relevant to those events will be critical if Timor-Leste is to achieve reconciliation and uphold the rule of law. The Commission will submit its findings and recommendations by 7 October. The Government considers the domestic justice system to be the primary avenue of accountability for any criminal acts and human rights violations identified by the Commission. We therefore welcome the report of the Secretary-General on justice and reconciliation (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-580.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/580</a>). The Government is considering the recommendations contained therein, and will take appropriate measures.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">We believe that a strong international police presence will be vital if executive policing functions are to be performed in Dili and throughout Timor-Leste while the PNTL is being reconstituted. United Nations police officers will be equally important in assisting and further enhancing the capacity of our national police in the maintenance of law and respect for human rights throughout the districts and subdistricts. While the national police have been trained by United Nations police and bilateral partners and have the basic know-how to carry out routine policing, the most recent events demonstrated the inability of the PNTL to adequately deal with developments that are of a political nature. The impartiality of the PNTL in a tense political environment will be tested again when it deals with the first nationwide elections. The presence of United Nations police will be vital in providing advice and in supporting the national police in planning and carrying out their electoral-related security responsibilities, including through training and assistance in the development and implementation of a comprehensive election security plan aimed at forestalling volatility and possible violence throughout the electoral period.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">The Government is moving to prepare for the upcoming elections. The draft electoral laws on presidential and parliamentary elections, which were submitted to the national Parliament for a broad public debate, are expected to be approved, after the Parliament's annual recess, in mid-September. The President and the Government have agreed to hold both the parliamentary and presidential elections before May 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">The Government of Timor-Leste is committed to a free, fair and credible electoral process. Having consulted internally and having taken due consideration of concerns raised by civil society, the Church and other stakeholders, we have called upon the international community to assist us in that endeavour, including through the provision of technical and logistical support. We intend to continue discussions with the United Nations regarding the most appropriate type of assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">Timor-Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world. While the primary underlying causes of the current crisis are political and institutional, poverty and the related high urban unemployment and the absence of any prospects of employment opportunities, especially for young people, also contributed to the crisis. In order to ensure coordinated support for the economic development of our country, the new mission should work closely with the Government and its partners and provide assistance in the design of poverty-reduction and economic growth policies and strategies so as to promote the goals of our national development plan and work towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa13">The 2006-2007 budget was adopted yesterday by the national Parliament; it represents an increase of 122 per cent compared with the previous fiscal year. As Prime Minister Ramos-Horta has said, the budget is pro-poor and pro-job-creation. We hope and pray that the combination of better economic and social policies and continuing international support in all areas will help us to overcome today's crises.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa14">We acknowledge that there are differences of opinion among Member States, but I am hopeful that the Council will take into account the seriousness of the situation confronting our people and our country today. While there are no more gunshots, many guns remain in civilian hands, and the underlying causes of the conflict have yet to be fully addressed. It will take time for us to reconstitute the defence and police forces. It will take many more years for those institutions to regain the confidence and trust of our people. We therefore believe that the recommendations of the Secretary-General, including the recommendations relating to the presence of a very small military force under the command and control of the United Nations, are important. That is the best option that we have in facing the current crisis in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa15">As a colleague who has for many years shared with Council members the corridors and meeting rooms of this House, I appeal to the Council to work with us in ensuring that Timor-Leste does not relapse into conflict again.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa16">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to UNOTIL and all of its staff, and, in particular, to Special Representative Hasegawa, for the excellent cooperation and support given to the Government and people during the crisis that we recently faced. We would also like to thank the international community for its support, and the embassies in East Timor for their cooperation and support during the crisis. We will work with determination with all of you to guarantee that our people have a great future -- a future in peace, stability and development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01"> I now give the floor to the representative of Finland.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lintonen</span> <span class="nation">Finland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The following countries align themselves with this statement: Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">Two months ago the Council held a public meeting on Timor-Leste (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5457.html">S/PV.5457</a>); the situation in the country seemed critical at that time. Sporadic violence, arson, looting and gang clashes continued to take place and the direction of events still seemed unclear. Since then, the overall security situation has been stabilized and the emergency phase has passed. The European Union commends the countries that responded positively when they were asked for help. The quick reaction of Australia, Portugal, Malaysia and New Zealand has been of immense importance.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">In political terms, very significant steps forward were taken when Mr. José Ramos-Horta was appointed as Prime Minister on 10 July 2006 and when the new Government was formed soon after that. The European Union welcomes that political progress and wishes to congratulate Prime Minister Ramos-Horta and Mr. José Luis Guterres, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, for their challenging assignments. The European Union wants to assure the Security Council of continuous European support for Timor-Leste and the new Government.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">It is necessary to emphasize, however, that it would be erroneous to believe that the situation in Timor-Leste is now stable and in order. The tension is still there, and the humanitarian needs of a significant part of the population are still clearly not being met. More than 150,000 people are still internally displaced; many refuse to return to their homes. Numerous weapons remain unaccounted for and are presumed to be under the control of both individuals and organized groups. That climate of fear is a clear sign of the prevailing fragility of the situation and of the need to address the underlying factors of the crisis, which is far from resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">The events of recent months will have to be analysed with seriousness and honesty. The real problems under the surface will have to be addressed in order to achieve national reconciliation. The European Union is pleased to note that that seems to be exactly what the new Prime Minister intends to do. The Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste, as requested by Mr. Ramos-Horta and announced by the Secretary-General, will have a significant role in that effort. The Commission is expected to report its findings by early October 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">The European Union also underlines that the demand for justice and accountability for the serious crimes committed in 1999 remains a fundamental issue in the lives of many Timorese. The Union therefore welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on justice and reconciliation in Timor-Leste and its recommendations aimed at completing investigations into unresolved serious-crimes cases and promoting reconciliation and community healing. The presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007 naturally underline the importance of political and national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa07">The urgent goal of the international community is to support Timor-Leste in consolidating public order and pursuing reconciliation among all stakeholders and all levels of society. It is obvious that the United Nations will have a central role in that process. Consequently, it is obvious that a strengthened and long-term United Nations engagement will be needed as we ensure Timorese ownership and the sustainability of United Nations efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa08">The views of the Timorese Government -- clearly expressed in the letter dated 4 August 2006 from Prime Minister Ramos-Horta addressed to the President of the Security Council -- and the assessment presented in the report of the Secretary-General on Timor-Leste pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1690(2006).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1690 (2006)</a> must be among the guiding factors when a decision is made on the size and form of the future United Nations mission after the mandate of the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) expires in a few days' time.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa09">The United Nations should commit itself to providing substantial support in various sectors, including the rule of law, human rights, gender, institutional capacity-building, conflict resolution and comprehensive security-sector reform. It is essential that the core functions of the new multidimensional and integrated United Nations mission be carefully identified and that the mission's mandate be decided in a manner that avoids any unnecessary overlapping with current United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and other development partners, which are already making very valuable contributions to the development of Timor-Leste. Efficient coordination, clear responsibilities and a clear division of labour are preconditions for success.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa10">The European Union and its member States have been major development partners of Timor-Leste for years, and the Union continues to pay close attention to the situation in the country. The European Commission's Special Envoy to Timor-Leste, Mr. Miguel Amado, visited Dili quite recently to assess the current situation and to consider ways to strengthen European Commission cooperation with Timor-Leste, including by establishing a Commission delegation in Dili. The European Union is committed to continuing to support Timor-Leste and is confident that, in these times of difficulty, the United Nations will respond to Timor-Leste's call for help in an adequate manner.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I now call on the representative of Singapore.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cheok</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">We express our appreciation to Special Envoy Ian Martin for his briefing and congratulate Foreign Minister Guterres. It is good to see him again.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">Timor-Leste is in a time of need. The international community has responded to such need before. In 1999, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor was established; it was followed by the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor and, recently, by the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste. The question is, of course: What happens next?</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">It is our view that the Secretary-General's report provides the answer. It is an insightful and comprehensive piece with sensible recommendations. It was not conceived in a vacuum; it was based on the assessment mission led by Special Envoy Ian Martin. Mr. Martin and his team consulted a broad cross section of Timorese society and international stakeholders. It is clear that their observations and analysis contributed greatly to the quality of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">This is not just about the United Nations; Timor-Leste's leaders have also spoken. In a letter dated 4 August 2006, Prime Minister José Ramos-Horta said that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg020-bk02-pa05">"a robust police, military and civilian element is indispensable to our hard-won peace and freedom. There is a consensus among all stakeholders that the situation in Timor-Leste requires the establishment of a United Nations multidimensional and integrated peacekeeping mission" (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2006-620.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/620</a>, annex</i>).</blockquote>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">He also spoke of a strong civilian component, a police force of considerable strength and a small military force that would all be under the command and control of the United Nations. If those are the views of Timor-Leste's leaders, then we should listen. The people of Timor-Leste are the ultimate stakeholders in this exercise.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">Nation-building is a delicate process. Timor-Leste's troubles are a vivid reminder that reverses are possible, but that is no reason for discouragement. We should take setbacks in our stride, as rarely has there been a case of absolutely smooth sailing in nation-building. Indeed, this is motivation for us to stay the course and ensure success in the face of difficulty.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">The Secretary-General's report rightfully identified priority areas. Ensuring security and stability is crucial. Here, we must thank Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal for their superb efforts. Security-sector reform is also key. To a large degree, institutional failures in the National Police Force of Timor-Leste and in the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste were at the core of this crisis; they need to be rebuilt. Moreover, there is a need for political reconciliation. Timor-Leste will also need electoral support in the run-up to and during the 2007 elections. Timor-Leste is in a transitional phase, and having both a large United Nations police presence and a smaller military component is essential. Those two components will contribute to the restoration of stability and law and order until the Timorese themselves are ready to fully reassume those roles.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">Albert Einstein once said, "I never think of the future. It comes soon enough." Let me be a bit presumptuous and disagree. We need to think about Timor-Leste's future. We need to help it to put conditions in place to allow for its development as a stable and cohesive nation. In tandem, we need to assist with capacity-building for its institutions and its people. The Secretary-General's report correctly states that this will be a long-term commitment. The United Nations has been at the core of those efforts since Timor-Leste's independence. It will remain at the core of those efforts for the next few years. We should remain committed. If we get this right, we can all look forward to a brighter future for Timor-Leste.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Portugal.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Salgueiro</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">Thank you very much, Mr. President, for this opportunity to address the Security Council. Before I start my remarks, I would like to greet Foreign Minister José Luis Guterres. It is an enormous pleasure to see him here again in this building and especially in the Council. I would also like to thank Mr. Ian Martin for his presentation of the Secretary-General's report on the situation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) and his recommendations for a new United Nations mission. I also take this opportunity to commend the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hasegawa, and his staff for their work in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Portugal concurs with the statement which the representative of Finland has made on behalf of the European Union. But in my national capacity, I would like to add the following.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Regarding the ongoing discussions on the mandate and the composition of a new United Nations mission in Timor-Leste, the Portuguese position is consistent with three main elements. First, we respect the sovereign will and the political independence of Timor-Leste. In this regard, Prime Minister Ramos-Horta sent a letter (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-620.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/620</a>, annex) to the President of the Security Council on 4 August 2006, which clearly sets out the expectations of Timor-Leste concerning the need for the establishment of a United Nations multidimensional and integrated peacekeeping mission.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">Secondly, we welcome the Secretary-General's thorough assessment and the recommendations contained in the report. We praise the Secretariat's professionalism, which we have come to know very well since the days when we were negotiating the self-determination of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">Thirdly, our own assessment is based on our deep bilateral commitment towards Timor-Leste, and especially on the fact that Portugal remains, by far, the largest donor to Timor-Leste, with cooperation programmes in many areas including justice, education, health, social protection, police, armed forces, customs, finances, and so on.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">Although the situation has been stabilized overall, we still face the very serious security and humanitarian repercussions of the crisis. Thousands of weapons remain unaccounted for and could be used in further actions to wreak violent destabilization. A climate of fear still prevails, with about 150,000 internally displaced people, which is a huge number for such a small country. In regard to the police and military weapons that have not been accounted for, we must acknowledge that the international forces have achieved only modest results. It will be difficult to achieve sustainable political reconciliation in an environment where individuals and groups with political grievances are in possession of illegal arms.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">At the Council's last open meeting on Timor-Leste, on 13 June 2006 (see <a href="../html/S-PV-5457.html">S/PV.5457</a>), I stated that Timor-Leste needed the universality and impartiality of the United Nations, which must once again take a leading role. The reality on the ground has reinforced our belief. Only the United Nations can successfully lead the efforts to facilitate political dialogue and reconciliation, restore and maintain security and ensure that the 2007 elections will be peaceful, free and fair.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">In line with the expectations of Timor-Leste, as expressed by Prime Minister Ramos-Horta in his letter of 4 August, and as reiterated today by Foreign Minister José Luis Guterres, Portugal will review the current bilateral arrangement regarding the presence of its gendarmerie force in Timor-Leste, with a view to have that force and other elements ready to serve under the command and control of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">I recall here that one of the key recommendations in the Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, which is widely known as the Brahimi report, regarding the importance of clear, credible and achievable mandates, is that</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">"Security Council resolutions should meet the requirements of peacekeeping operations when they deploy into potentially dangerous situations, especially the need for a clear chain of command and unity of effort." (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2000-809.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/809</a>, para. 64(c)</i>).</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">Portugal fully supports the recommendations of the Secretary-General's report regarding the police and military components of the follow-on mission in Timor-Leste. Also, and as a future contributor to the mission, we attach great importance to the security of all United Nations personnel, including our nationals, and we consequently deem it necessary that this mission be backed by an adequately sized military force under the command and control of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">For both political and operational reasons, we would have great difficulty in understanding any solution which ignored the sovereign will of Timor-Leste, the recommendations of the Secretary-General and the lessons learned of the recent past concerning the need for a clear chain of command and adequate security for United Nations personnel in peacekeeping missions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa13">We welcome the establishment of an Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste, as outlined in the letter of 8 June 2006 from Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta to the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-391.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/391</a>, annex), and especially the fact that all relevant actors considered this to be a necessary step to reach a political settlement and uphold the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa14">The demand for justice and accountability for serious crimes committed in 1999 remains a fundamental issue in the lives of many Timorese. Portugal welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on justice and reconciliation in Timor-Leste (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-580.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/580</a>), and particularly its recommendations aiming at the completion of investigations into outstanding cases of serious crimes and the need for reconciliation and community healing.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa15">Much remains to be done in this regard, as the recent outbursts of violence have demonstrated, namely the attacks on several key Timorese judicial institutions, causing serious concern regarding the potential loss of vital records with the attendant security implications for victims, witnesses and suspects alike. The prevailing climate of impunity is a major obstacle to long-lasting social reconciliation and political stability. It is imperative to establish the truth and achieve accountability, in keeping with international human rights standards.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa16">Portugal recalls the responsibility of the international community and of the Security Council in relation to Timor-Leste. Portugal will remain committed to the consolidation of peace, democracy and the full political independence of Timor-Leste.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jenie</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, let me start by congratulating you on your assumption of your important post and by expressing my pleasure at seeing you in the Chair. We are confident that, under your able stewardship, the Council will effectively discharge its tasks, dealing with the issues of high importance being brought before it in this very busy month.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">My appreciation goes to the Secretary-General for his report (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) and to the Secretary-General's Special Envoy, Mr. Ian Martin, for his informative briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">Permit me to join the previous speakers in welcoming His Excellency Foreign Minister José Luis Guterres of Timor-Leste to today's Council meeting. His statement before the Council provides guidance for the creation of a new mission of the United Nations in his country.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">We continue to follow closely the situation in Timor-Leste, and we are heartened that the country has managed to emerge from the recent crisis there. The new Government, which enjoys support from a wide spectrum of Timorese society, has been installed. In this regard, words of appreciation go to Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal for their valuable efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">In order to achieve sustainable peace and stability in the country, we continue fully to support Timor-Leste in advancing political dialogue and community reconciliation, particularly by addressing the underlying causes of the recent crisis. We are confident that, under the wise guidance of its leaders, Timor-Leste will be able to put its democratization process back on track and resume its national development on a stronger foundation.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">Despite all the hardships being faced by Timor-Leste on account of the recent crisis, that country continues to enjoy an excellent level of bilateral relations with Indonesia. The rapport between leaders of the two countries is firm, assured and growing. President Xanana Gusmão of Timor-Leste flew to Bali to meet his counterpart, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, on 17 June 2006, to brief the latter on the situation in his country and the actions being taken by his Government to address the situation. Indonesia has shown its full understanding of the situation and is demonstrating its commitment to help Timor-Leste to address the crisis, including by providing humanitarian aid. As Timor-Leste's closest neighbour, we are very interested in seeing a stable, prosperous and democratic Timor-Leste. We are fully aware that dealing with the daunting challenges it faces is beyond that country's existing national capacity. Hence, it is the responsibility of the international community to continue assisting that country to achieve self-sufficiency. In this regard, we support the establishment of a new United Nations mission in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa07">We believe that the United Nations mission, which is recommended for an initial period of 12 months, should focus on helping the country to meet the pressing challenges ahead and the real needs of the Government and the people of Timor-Leste. These include the promotion of national reconciliation and social cohesion; capacity-building of various State and Government institutions, including the enhancement of further public confidence in them; poverty reduction and humanitarian assistance; and democratization, which includes electoral assistance for the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">Let me now turn to the issue of justice and reconciliation for Timor-Leste. We hope that the Secretary-General's report on this subject (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-580.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/580</a>) provides a new departure for the Organization in dealing with this issue in a practical and feasible manner. As has been stated on many occasions, the Governments of Indonesia and of Timor-Leste are committed to resolving residual problems from the past and to opening a new chapter by developing forward-looking relations and cooperation. In this spirit, the two countries agreed to settle the human rights violations reported in East Timor in 1999. Due to the complexity of the problem, an innovative and creative solution has been devised that would also strengthen further good relations between the two countries in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">The Commission of Truth and Friendship (CTF) has achieved meaningful progress. It has agreed on the elaboration of basic issues relating to its terms of reference and has adopted a glossary of terminology as the operational reference; these constitute clarification and the CTF's creative interpretation of various provisions in its terms of reference, including the one on amnesty, on the basis of relevant international norms, standards and practices that take into account local needs and challenges. It has also adopted guiding principles as the overarching guide to document review, fact-finding methods, information clarification with respect to relevant parties, naming names and standards of evidence.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">As mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General, the CTF has identified 14 groups of priority cases. These consist of high-profile cases that are often referred to in media reports; events that continue to be commemorated emotionally by Timor-Leste society as a collective memory; cases that reflect crimes as defined in article 7 of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court (ICC) regarding crimes against humanity; and cases referred to in the final report of the Indonesian national Commission of inquiry into Human Rights Violations in East Timor in 1999, and other documents, as mandated in article 14 of its terms of reference.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa11">The CTF is currently focusing on completing document review through document matching, corroboration and analysis, based on the report of the Indonesian national Commission of inquiry into Human Rights Violations in East Timor in 1999, the documents of the proceedings of the Indonesian Ad Hoc Human Rights Court, the documents of the Special Panel for Serious Crimes and the report of the Timor-Leste Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa12">While completing the document review and analysis, the CTF has now moved into the second stage of its work programme, namely, fact-finding, which employs four methods: statement taking, submission, investigation and hearings.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa13">In order to garner support and input, the CTF has carried out consultations with other stakeholders in both countries, including parliaments, civil societies and Government officials. With a view to expanding its vision and getting inputs, the CTF has invited international experts and prominent figures to share their knowledge and experience.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa14">On a regular basis, and as required in its terms of reference, the Commission reports to the two Governments on progress, as well as on challenges and obstacles it encounters in implementing its mandate. The heads of State of Indonesia and Timor-Leste, on 7 February 2006, agreed to extend the CTF's mandate until July 2007. My Government has strong confidence in the work of the CTF and is very much committed to continuing to ensure its credibility.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa15">In conclusion, Indonesia, as a neighbour which shares a common vision with Timor-Leste, based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, forward-looking, reconciliatory and mutually beneficial relations, will, for its part, continue to assist Timor-Leste to make further progress in consolidating peace, stability and democracy in the country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tarragô</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank the Ghanaian presidency for convening this debate on the situation in Timor-Leste. That country, as a new member of the international community, continues to deserve the support of the United Nations in its struggle to consolidate its independence.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">I wish to extend my warmest welcome to His Excellency José Luis Guterres, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs of Timor-Leste. I also acknowledge the presence of Ambassador Luis Fonseca, Executive Secretary of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, with whose statement we associate ourselves.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">May I also mention the remarkable work done by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Ian Martin, and his team. Their thorough and insightful report must serve as the basis for the deliberations on the future of the United Nations presence in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">The situation in Timor-Leste in the last few months has reminded us of some valuable lessons in the field of peacekeeping. We have had bad experiences when the presence of the United Nations was shortened for budgetary reasons or to comply with artificial time frames. The drawdown of peacekeeping operations should only be carried out upon achievement of real progress in recovering from conflict and in building institutions. One cannot but recall that the precipitous decision to leave Timor-Leste might have contributed to the security troubles of the past few months.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa05">The second mistake is not to give proper attention to national ownership in the peacekeeping and peacebuilding processes. While the support of the international community is valuable -- indeed, indispensable -- in order to be effective and welcome by the people, it must respect the sovereign decisions of the Timorese.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Planning and deciding on the mission are also essential features not to be dismissed in the case of Timor-Leste. Suffice it to recall the words of the Brahimi report just cited by the Permanent Representative of Portugal. The new mission should be endowed with a clear mandate and adequate means to fulfil it. Depriving the mission of the necessary means -- personnel, financial or other -- would only hamstring it in discharging its mandate and would probably entail further suffering and be more costly in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">My Government believes that the Council has a clear responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the people of Timor-Leste. We think that the Council will honour its commitment to Timor-Leste by taking the decision to create a new mission in line with the report of the Secretary-General, which has accurately captured the meaning of national ownership and taken on board the will of the Timor-Leste Government.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">May I refer to the Brazilian Government's concern at a tendency to transfer responsibilities of the United Nations, and of the Security Council, to individual countries? While such expediency may help and be salutary in emergencies, it carries many risks if it is prolonged; risks that range from associating the United Nations with the condoning of "neo-trusteeship", to prejudicing the image of the United Nations as a neutral and impartial provider of assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa09">It will be critical for the credibility and implementation of the Council's decisions that the establishment of the new mission be made in full agreement with the Timorese authorities and that, whatever its configuration, the mission report to the Security Council periodically. It is our view that the new peacekeeping operation must comprise elements in all relevant areas. In particular, it should have a civilian component, including a strong electoral unit; a police component capable of ensuring public safety; and a small military component under United Nations command and control. Brazil is, at present, considering seriously the possibility of contributing troops to the military component of the mission, alongside contributions it can make to the other elements. But it would do so on the understanding that the mission will be truly multilateral and fully accountable to the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">Creating the mission is only part of the work. It is highly necessary that countries reinforce their bilateral cooperation with Timor-Leste in areas that are essential to a newly born State, such as capacity-building, electoral assistance, development planning and civil administration. The Brazilian Government has already taken steps to start new projects and to continue with the previous ones.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">The efforts of the Timorese towards reconciliation and their search for justice should be equally acknowledged. We should support the Timorese Government's decisions that are meant to tackle the acute problems of development and to find ways to improve the well-being of its people. Instability and unrest will fade only once poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and other root causes of conflict are effectively addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">The ultimate responsibility for settling the present crisis lies with the Timorese Government and people. But the United Nations and its Member States have a share of the responsibility to assist that country in setting itself on the path towards peace and development. The way to do this is through respecting the will of Timor-Leste, as so ably expressed here by Minister Guterres.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of the Philippines.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg025-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Baja</span> <span class="nation">Philippines</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">I congratulate the Ghanaian presidency, which is in the midst of its successful leadership of the Council. We welcome His Excellency José Luis Guterres, and congratulate him on his new role as Foreign Minister of Timor-Leste. We thank him for his important statement this morning. We also thank Special Envoy Ian Martin for his briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">The Council is engaged in the discussion of Timor-Leste in the context of the morning after the morning after. We therefore have the opportunity to apply lessons learned not only from recent developments in the country, but also from similar situations in other parts of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">As the international community, particularly the United Nations, ponders its subsequent involvement in Timor-Leste, my delegation believes that the following factors have to be taken into account. First, Timor-Leste ownership must be ensured in any peacebuilding plan for the country. It is important that the views, aspirations and sentiments of the Government and the people of Timor-Leste be factored into any decision to be taken by the Security Council, particularly when it concerns the deployment of a United Nations mission.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">We acknowledge and endorse Timor-Leste's desire for the establishment of a new multidimensional integrated United Nations peacekeeping mission, which is also the recommendation of the Secretary-General contained in his report of 8 August 2006 (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>). That will ensure sustained domestic support and eventual success in the long run. However great outside efforts in support of Timor-Leste may be, they can only succeed to an extent based on the effectiveness of the cooperation of Timor-Leste's Government and its citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Secondly, the root causes which precipitated the latest crisis should be addressed. The Secretary-General's report describes in comprehensive detail the events of the past three months as a complex crisis with political, institutional, historical, social and economic dimensions. Action should therefore be geared towards providing solutions to the problems in those areas. Foremost is assistance in building and strengthening institutions of State. Progress in that area could have been maintained if the United Nations presence in Timor-Leste had not been prematurely diminished. The economic difficulties and deficiencies of Timor-Leste should also be addressed. We note that the new mission recommended by the Secretary-General includes components which will specifically tackle those issues.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">Thirdly, it is necessary to listen to the views of all the major stakeholders in the issue -- Timor-Leste, States in the region, friends of Timor-Leste, donors and troop contributors -- so that the international community, specifically the United Nations, can make an informed decision on the next course of action for Timor-Leste. Today's meeting fulfils that need.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa07">We need once again to invest time, effort and resources in Timor-Leste. We commend the immediate response of Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal in deploying troops to quell the violence and maintain law and order in the country. Their actions show what countries in the region and friends can do to assist in alleviating crises and preventing them from further expanding. We hope that their valuable contributions will find a role in the new mission.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa08">Ultimately, the future of Timor-Leste depends, to a large extent, on the Timorese themselves. Having gained hard-won independence, they should now get their act together. That means maintaining meaningful dialogue among national players, addressing faction-ridden splits, searching for employment opportunities for young people and focusing on developing new orientations and values that would promote tolerance and openness. Timor-Leste can remain on track if it follows a focused post-conflict peacebuilding development framework with the assistance of the international community. Also, the new mission should serve as an early warning device to alert the Timorese authorities and the international community about developments which could lead to an impending crisis. In that context, we believe that Timor-Leste is a prime situation for consideration in the Peacebuilding Commission. We wish to recall that several speakers, including the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly, mentioned Timor-Leste at the inaugural meeting of the Peacebuilding Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa09">Despite the events of the past months, Timor-Leste is still one of the best examples of a successful international enterprise engineered through the combined cooperative efforts of the United Nations and regional partners and players. The international community should continue to make Timor-Leste a success story. We will maintain our presence in the country and we are ready to contribute to successful peacebuilding programmes there.</p>

	<p id="pg026-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Malaysia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hamidon</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">My delegation joins others in congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. We also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of France, for his stewardship of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">I wish to thank you and members of the Council for convening this public debate to consider the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1690(2006).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1690 (2006)</a>. I would like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, Mr. José Luis Guterres, for his invaluable briefing, and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ian Martin, for his comprehensive presentation of the report.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">We welcome the report of the Secretary-General. It is clear from the report that the process of nation-building and reconciliation is a highly complex and sensitive matter. At the same time, the formation of a sustainable democratic State will require a higher level of maturity on the part of the people of Timor-Leste. In that regard, we hope that the leaders of Timor-Leste will place great emphasis on the issue of the rights of the people. Given current developments, we firmly believe in the will and ability of the leadership and the people of Timor-Leste to tackle the crucial issues facing the country. Malaysia believes that, with political stability and sound economic and social planning, the economy will gradually progress and develop.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">We would also like to commend the Security Council for coming to the aid of Timor-Leste in its hour of need, and especially for supporting the deployment of the international security force, which has played a significant role in maintaining peace and security in the country. As the Council prepares to re-engage in Timor-Leste, in establishing a follow-up mission it is crucial that the quality as well as the duration of the international presence be evaluated and improved. In that regard, Malaysia supports the establishment of a multidimensional and integrated United Nations peacekeeping mission, prioritizing the long-term needs of the people of Timor-Leste, and in that regard recognizes their immediate humanitarian and security concerns. We have confidence that the United Nations is able to meet Timor-Leste's need for economic development, education, recovery, transparency, capacity-building and justice in a comprehensive and effective manner.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa05">Timor-Leste is an independent, sovereign member of the community of nations. In the exercise of its rights, the request contained in the letter dated 4 August 2006 addressed to the Secretary-General from the Prime Minister of the Republic of Timor-Leste should be the basis for serious consideration by the Security Council and the international community. The request for a strong civilian component, with a police force of considerable strength backed by a small military force under the command and control of the United Nations, is a matter of vital urgency for the mandate of the new mission, in conformity with the will of the Timorese people. The call was a manifestation of Timor-Leste's exercise of its rights as a sovereign nation. In that regard, we call on the United Nations and other international agencies, including the international security forces, to respect the spirit and decisions of the people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa06">Malaysia will continue to uphold its commitment to the collective attainment of global peace through its unwavering support of the central role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security. In August 2003, the Royal Malaysian Police deployed a self-sustained unit consisting of 125 personnel to serve in the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor to form the international police unit in support of the Timor-Leste national police. Currently, the Royal Malaysian Police continues to deploy a formed police unit of up to 250 police personnel under a bilateral agreement between the Government of Malaysia and the Government of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa07">The Government of Malaysia is continuously reviewing its position with a view to being further involved in Timor-Leste. In that regard, Malaysia looks forward to and is ready to meet our obligations in the form of making available a formed police unit of up to 140 police personnel for the new mission in Timor-Leste. Malaysia shall continue to provide competent and well-trained police officers to that component.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa08">Finally, it is clear to Malaysia, judging from the Secretary-General's report, that the international community must assess and take stock of the progress and challenges faced by the Government and people of Timor-Leste, and that it has a common responsibility to contribute to Timor-Leste's progress and development in the period following the draw-down of the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste. It is crucial for us to meet the urgent and indispensable requirements of the country in its time of need. In that connection, my delegation looks forward to the adoption of a comprehensive draft resolution to meet the urgent needs of Timor-Leste.</p>

	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Cape Verde.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Lima da Veiga</span> <span class="nation">Cape Verde</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">May I thank you, Sir, and, through you, the members of this Council for allowing the delegation of Cape Verde to participate in this debate, which is so important for Timor-Leste and for all those who genuinely wish to see that country treading the path of peace, stability and progress. Since this is the first time my delegation is addressing the Council under your presidency, let me congratulate you on assuming that important position. We wish you continued success in discharging your mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">My delegation expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his two very informative reports, and to Mr. Ian Martin, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, for his insightful briefing and assessment of the situation in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">We also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, Mr. José Luis Guterres, for his important statement.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">Furthermore, we associate ourselves with the statement to be made by Ambassador Luis Fonseca, Executive Secretary of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">Sharing significant historical, political and cultural ties with Timor-Leste, Cape Verde has always supported the struggle of the Timorese for a free, independent and prosperous country, coexisting peacefully with its neighbours. We have therefore been following very closely the evolution of the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">Concerning the security situation, we are heartened to learn about the positive measures adopted by the Timorese authorities in order to foster reconciliation, confidence and dialogue within the population and among the main political stakeholders. Yet the root causes of the recent crises are still to be tackled. That is a prerequisite for the success of the State-building process and the holding of the first presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007. We therefore encourage the authorities and all stakeholders to demonstrate perseverance, tolerance and cooperation in order to speed up the process. Furthermore, steady back-up from the international community is much needed if that huge task is to succeed.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa07">As part of the international effort to restore normalcy to the country, we commend the role played by Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal. However, as the Timorese authorities have themselves acknowledged, the current situation requires that the prevailing arrangements regarding the international forces be reviewed.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa08">Therefore, and in line with the common position of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, the Capeverdian delegation supports the call of the Timorese authorities for a robust, multidisciplinary and integrated mission that is adequate to the situation prevailing in Timor-Leste. With a small military component placed under the control and command of the United Nations, such a mission would be very instrumental in consolidating peace and stability and in assisting in the preparation of the electoral process, in full respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa09">We are pleased to note that the Secretary-General has given due consideration to that request and has incorporated it into its report. We are confident that the proposals made in the report deserve the indispensable adherence of the members of this Council and that the mission will be given the necessary resources and means to successfully carry out its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa10">Lasting peace and stability in Timor-Leste will be achieved only when the country's development challenges are addressed in a comprehensive way. In that context, we are heartened by the political determination and leadership of the Timorese authorities in launching long-term initiatives and plans with a view to reinforcing the still-fragile internal stability, consolidate and maximize the major progress achieved in State-building and meet the challenges ahead in the political, judicial, legal, economic and social sectors. Those efforts deserve firm, generous and sustainable support from the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa11">That is the reason my delegation welcomes the recommendations of the Secretary-General on the ways and means to reinforce security and to assist the authorities in promoting development that is pro-poor, gender-sensitive, youth-focused and aimed at enhancing institution-building, governance and democracy. Cape Verde stands ready to continue to cooperate with Timor-Leste and the international community towards the achievement of those goals. Cape Verde experts are already assisting the Timorese authorities in capacity- and institution-building in the fields of justice and public administration, under a framework of international cooperation. On the bilateral level, Cape Verde and Timor-Leste have already agreed on plans and programmes to foster a fruitful partnership in areas of common interest.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Cuba.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg028-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Malmierca Díaz</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">First of all, on behalf of the Cuban delegation, allow me to commend you, Sir, on the work you and your team have been carrying out in the presidency of the Security Council this month. I would also like very much to welcome the presence at this meeting of Mr. José Luis Guterres, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste. We thank him for his valuable statement he made this morning. We also welcome the presence and statement of Mr. Ian Martin, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">The situation in Timor-Leste is the result of the structural underdevelopment of that Asian nation and one of the most telling cases of the nefarious consequences of colonialism and of the unjust and exclusive current international order. When it comes to the situation in Timor-Leste and other third world countries, attention in the United Nations is almost always focused exclusively on security issues. In practice, little or no attention is given to the urgent and serious structural, economic and social problems afflicting those countries. The eradication of poverty and underdevelopment is a key prerequisite in the maintenance of international peace and security. There can be no peace without development or development without peace.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">With regard to security issues, the efforts of the international community in Timor-Leste, as in any other country, should fully respect the sovereignty and independence of that State. The Government of Timor-Leste has clearly stated its position as to the form that the presence of international actors in the country should take under a United Nations mandate. Cuba believes that the wishes and interests expressed in that regard by the Government and people of Timor-Leste should be duly taken into account by the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">The challenges to be overcome by the people and Government of Timor-Leste in the coming years require enormous resources that are far beyond the capacities of a State with limited resources. Genuine international cooperation with that country, based on respect for its sovereignty, will be one of the main ways to prevent conflict and strengthen peace. The international community has a moral obligation to help Timor-Leste to build a future of political stability and sustainable socio-economic development. It must undertake a serious commitment to assist Timor-Leste's Government in training human resources and establishing the infrastructure that this Asian country so urgently needs.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">Cuba, a small country that has for more than 45 years been subject to the most brutal and merciless economic, financial and commercial blockade ever suffered by any country, has continued its modest cooperation with Timor-Leste. Cuba's cooperation with that country extends to various sectors, but primarily to the area of health care. Cuba's medical assistance has included treating 440,849 patients, assisting in 3,620 births, carrying out 2,198 surgical operations, administering vaccinations to 7,496 persons and saving over 6,000 lives.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">Despite the situation experienced by that country, Cuban aid workers, who are strictly committed to the principle of non-interference in Timor-Leste's internal affairs, have remained at their posts. In particular, Cuba's medical brigade -- which is made up of 274 health workers, of whom 206 are medical doctors -- has been a model of selfless cooperation, saving lives under the most difficult conditions. In addition to providing basic and specialized health services, that team is holding classes and running the recently opened school of medicine, which began classes in December 2005 with 60 students. Moreover, 40 clinical laboratory technicians are finishing their studies and 22 x-ray technicians are currently being trained. As a complement to that effort, 470 young people from Timor-Leste are studying in Cuba, most of them preparing to begin their medical studies in our country and others to enrol in other specialties.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">We are not here to lecture. What Cuba is doing today for Timor-Leste is just a modest example of how much more could be achieved in that country through international cooperation and solidarity, mainly by those States with larger economic and financial resources. We are certain that more could also be done for Timor-Leste in the context of the United Nations. We hope that this Security Council debate will contribute to defining short-term strategies that are in line with the real needs of the people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa08">Lastly, my delegation would like to reiterate that the people of Timor-Leste can always count on Cuba's unwavering determination to continue to strengthen its assistance and solidarity. In so doing, we will be meeting a duty and honouring a debt of gratitude to the peoples of the third world -- in this case to the people of Timor-Leste, who have always demonstrated their resolute and constant friendship and solidarity with my country.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of New Zealand.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Banks</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report on Timor-Leste and for his recommendations on the future involvement of the United Nations. I would like to commend in particular the work of Special Envoy Ian Martin and his assessment team, who have produced a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the challenges facing Timor-Leste today. While there are some elements of the report that do concern us, on the whole we believe it provides a very sound blueprint for United Nations engagement with Timor-Leste in the coming years.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">Given the lateness of the hour, my statement will be a shortened version of the statement that is being circulated.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">The security situation in Timor-Leste has begun to stabilize. It remains clear, however, that outbreaks of violence are still possible and that international assistance will be required for some time to guarantee the safety of the Timorese people. The stability that has been achieved has allowed initial steps to be taken towards political and social reconciliation, a process that must be protected and encouraged.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">The Secretary-General's report highlights the multitude of difficulties that the new United Nations mission in Timor-Leste will face. Against that background, New Zealand wholeheartedly endorses the report's emphasis on a sustained commitment and a coordinated approach. We believe that we should articulate that commitment by giving the new United Nations mission an extended initial mandate and strongly affirming that that mandate must be renewed. Our long-term commitment to Timor-Leste is likely to be counted in years, not months.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">We support the call for a compact between Timor-Leste and the international community to ensure coordination between the mission and Timorese Government priorities, plans and budgeting processes. The building of the new mission in Timor-Leste must be done in a carefully coordinated way with the United Nations funds and programmes, multilateral donors and bilateral partners.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">It is clear that the new mission must have strong and dynamic leadership. The new special representative will need flexibility in his use of resources and must convey a sense of vision and authority to the Government and people of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">As the report notes, the failures of the Timorese defence and police forces are interconnected. We welcome, therefore, the call for a holistic review of the security sector encompassing reform of both defence and police. That should involve "first principles" discussions with the Timorese Government and civil society on the nation's real security needs and the structures that are best suited to meeting those needs.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">In terms of military support for the new United Nations mission, New Zealand is comfortable with the recommendations contained in the report. We realize, however, that consensus has not yet emerged around those arrangements, and we look forward to working closely with all interested stakeholders to find a solution that meets all of our concerns. From New Zealand's perspective as one of the contributors to the current stabilization force, it is important that the military presence in Timor-Leste, however it evolves, enjoy broad-based support and clearly recognized international legitimacy.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">The report proposes a substantial United Nations policing component. New Zealand remains concerned that the number of police being sought may be too great. The United Nations police will have a short-term role in front-line policing, but we hope they will be able to move quickly to working with the National Police Force of Timor-Leste (PNTL), aiding in its reform and recovery.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa10">We note that the placing of United Nations police in front-line policing positions and the subsequent gradual increase in the numbers of PNTL patrolling alongside them will not of itself lead to the creation of a new and robust PNTL. That process has been relied on in the past and has failed. The rebuilding of the PNTL must be a deliberate process based on one training model and led by police trainers from a single bilateral partner.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa11">The recommendations in the report relating to justice and human rights are of crucial importance. New Zealand has consistently supported the work of the Serious Crimes Unit, and we are pleased that its investigations will resume.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa12">We also consider it vital to address the problems confronting the day-to-day functioning of the criminal justice system. To be effective and durable, all the institutions of government must connect with all Timorese. We hope that, as part of its work on institutional capacity-building and governance, the mission will encourage the full functioning of government, including the justice sector, in both official languages -- Portuguese and Tetun.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa13">Finally, we continue to urge the Timorese leadership to work together to regain the confidence of its people. Now is the time for strong and united leadership. In that context, may I congratulate Foreign Minister Guterres on his appointment and thank him for his update and for his words of determined commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa14">We are relying on Timor's political leaders to take responsibility for the future of their nation and to rebuild respect for the political process. We are encouraged by the first steps; they must continue, and we must do all we can to provide sustained support.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">I give the floor to the representative of Australia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Hill</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa01">We would like to take this opportunity to thank Special Representative Hasegawa and the staff of the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) for their dedicated efforts. We also thank Ian Martin and his team, and congratulate them on a thorough and professional investigation into the situation in East Timor. We congratulate Minister Guterres on his appointment and wish him well for the future. The international community was quick to respond to the deterioration in the situation in Timor-Leste with the dispatch of an international stabilization force, which has successfully restored security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">We have now all had the opportunity to consider the Secretary-General's comprehensive report and must focus on moving forward, in partnership with Timor-Leste, to secure that country's future stability, security and prosperity. Australia has been at the forefront of efforts by the international community to assist Timor-Leste. Along with Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal, we dispatched troops and police to Timor-Leste in response to the crisis. We contributed 8 million Australian dollars to address humanitarian aspects. We have provided 450 million Australian dollars in development assistance to the country since 1999. We will provide an estimated 43 million Australian dollars during 2006 and 2007. That will involve a strong focus on strengthening governance institutions, including in law and justice, public administration and public sector financial management, and improving delivery of services to rural populations. And we stand ready to contribute to a new United Nations mission in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa03">As a close friend and neighbour of Timor-Leste, Australia has a vital interest in ensuring that it develop as a stable democracy, and we are willing to take a leading role in the international community's efforts to ensure a better future for the Timorese people.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa04">The United Nations must also continue to play a robust role in supporting Timor-Leste. The United Nations should focus its resources on those areas of key concern where the United Nations can make a difference.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa05">We welcome the emphasis on support for political and community reconciliation contained in the Secretary-General's report. To ensure long-term stability, it is vital that the United Nations assist Timor-Leste in resolving political difficulties. We welcome the proposal to provide electoral assistance to Timor-Leste ahead of next year's elections. Those elections represent an important step in the country's political maturation, and it is in the interests of all of us to ensure their success. It is important, however, that efforts to support elections give priority to ensuring that Timor-Leste establish electoral institutions which are, and are accepted by all stakeholders as being, politically neutral, independent and professional in all respects.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa06">We are pleased with the priority given to policing in the report. Public security is a prerequisite of building both a democracy and an economy. We accept, for the time being, the need to have a force with an executive capability. We are pleased with the emphasis on the community policing model, which will not only best address local needs but also help build public confidence.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa07">We are pleased with the acceptance of the need to help build a sustainable Timor-Leste police force that will have the confidence and culture to be able to deal with any future crisis of law and order in a fair and just way. We will offer a significant contribution to policing.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa08">The security task for the future is primarily a law and order one, but to be addressed by civilian police. However, we accept that for some time there will be a need for a military back-up to the police and for the additional security of the United Nations personnel and property that a military force can give. We also accept the desirability of support from a military force while a significant number of high-powered weapons remain unaccounted for.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa09">We are currently contributing up to 2,000 troops to the international stabilization force. While we are gradually drawing down our contribution as conditions improve, we have indicated that we are prepared to continue to provide a force that is required to meet both of the needs to which I referred. In consultation with Timor-Leste, we would seek regional participation in such a force, which would provide both a rapid deployment capability and security for the United Nations. That would ensure a flexible force with its own air mobility, which could, at short notice, be bolstered to meet unexpected circumstances -- a force familiar with the environment and the tasks with proven command and control. It would be cost-saving and would enable the United Nations mission to focus on the tasks that can be best done by the United Nations and where a real need exists. With regard to both the policing and the military tasks, we believe it is important that the Security Council provide authority under Chapter VII to permit the effective functioning of the forces, together with the support that they are entitled to expect.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa10">The international community is again ready to come to the assistance of Timor-Leste, and Australia will play its part. A new United Nations mission represents an important opportunity to repair and rebuild those institutions which have been damaged or destroyed during the recent crisis and to further strengthen those institutions which have shown resilience.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa11">Above all, the United Nations and the many friends of Timor-Leste in the international community must lay the groundwork that will enable the Timorese people to take responsibility for their own affairs.</p>

	<p id="pg032-bk01-pa01">I now call on Mr. Luis Fonseca, Executive Secretary of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg032-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fonseca</span> <span class="non-nation">Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa01">At the outset, let me thank you, Mr. President, and the other members of the Security Council for inviting the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) to take part in this important meeting, which is expected to form the basis for decisions crucial for the future of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa02">The CPLP welcomes the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) and its conclusions, which coincide to a large extent with the views that have been expressed in various United Nations forums on this subject.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa03">I wish to commend Mr. Ian Martin for his efforts to help find a sustainable solution to the crisis in Timor-Leste. I would also like to express support for the statement delivered to the Security Council by Mr. José Luis Guterres, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa04">Like the numerous other friends of Timor-Leste, CPLP member States followed with great concern the events that led to the situation now under consideration by the Security Council and were deeply saddened by their tragic results. On 18 June 2006, in the wake of those events, the CPLP Council of Ministers held an emergency meeting in Lisbon and adopted a political declaration expressing their countries' solidarity with the Timorese people, offering assistance and endorsing the request of the Timorese authorities for the establishment of a new United Nations mission with police, military and civil components that would support the stabilization and peacebuilding efforts. They also expressed the willingness of their countries to participate in such a mission.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa05">A ministerial mission was dispatched to Timor-Leste to assess the situation and to offer assistance to the authorities in their efforts to restore stability and pursue the path of development, which had been interrupted by the events. The results of the ministerial mission were reviewed by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State and Government of the CPLP, held in Bissau on 17 July 2006, which reaffirmed its solidarity with the people and the authorities of Timor-Leste and reiterated the right of Timor-Leste to the full exercise of its national sovereignty in all respects, with the aim of building its future in peace and independence and without any restraints or limitations.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa06">CPLP member States believe that they can make a positive contribution to the international efforts to bring peace, stability and democracy to Timor-Leste. Our member States have shown their commitment to and solidarity with Timor-Leste in the past by contributing to the country's development, both bilaterally and through international initiatives in the context of United Nations coordinated programmes. They are prepared to continue to contribute to the current international efforts within the United Nations framework to restore stability in Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa07">We are pleased to note that the report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2006-628.pdf" class="pdf">S/2006/628</a>) on the future role of the United Nations in Timor-Leste contains positions expressed by the CPLP Council of Ministers. The report meets with our approval, and we support it. We note that the report also emphasizes that the actions of the United Nations and of the rest of the international community in Timor-Leste will be undertaken in cooperation and coordination with the legitimate national Government. We agree that there is a need to establish a strong police force and a small military force under United Nations command and control. Full respect for the sovereignty of the independent nation of Timor-Leste and for its institutions is, in our view, a basic prerequisite for the success of our collective endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa08">Reform of the security sector is a crucial task, on which a large part of the mission's attention and resources will be concentrated. The Secretary-General's report acknowledges the difficulties in the armed forces and the police force, requiring the coordination of efforts to reform those sectors. This is a matter of great importance about which serious decisions should be made -- decisions that will require planning for the long term and careful thought as to the role and responsibilities of military forces in Timor-Leste's future.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa09">The report also fully recognizes the need for better police training, for the strengthening of the operational independence and internal accountability of the police, and for credible, independent civilian oversight of police operations. In response to the observations and the appeal made in paragraphs 67 and 68 of the report, CPLP member States will consider active participation in the provision of assistance to that sector.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa10">The assessment mission to Timor-Leste acknowledged that sustainable economic development must also be a central element in the mission's mandate and recognized the link between economic development and security, pointing out that poverty, high unemployment and a lack of foreseeable opportunities are underlying causes of the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa11">Another very sensitive issue stressed by the CPLP is the dialogue among Timorese political forces, a condition essential for the country's development. That should be reflected in the mission's mandate, which must stress the need for political good offices and reconciliation. The CPLP ministers also underlined the importance of holding general elections in 2007 with a view to consolidating the democratic institutions of Timor-Leste, and they expressed their readiness to assist in ensuring the success of the electoral process. Electoral support is part of the mission's mandate, which must be accompanied by a much-needed programme promoting broad civic education and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa12">Human rights, the administration of justice, institutional capacity-building, good governance, gender issues and public information are issues central to the mandate of the mission, whose structure will, we hope, enable it to accomplish its purposes.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa13">We are aware that, at the present juncture in world affairs, a number of more pressing issues are attracting international attention. But that should not cause us to forget the plight of the Timorese people or the Timorese experience, which for some time appeared to be -- and, we are convinced, still can be -- a United Nations success story. The "compact" proposed by the Secretary-General appears to be a right step towards that goal.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa14">Building a nation requires will, determination and the democratic participation of all. Four years as an independent nation is too short a period in which to achieve such far-reaching accomplishments. What the international community is expected to do is help the Timorese people return to the path of reconciliation, peace and development on which they embarked four years ago. That is not beyond reach; it will consist mostly of walking another mile in terms of the commitment they undertook when the new nation was welcomed as a Member of the United Nations. CPLP countries wish to play an active part in the international engagement to that end.</p>
