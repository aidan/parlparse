	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">The Security Council is meeting in response to the request contained in a letter dated 1 December 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Mozambique to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1373.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/1373</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Members of the Council have received photocopies of a letter dated 13 December 1994 from the Permanent Representative of Mozambique to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General, which will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-1994-1417.pdf" class="nolink">S/1994/1417</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes the installation of the President of the Republic of Mozambique and the inauguration of the new Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique following the first Mozambican multi-party elections, as provided for in the General Peace Agreement, that were held on 27, 28 and 29 October 1994, which were declared as having been free and fair and were endorsed by the Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-960(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 960 (1994)</a> of 21 November 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council congratulates the people and the parties of Mozambique for their peaceful fulfilment of the goals set out in the General Peace Agreement. It encourages them to continue their efforts in good faith to ensure post-election harmony on the basis, <i>inter alia, </i>of the observance of democratic principles. It believes that, with the new governmental structure in place, the foundations have been laid to secure lasting peace, stability, national reconciliation and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council commends the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) and its staff for their fulfilment of the mandate of ONUMOZ and for their efforts in assisting the successful achievement of the objectives of the General Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council notes that, ONUMOZ having completed its mission, its mandate has come to an end and ONUMOZ will be finally withdrawn from Mozambique by 31 January 1995 in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-957(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 957 (1994)</a> of 15 November 1994. In this connection, it looks forward to the Secretary-General's report on the final disposition of the assets of ONUMOZ within the framework of the withdrawal of ONUMOZ, as requested in its statement of 7 September 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-51.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/51</a>). In that context, it also expresses the hope that effective arrangements for the disposition and, as appropriate, the destruction of weapons and the establishment, with the assistance of the United Nations, of a national demining capability will be in place prior to the final withdrawal of ONUMOZ, and that consideration will be given to leaving demining and other equipment in Mozambique after the withdrawal, subject to the appropriate arrangements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council emphasizes that the post-election period will be an important and delicate time, during which there is a continuing need for the international community to assist the Government and people of Mozambique in the reconstruction and redevelopment of their country. It notes the intention of the Secretary-General to report to the competent United Nations bodies on future United Nations activities in Mozambique. It urges all States and relevant international organizations to contribute actively to these efforts."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-80.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/80</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
