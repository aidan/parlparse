	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">I wish to draw the attention of members to <a href="../pdf/S-2005-438.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/438</a>, containing the text of a letter dated 7 July 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Egypt to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest possible terms the assassination of the recently appointed Head of the Egyptian Mission to Iraq, His Excellency Ambassador Ihab El Sherif, on 7 July and expresses its condolences to the family of the victim and to the Government and people of the Arab Republic of Egypt.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council also condemns all terrorist attacks in Iraq, including the attempted assassinations of diplomats from Bahrain and Pakistan and attacks against other civilian personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council emphasizes that there can be no justification for such terrorist acts and underlines the need to bring to justice the perpetrators.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reaffirms its unwavering support for the Iraqi people in their political transition, as outlined in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1546(2004).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1546 (2004)</a>. The Security Council also reaffirms Iraq's independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and calls upon the international community to stand by the Iraqi people in their pursuit of peace, stability and democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council welcomes Egypt's continued commitment in this regard, as stated in a letter by the Permanent Representative of the Arab Republic of Egypt addressed to the President of the Council (<a href="../pdf/S-2005-438.pdf" class="pdf">S/2005/438</a>), and recognizes the important role of Egypt and other neighbouring countries in supporting the political process, helping control transit across Iraq's borders, and extending other support to the Iraqi people."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-29.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/29</a>.</p>
