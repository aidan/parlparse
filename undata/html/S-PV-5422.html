	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council strongly commends and supports the efforts of the African Union to achieve lasting peace in Darfur. It reiterates in the strongest terms the need for all parties to the conflict in Darfur to put an immediate end to the violence and atrocities. It reaffirms its concern that the persisting violence in Darfur might further negatively affect the rest of the country as well as the region, including the security of Chad, and expresses its utmost concern over the dire consequences of the prolonged conflict in Darfur for the civilian population. It further reaffirms the right of the displaced persons to return to their homes if they wish to do so.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the African Union-led inter-Sudanese peace talks in Abuja on the conflict in Darfur, in particular the tireless efforts of the Chief Mediator, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, and his team. It welcomes the developments so far in the negotiations and urges the parties to make speedy progress in concluding a Darfur peace accord.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council further reiterates its endorsement of the decision of 10 March 2006 of the African Union Peace and Security Council that an accord must be reached by 30 April 2006 and strongly urges that all parties make the necessary efforts to reach an accord by this date.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council recognizes that an inclusive political settlement is key to peace in Sudan and that the talks provide a mechanism to achieve such a settlement in Darfur. The Council reiterates its call to all parties to the conflict to fulfil their commitments to conclude a peace accord in the interest of the people of Darfur, and Sudan as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council calls on and expects the parties in Abuja to consider, in good faith, proposals to be made by the Mediator, with a view to reaching peace, security and stability in Darfur, and Sudan as a whole. It emphasizes that working towards a positive outcome is a collective responsibility of all the parties in the conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council commends the various partners and stakeholders for their support to the African Union-led Abuja peace process and encourages them, in particular the United Nations, to continue supporting the parties in the implementation of the peace accord."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-17.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/17</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
