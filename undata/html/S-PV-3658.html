	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, <a href="../pdf/S-1996-284.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1996/284</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the interim report of the Secretary-General concerning the situation in Abkhazia, Georgia, of 15 April 1996 (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-284.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/284</a>). It has also read with appreciation the letter of the Government of Georgia (<a href="../pdf/S-1996-165.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/165</a>) and the proposals on the political status of Abkhazia contained therein.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council notes with deep concern the continued failure of the parties to achieve a comprehensive political settlement. It also notes the adverse impact that this failure has on the humanitarian situation and economic development in the region. It calls upon the parties, in particular the Abkhaz side, to achieve substantive progress without further delay.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reaffirms its full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Envoy and of the Russian Federation as facilitator aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict, including on the political status of Abkhazia, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia. The Council stresses that the primary responsibility for achieving a comprehensive political settlement rests upon the parties themselves.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council welcomes the efforts undertaken by the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as set out in <a href="../pdf/S-1996-74.pdf" class="pdf">S/1996/74</a>, annex IV, in support of such a comprehensive political settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council remains deeply concerned at the continued obstruction of the return of the refugees and displaced persons by the Abkhaz authorities, which is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council expresses its support for the Secretary-General's efforts to find ways of improving the observance of human rights in the region, as an integral part of the work towards a comprehensive political settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council notes the important contribution made by the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) and the CIS Collective Peace-keeping Forces to the stabilization of the situation in the zone of conflict. The Council recalls its encouragement to Member States to make contributions, in cash or kind, to the voluntary fund in support of the implementation of the Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces and/or humanitarian aspects including demining. It welcomes the contributions mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council is, however, deeply concerned at the deterioration in security conditions in the Gali region, which has a negative effect on the ability of UNOMIG to meet its mandated tasks. The Council condemns mine laying in the Gali region, which has resulted in loss of life, including of a UNOMIG military observer. Such mine-laying should cease. The Council calls on the parties to take all measures in their power to prevent it. The Council stresses that the international community's ability to assist depends on the full cooperation of the parties, especially the fulfilment of their obligations regarding the safety and freedom of movement of international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council invites the Secretary-General to continue to keep it informed of the situation."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1996-20.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1996/20</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
