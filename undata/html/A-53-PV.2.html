</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of the annex
to resolution 33/138, the 21 Vice-Presidents of the
General Assembly at its fifty-third session shall be elected
according to the following pattern:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(a)
Six representatives from African States;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(b)
Five representatives from Asian States;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(c)
One representative from an Eastern European
State;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

Two representatives from Latin American and
Caribbean States;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(e)
Two representatives from Western European
and Other States;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(f)
Representatives of the five permanent members
of the Security Council.
</blockquote>
<p>
In accordance with paragraph 16 of annex VI to the
rules of procedure, the election of the Vice-Presidents of
the Assembly by secret ballot will be dispensed with when
the number of candidates corresponds to the number of
seats to be filled. We shall proceed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
I shall now read out the names of the endorsed
candidates:
</p>
<p>
African States: Cameroon, Lesotho, Liberia, Morocco,
Senegal, Uganda.
</p>
<p>
Asian States: Brunei Darussalam, Myanmar, Syrian
Arab Republic, Turkmenistan, Yemen.
</p>
<blockquote>
Eastern European States: Georgia.
</blockquote>
<p>
Latin American and Caribbean States: Nicaragua,
Suriname.
</p>
<p>
Western European and Other States: Germany, San
Marino.
</p>
<p>
Since the number of candidates corresponds to the
number of seats to be filled in each region, I declare those
candidates elected, in addition to the representatives of the
five permanent members of the Security Council.
</p>
<p>
The following States have therefore been elected to
Vice-Presidencies of the General Assembly: Brunei
Darussalam, Cameroon, China, France, Georgia, Germany,
Lesotho, Liberia, Morocco, Myanmar, Nicaragua, the
Russian Federation, San Marino, Senegal, Suriname, the
Syrian Arab Republic, Turkmenistan, Uganda, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United
States of America and Yemen.
</p>
<p>
I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the
States which have been elected Vice-Presidents of the
General Assembly.

A/53/298, which contains a letter dated 19 August 1998
from the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences

<blockquote>
As members are aware, the Assembly, in paragraph
7 of its resolution 40/243, decided that no subsidiary
organ of the General Assembly should be permitted to
meet at United Nations Headquarters during a regular
session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by
the Assembly.

Board

the
United
Nations
Development
Programme/United Nations Population Fund and the
Committee on Relations with the Host Country to meet
during the main part of the fifty-third session.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Having been informed by the Secretariat that the
meetings of these two subsidiary organs will begin as
early as the first week of the fifty-third session of the
Assembly, may I take it that the General Assembly adopts
the recommendation of the Committee on Conferences?
