	<p id="pg002-bk03-pa01">At the outset of the meeting, I should like, on behalf of the Council, to extend our words of gratitude and appreciation to Ambassador Saïd Ben Mustapha, who will be completing his term in New York shortly. Ambassador Ben Mustapha has served his country with great dedication. As the representative of Tunisia on the Security Council, he has shown commitment to the cause of world peace and to the purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Through his insightfulness and profound understanding of international affairs, in particular as regards Africa and the Middle East, and his diplomatic skill, as exemplified by his leadership of the Security Council as its President during the month of February, Ambassador Ben Mustapha made an important contribution to the work of the Council. We wish him every success in his future endeavours.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">I wish to express my most sincere thanks to you, Mr. President, for the very kind words you have addressed to me as my mission in the Security Council is coming to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">I also wish to thank your delegation and all my colleagues -- current members of the Security Council and those who left the Council last year -- for the cooperation, understanding and the spirit of friendship that have marked and continue to mark our collective work for the cause of peace and security in the world. I have shared with you, my dear colleagues and friends, some of the most memorable moments in my long career of diplomatic service to my country, and I think such moments are also highlights in the careers of all representatives in this very important body.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa03">Indeed, the Security Council makes history, and we are part of it. I have had the honour, the privilege and, of course, the responsibility of representing my country in this body, and, with you, I have contributed to the consideration of many important issues and the search for solutions to the many questions of which the Council is seized. I wish to repeat to the members of the Council and the Secretariat my utmost gratitude for the cooperation and support they gave to me and my delegation during the Tunisian presidency of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa04">I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, and your delegation on the remarkable work you have accomplished this month, a month of abundant activity. I wish you the greatest success. The kind words you have addressed to me are clearly not only for myself, but also for my delegation and my country, Tunisia. I wish to assure you, Mr. President and dear colleagues and representatives, of the Tunisian delegation's continued cooperation in accomplishing your noble common task. Again, I wish you the greatest success.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk11-pa06">The Security Council will now hear a briefing by Mr. Hans Haekkerup, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. On behalf of the Council, I would like to welcome the Special Representative. Since it is your very first appearance before the Council, Sir, in your present capacity, let me congratulate you on your recent assumption of these duties. It is my pleasure to recall that back in January the Council was unanimous in welcoming your appointment by the Secretary-General.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Haekkerup</span> <span class="non-nation">Special Representative of the Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I will focus on the key areas of the activities of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and on the challenges ahead in ensuring the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">When I took office, I outlined the road map for the work of the Mission. The first goal was to move forward in drawing up a legal framework for substantial autonomy defining the provisional self-government, which will lead to Kosovo-wide elections. The second was to strengthen Kosovo's law enforcement and criminal justice system. The third was to create the preconditions for self-sustained economic growth within overall fiscal and budgetary stability. These tracks are, of course, interrelated, and all three must be pursued simultaneously. An important element in this is to try to engage the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities in substantial and constructive cooperation on issues of common concern.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">As the Security Council recognized a year ago, providing the Kosovars with a political road map towards interim self-government and putting in place the institutions of substantial autonomy following Kosovo-wide elections are the key elements in UNMIK's way forward. This is strictly in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Immediately upon my arrival, I therefore accelerated the process of defining a legal framework for provisional self-government, a key step in this direction. On 6 March, I established a Working Group composed of international and Kosovar legal experts, including representatives from the major ethnic groups. The Working Group is tasked with elaborating the structure of the future institutions of provisional self-government in Kosovo. It will also clearly indicate which powers and competencies will be transferred and which will remain under the control of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and will therefore not address questions of sovereignty. In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, the legal framework will not address or in any way prejudge a final political settlement on Kosovo's status.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">Seeking the Kosovars' active and constructive engagement in the definition of the legal framework is the only way to guarantee that both the process and the outcome prove successful. For this very reason, I note with regret the withdrawal of the Kosovo Serb member of the Working Group. For the Kosovo Serbs, full participation in this process and in the coming elections will be decisive as to whether Kosovo Serbs will become fully reintegrated into Kosovo society. This would pave the way for an improved security situation, a precondition for the return of internally displaced persons on a larger scale. Nevertheless, the elaboration of the legal framework will proceed as planned, and I will continue consultations with representatives of the Kosovo Serbs and with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">I will try to get as much agreement as possible through intensive consultations with the Kosovars and the international community, but at the end of the day there will probably not be complete consensus, and a decision will have to be made. That decision is my responsibility.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">The levels of violence in Kosovo continue to he unacceptably high. The general security situation has not improved in the last two months. In particular, ethnic violence is high in Kosovo, and the Kosovo Albanian population must actively support measures to stop this.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">There is a need for a strengthening of the law enforcement institutions. We are planning to bring the police and judicial institutions together forming a single new UNMIK pillar. This would ensure a better use of resources and tighter coordination, and it would enhance the Mission's capacity to combat crime.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">Kosovo's judiciary now numbers over 400 local judges, but the quality of the judges and their ethnic bias leave room for considerable improvement. Therefore, 12 international judges and 5 prosecutors have been appointed and are handling cases of a particularly sensitive nature or those in which there may be an ethnic bias on the part of local judges. There is, however, a clear need for additional international judges and prosecutors. UNMIK is still identifying the actual numbers required.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">In terms of law enforcement, the current level of support by UNMIK police needs to be maintained, and appropriate management, training and capacity-building for the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) should be provided, with the goal of increasing both the quantity and quality of KPS officers. The international community should ensure adequate resources to meet these needs.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">In the economic sphere, there have been positive steps in drawing Kosovo's emergency reconstruction phase to a close and shifting the economy towards sustainable long-term development. UNMIK has recently taken important steps in this area as well. The creation of a more market-friendly business environment has been at the forefront of our efforts. Regulations have been passed that establish a favourable legal and regulatory regime for the creation of new enterprises, while providing domestic and foreign investors alike with critically important legal guarantees.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa12">Kosovo's public finances are also moving in the right direction. Revenues generated domestically are scheduled to increase from 50 per cent to 68 per cent of the Kosovo consolidated budget in 2001. Increased reliance on Kosovo's own productivity and resources for revenue, coupled with sound economic development, are important elements for functioning public institutions within substantial autonomy.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa13">Unemployment is extremely high, and the economic situation for a sizeable part of the population remains very bleak. It is imperative that the international community maintain its current level of financial commitment for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa14">An important element in UNMIK's strategy is the improvement of relations between Belgrade and Pristina. Advances in this area are of utmost importance, not simply for Kosovo, but also for the stability of the entire Balkan region.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa15">It is crucially important that Belgrade formulate a new policy towards Kosovo. The international community must ensure its continued political support for engaging the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government in constructive dialogue over Kosovo. Belgrade must not only say the right things; Belgrade must do the right things.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa16">Constructive and pragmatic dialogue requires the opening of an UNMIK liaison office in Belgrade, and I have initiated this process. Day-to-day contact and close cooperation are needed in a number of areas and will be of benefit to both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa17">The Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has passed a law on amnesty. While this is a positive and long-needed step, only a minor part of Kosovo Albanian detainees are covered by this act, and close to 500 are still being kept in prisons in Serbia. This is perceived in Kosovo as too little too late. Belgrade ought to transfer all detainees to UNMIK, and their cases then should be reviewed according to international standards.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa18">In Mitrovica, parallel security structures must be abolished. UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) are now working closely with political leaders on both sides to find a solution to the problems connected with the Kosovo Serb "bridge watchers".</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa19">The democratic leadership in Belgrade is sending positive signals but has not yet taken sufficient concrete steps. What is needed to further the normalization process are two clear messages from Belgrade: one to the Kosovo Albanians, that there is a new, democratic Government in Belgrade that is prepared to take the necessary steps towards normalizing the relations between Belgrade and Pristina; and one to the Kosovo Serbs, that their future lies in Kosovo and that they should participate in the structures put in place to govern the area.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa20">Alongside the priorities I have set, out UNMIK is faced with security problems in the region outside Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa21">Developments in the Presevo Valley, while not falling under my remit, do not have a direct impact on Kosovo's internal stability and on the political process there. UNMIK strongly supports the international community's intervention and its backing for a negotiated political solution that will make it possible to abolish the ground safety zone.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa22">The extremist actions in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are also destabilizing the situation in the region. First and foremost, it is an internal problem, but it is important that KFOR and UNMIK support the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in solving the immediate problems, including by sealing off the border. However, closing the border crossings at Blace and Globocica does not address the problem and is unacceptable.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa23">The terrorist attack on the regular convoy from Nis to central Kosovo demonstrates that extremists continue to attempt to undermine the process towards establishing coexistence between Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo Serbs. All efforts should be made to marginalize those bent on destabilizing the area while guaranteeing the fundamental rights and safety of the populations there.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa24">In conclusion, we have to move the process forward. A precondition for a better security environment is the creation of meaningful provisional self-government through the elaboration of a legal framework, followed in due course by Kosovo-wide elections -- not the other way round. This involves, first, reinforcing law enforcement policies and procedures and the quality and efficiency of Kosovo's judiciary in order to better combat organized crime and those who aim to destabilize Kosovo; and, secondly, engaging the authorities in Belgrade in a constructive dialogue on practical considerations which concern both Kosovo and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa25">It is with these priorities in mind that, pursuant to security Council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, UNMIK will continue its determined efforts to build peace, democratic self-governance and growing prosperity for Kosovo.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Haekkerup for his briefing. I shall now give the floor to the members of the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">I should also like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Haekkerup, for the briefing he has given us.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">We are also grateful to the Secretary-General for his report. The assessments and conclusions in the report and the briefing we have just heard provide us with a good opportunity to look at the overall situation in and around Kosovo and to determine what further steps should be taken to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> in its entirety.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">We wish to pay tribute to the work done by Mr. Haekkerup and by the United Nations Mission that he heads in seeking to establish normalcy in the area. We also understand that Mr. Haekkerup inherited a rather difficult legacy from his predecessor. However, the first steps he has taken give us grounds for hoping that he will be able to correct the situation relating to the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, particularly insofar as concerns constructive cooperation with the Security Council and the establishment of close interaction between the international presences there and the Yugoslav authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">We note the steps already taken to open an office of the United Nations Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in Belgrade, and we believe that UNMIK and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will continue to operate in this way thus strengthening their mutual cooperation. Incidentally, in this connection, we wish to draw attention to one sentence in the report of the Secretary-General, a sentence that we regard as incorrect factually and politically. According to that sentence, in paragraph 64 of <a href="../pdf/S-2001-218.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/218</a>, "initial signs of the commitment of the new Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>" are only now emerging.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">That assessment does not reflect the actual situation, and I do not believe that I need to provide proof in this Chamber that it is not only now that we are seeing signs of commitment by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. In fact, we are all familiar with the many steps taken by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to implement the resolution, and those steps were taken under the previous UNMIK leadership. In other words, those steps were taken by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government when Mr. Kouchner was the Special Representative. But there was no reciprocal response to those actions from UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">There are still a number of important problems awaiting solution, and this is certainly not because there was no desire on the part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to cooperate in implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. I have in mind in particular the question of the agreements that must be signed by the international presences with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the status of UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR). The absence of such agreements to date is contrary to all of the existing rules of the United Nations. Nor has an adequate solution been found to carry out the tasks set forth in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> in order to ensure the necessary conditions for the safe return of Serbs and members of other non-Albanian populations to Kosovo and for their continuing to live there.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">We would encourage the UNMIK leadership to take a very balanced approach, in cooperation with Belgrade, in order to resolve the whole range of problems involved in preparing for and holding, the Kosovo-wide elections. It is necessary to ensure conditions for a truly democratic expression of the will of all the ethnic communities in the region so that they can participate fairly in the new provisional organs of self-government in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Rushing through the elections before the process of the return of refugees has become irreversible and before the proper security is ensured for all inhabitants of the area would simply strengthen the mono-ethnic nature of Kosovo and heighten the nationalist mood in the area, particularly in the districts populated primarily by Albanians, and this would happen not only in Kosovo but elsewhere as well.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">We have often said that before the election campaign begins there must be absolute clarity in respect of the concept of what is meant by substantial autonomy for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. As we understand it, that is what UNMIK is trying to accomplish by preparing the legal framework for the future provisional organs of self-government in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa10">Agreement on that legal framework must involve not only the various groups in Kosovo, but also the direct participation of Belgrade. We believe that simply informing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities about the process is obviously not enough.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa11">I would also like to note that in the Secretary-General's report there is a statement to the effect that the Kosovo Serb representative withdrew from the Working Group on the legal framework, supposedly on instructions from Belgrade, but as far as we know that statement does not reflect the actual situation, which is much more complex than that. I will not go into detail, but I would like to note that, in any event, there must be participation by Kosovo Serbs in the Working Group in order to make sure that their voice is heard.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa12">The final text of the legal framework must be approved by the Security Council, which should also take a decision on the timing of the holding of the elections. In this connection, I would like to recall our proposal that a Security Council mission should visit Kosovo. It could also visit Belgrade and, if security conditions so allow and the Yugoslav authorities agree, the Presevo region as well. In our view such a mission would be very useful if it were to take place before the decision was taken on the legal framework and before the elections. We would be grateful to Mr. Haekkerup if he could perhaps give us his views about this, including a possible time-frame for such a mission.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa13">We are particularly concerned about the situation in the ground safety zone in southern Serbia, and we therefore welcome the agreements reached between the Kosovo Force (KFOR) command and the Yugoslav side on arrangements for returning Yugoslav army and police units to that ground safety zone. We also note that, in parallel, KFOR is stepping up control over the administrative border between Kosovo and in the Kosovo sector of the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. Taken together, we think that these measures will be able to put an end to the illegal activities by the Albanian armed fighters. Incidentally, the decision on the return of the Yugoslav armed units to the ground safety zone shows, albeit somewhat belatedly, a recognition that ensuring reliable security in the region is simply not possible without the direct participation of the Yugoslav authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa14">We hope that in this explosive situation the Presevo Albanians who have made a commitment to this ceasefire will strictly respect that commitment. In that way, appropriate conditions would be established so as to implement the programme for resolving the crisis in southern Serbia, as proposed jointly by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa15">Recent events in Kosovo and beyond its borders show that Albanian extremists are calculating that through provocation and whipping up tension in the region they will be able to attain their own nationalist goals by force. We welcome the steps that have been taken, but we would like to emphasize once again that it is necessary not only to end such actions by those fighters, but also to provide a public assessment of terrorist actions and of the provocative statements that are regularly made by Kosovo Albanian leaders. We call on the UNMIK leadership to draw attention to the need to provide such an assessment of attempts to whip up nationalist fervour. We must all learn from the sorry experience of a certain overlooking of separatist tendencies on the part of the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa16">We would expect the UNMIK leadership, in cooperation with KFOR, to take additional steps to really achieve and complete the demilitarization of the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) fighters so that the so-called post-KLA structures would not be able to have an impact on the political situation. It is also necessary to put an end to illegal transporters' deliveries of arms. <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1160 (1998)</a> is still quite valid and applicable with regard to interdicting attempts to bring arms into Kosovo. Unfortunately, such activities continue. Of course, one must not forget that the weapons being used to whip up violence in the Presevo Valley and in Macedonia are coming out of Kosovo. Everybody knows about this.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa17">We are convinced that the activities begun by UNMIK and KFOR must be continued and stepped up. It is important to stop the expansion of this terrorism that is being cultivated by Albanian extremists, because otherwise the international community will simply be faced with the outbreak of a new and even more destructive regional crisis. We believe that the Security Council, pursuant to its mandate, must follow closely these threats to international peace and security in the region and must be able to take the measures that might prove necessary. In any event, we support the international presence there in its efforts to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, with the understanding, naturally, that a solid system of security in the Balkans must be based on utter respect for the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of all States in the region.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cunningham</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I want to welcome Special Representative Haekkerup to the Council for the first time. He has my Government's full support in his difficult mission.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We are obviously quite concerned about the violence in the region and its potential to disrupt and undermine what has been achieved in the past years at great cost of political and financial commitment. No one in this Chamber has any tolerance for violence or doubts the importance of the rule of law, I am sure. We continue to believe that the vast majority of Kosovar Albanians reject violence and are more concerned, as they should be, about practical issues of governance, which the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has addressed quite successfully in the first year and a half of its operation.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">In dealing with the Albanian community, we should extol those individuals, intellectuals and leaders in Kosovo, like Vetan Surroi, who reject violence and support the democratic process. We must roundly criticize those who are either silent about the taking of innocent lives or, worse yet, suggest that violence is acceptable. The latter must be under no illusion about the harm, and what they are doing to the aspirations of Albanians in Kosovo and elsewhere is close to being irrevocable. It has not gone unnoticed, of course, that American forces in the Kosovo Force (KFOR) were recently involved for the first time in a firefight with some of these violent extremists near the Macedonian border. This is a cause for great concern.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">My Government has been encouraged by the restraint in Skopje and Belgrade in dealing with the violence and by the reaction of Prime Minister Meta's Government in Albania, which has condemned in the strongest terms the violence in Macedonia. My Government continues to encourage Kosovo's senior leadership to be unequivocal in its condemnation of violence and to use its influence to help bring it to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">We note the recent statements by Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) President Rugova and the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) President Thaci that condemned fighting in Macedonia, but these are not enough. These statements are accompanied by articles in the newspapers of these and other political parties that label anyone who criticizes the perpetrators of this violence as traitors to the Albanian cause. This must not continue; it is irresponsible. Those who aspire to positions of responsibility in Kosovo must limit the influence of extremists and isolate them. They are not representative of Kosovar aspirations and that has to be clear.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">My delegation believes that, in fact, a large part of this violence is explained by organized criminal activity and I hope that the Special Representative will make this problem one of his priorities. My Government has provided support in the fight against organized crime and we are ready and willing to provide more resources to intensify UNMIK's efforts in this regard. We hope that UNMIK and KFOR will use all available means to apprehend those few individuals who are hiding behind grand political motives as a cover for criminal behaviour.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">We believe that UNMIK should move as quickly as possible in organizing Kosovo-wide elections later this year. Much has been said about necessary conditions for the elections and we agree on the need for a legal framework for transitional self-government, for all minorities to be registered and for there to be minimum levels of security. We do not agree, however, that these conditions must all be fulfilled before setting a date. Quite to the contrary, we would that argue that setting a date will galvanize the international community and Kosovars to make progress on these difficult issues.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">In that connection, we are cautious about the suggestion for a follow-up Security Council mission to Kosovo. It should be considered only in the right context, with clear objectives and at the right time. We would not want such a mission to distract UNMIK in a tense and complicated phase of developments in the region or to complicate efforts by those in the region to deal with these problems.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">We fully support UNMIK's efforts to improve its relationship with Belgrade and we look forward to the full staffing of its office there. Clearly, political developments in Yugoslavia over the past year have completely changed the situation on the ground, but these changes do not affect the requirements of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Yugoslav authorities do not have a special role in making the decisions that UNMIK and the Secretary-General must ultimately make about Kosovo's transition self-government.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">To be sure, however, Belgrade obviously should be informed. I mention this because it is linked to Kosovar Serb participation -- or rather, non-participation, unfortunately -- in the activities of the Working Group on the legal framework and even in the municipal Governments where they are not a majority. We reject the assertion that Belgrade's role in Kosovar Serb participation should be linked. If the Government of Yugoslavia is sincere about its commitment to renewing a dialogue with Albanian leaders, then surely it will encourage Serbs in Kosovo to participate in the setting up of these structures as a way of reconfirming commitment to the full implementation of the resolution. Certainly, the Yugoslav Amnesty Law was an important first step in creating conditions that would support such a process, and we hope that Belgrade will move to resolve the cases of those Kosovar Albanian political prisoners who remain in custody.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Levitte</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I should like, in my national capacity, to add a few comments to the statement that the Permanent Representative of Sweden will make on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">I wish at the outset to welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, who is on his first visit to New York in his new capacity. From the moment he arrived in Pristina, Mr. Haekkerup plunged into the important mission entrusted to him to continue the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> in all its aspects. We would assure him of our encouragement and full support in the discharge of his mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">As the Special Representative emphasized, combating violence, particularly that motivated by ethnic hatred, remains a central concern of the international community in Kosovo. The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), working together, have mobilized to take up the challenge laid down by the extremists. They are carrying out their mission with courage and perseverance.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">However, in order to stamp out violence, UNMIK and KFOR also need the involvement of all of Kosovar society. It is essential that all political leaders of the province support them actively and unambiguously. It is by ending ethnic confrontation, guaranteeing the right of all to security and safety and opening themselves to peaceful dialogue that Kosovars will succeed in join democratic Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We welcome the process begun by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to define the institutions of self-government in Kosovo, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We expect in-depth discussions to be held with the Kosovars. The objective is to engage them and to get them thinking about the meaning of autonomy, including matters relating to the protection and rights of minorities. This process must also involve a clear commitment from them to respect and implement all the elements of that autonomy. The representatives of all communities must participate in this process, including the Kosovo Serbs. At the same time, Belgrade must be kept informed.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">With respect to Kosovo-wide elections, we continue to believe that they will be useful to the democratic process and to the substantial autonomy provided for in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, provided the following conditions are met: first, the competences and mandates of the bodies to be elected must be precisely defined; secondly, satisfactory security conditions must be ensured; and thirdly, all minorities, including the Serbs, must participate in the voting. In this regard, we welcome recent statements made by Belgrade authorities -- Mr. Djindjic and Mr. Svilanovic in particular -- on the participation of Serbs in the voting. Those statements represent the right direction.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The elections can be held once these conditions are met. Setting a date a priori would be risky. We have every confidence in the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and will support him in taking the appropriate decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">The destabilizing activities that are being orchestrated by armed Albanian extremist groups around Kosovo cannot be tolerated. We very strongly condemn acts of violence on the northern border of Macedonia and in the Tetovo region. The integrity of Macedonia must be respected. We cannot accept the extremists' desire to alter by force the borders between Yugoslavia and Macedonia, particularly those between Kosovo and Macedonia. The policy of moderation adopted by the Skopje authorities must be supported. The Macedonian Albanians must also be offered every political prospect possible within the current constitutional framework.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">As to Presevo, we welcome the ceasefire agreement concluded on 12 March between the Yugoslav armed forces and the armed Albanian groups. We call on the parties to respect that agreement and to move quickly to dialogue on a comprehensive and lasting political settlement of the crisis. The international community must support that process, in particular by enhancing its humanitarian, economic and social assistance to the region. Humanitarian projects are already being undertaken by the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">On 9 March, the North Atlantic Council adopted a decision authorizing a phased and conditional return of Yugoslav forces to the ground safety zone, with the ultimate aim of eliminating it. This is a step in the right direction. We welcome the authorization by the Commander of KFOR, pursuant to that decision, of deployment of Yugoslav forces in Zone 1 of the ground safety zone. We are gratified that the deployment has proceeded without incident.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa11">We must thwart the extremists who, in and around Kosovo, are seeking to undermine prospects for reconciliation, peace and development. This is a shared objective of the international community. Whatever the causes advocated by these isolated groups, their acts of violence will not be tolerated in the Council. The presidential statement to be read out later will make this very clear. Mr. Haekkerup can convey to all of the democrats in the region our message of solidarity with them.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ben Mustapha</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">At the outset, I should like to welcome Mr. Hans Haekkerup, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Mr. Haekerrup's very first visit to the Council is taking place at a particularly sensitive time in the context of developments in Kosovo, and in a crucial phase for the region. We would like to thank him for his very clear-sighted and detailed presentation of the Secretary-General's report on the activities of UNMIK, which shows how far we have come and also how much remains to be done.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">Today's meeting is all the more important because it is taking place in the wake of talks that began earlier this month on this question. Indeed, the information provided to members of the Council in the course of visits by the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, along with today's report of the Secretary-General, has provided us with a comprehensive overview of the situation and specifies UNMIK's short-term priorities.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">In this connection, we welcome the fact that Mr. Haekerrup has decided to set up, as priority objectives for the coming months, a legal framework with a view to achieving provisional self-government before the holding of general Kosovo-wide elections, and to continue with the implementation of an effective law-enforcement system and the promotion of an independent and impartial judicial system.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">The achievement of these objectives will require the commitment of all of the communities in Kosovo as well as close cooperation with all of the parties concerned, including the establishment of a constructive dialogue with the Belgrade Government. In this respect, we welcome the fact that UNMIK will soon open an office in Belgrade, and we believe that an important step has just been taken towards establishing regular channels of communication, with a view to successful cooperation between the international community and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">My delegation welcomes the efforts to develop a legal framework for substantial autonomy, namely through the setting up of an internal Working Group. We are convinced that the active participation of all of the parties concerned would provide balance as well as a guarantee of success for this operation. We call upon all of the parties to assume their responsibilities and to cooperate within this group, with a view to implementing <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It is also important to ensure the success of the voter registration operation. The drawing up of accurate and complete electoral lists for the upcoming elections is one of the keys to the success of the entire operation and will provide it with the necessary support and legitimacy for its implementation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa06">We believe also that the effective implementation of the results of the municipal elections and the gradual transfer of responsibilities to municipalities would prepare the population of Kosovo to take full charge of its affairs, with a view to assuming total autonomy in future. Thus we approve of the efforts of UNMIK to set up an efficient, responsible and politically impartial civil service.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa07">We are also pleased with the economic progress that has been achieved in recent months in Kosovo. The transition from an emergency reconstruction phase to a new phase of maintaining economic stability is remarkable, especially if we look at the achievements that have been registered in the area of the management of the consolidated budget, the establishment of basic public services and the institution of a liberal trade and monetary regime.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa08">In order to maintain the gains achieved by the international community in Kosovo, we believe that it is urgent to put an end to the violence. The continued ethnic and political tension is seriously jeopardizing efforts aimed at reconciling the ethnic communities and is undermining the efforts of the international community. It is crucial that all the leaders in Kosovo work with resolve in order to eradicate the violence. Their commitment to a tolerant, non-exclusive and democratic society will be a example for young people and will pave the way for inter-ethnic reconciliation in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa09">Furthermore, my delegation is deeply concerned at the continuing acts of violence in southern Serbia as well as at the border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In this respect, we believe that the deployment of the Yugoslav army in the safety zone should take into consideration the concerns of the Albanian civilian population living in that zone. Indeed, we feel that this measure of trust given to the Yugoslav Government should be followed up with better cooperation with UNMIK, namely as concerns releasing Albanian prisoners who are still detained in Serb prisons and lowering tensions in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa10">The question of refugees and displaced persons is crucial in the search for a lasting solution in Kosovo. We must therefore ensure the return of refugees in satisfactory conditions, namely by improving security in minority communities. This question is all the more critical given that returns are often spontaneous in nature. In this context, we welcome the efforts of the United Nations agencies that are contributing effectively to meeting the needs of those vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Haekkerup for his efforts at this very delicate stage of the settlement of the question of Kosovo, to assure him of the full support of my delegation, and to wish him every success in his new duties.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Sir Jeremy Greenstock</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">We too very warmly welcome the Special Representative on his first visit to the Council and are very grateful to him for a pointed and very interesting briefing, which sets out the right priorities for the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The Permanent Representative of Sweden will shortly be making a statement on behalf of the European Union, which the United Kingdom fully endorses, so I will just briefly highlight a few points.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">Both the Special Representative's briefing and the Secretary-General's report make clear that the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) continues to make some very good progress. On that, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and his staff are to be warmly congratulated. But we have also heard from him today how difficult are the circumstances which UNMIK faces. The Mission cannot bring peace to Kosovo just through hard work. The people of Kosovo and its leaders must take up their responsibility for peace, along with all the difficult decisions that that entails.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">In this context, the United Kingdom has welcomed the start of consultations with Kosovo political representatives on the development of a legal framework for provisional institutions for self-government. This is an important step forward, fully within the mandate established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The establishment of these institutions is a key stage in the democratization of Kosovo which does not prejudge its final status. But we were equally concerned at the withdrawal of the Kosovo Serb representative from the Working Group on the legal framework. It is not in the interests of Kosovo's Serbs for Belgrade to block their participation -- and thus, their representation -- in this group. Such tactics set back hopes of establishing a cooperative relationship between UNMIK and Belgrade, so we hope that the decision will be reconsidered.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">I was pleased to hear about the high priority that the Special Representative has given to tackling law and order, which is a fundamental issue for Kosovo's future. We will support him fully in his efforts, including in securing higher numbers and quality of police and judiciary. The United Kingdom remains ready to provide additional international judges and prosecutors, if requested.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The situation in Mitrovica is a particular concern, and we support UNMIK's efforts to tackle it. The United Kingdom also looks to Belgrade to use its influence positively to help resolve that situation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">Another vital issue is the return of refugees. UNMIK is working with representatives of the Kosovo Serbs on the practicalities of returns, and to promote tolerance -- which is an essential condition for a safe and successful returns programme. This needs careful coordination and a step-by-step approach.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">The situation in the wider region, in particular in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and southern Serbia, is a particular concern at the moment. We condemn the latest acts of violence by extremist groups in Macedonia, which have no possible justification in a democratic society. The United Kingdom also calls on leaders of Albanian communities in Kosovo publicly to do the same and to work to restore calm. We support the efforts of the main Albanian political party to encourage restraint, and we welcome the positive and helpful statements that have been made by the Albanian Government. We also fully support the Macedonian Government, which is representative of both ethnic communities.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">The question of a Security Council mission to Kosovo has been raised. We would need to be sure that the potential positive results of such a mission were clear before a decision was made, and that the timing and the security considerations were both carefully considered against the objectives that the Special Representative has set out for us today.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Shen Guofang</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">First of all, I would like to thank the Ukrainian delegation for scheduling this meeting. I would like to welcome the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Haekkerup, who is on his first visit to the Security Council. I would also like to thank him for his very interesting and very detailed report.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">I have noted that Kosovo province continues to fact formidable challenges in the political, security and economic fields. It is certainly not easy for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to carry out its work in such a difficult environment. The Chinese delegation wishes to express its appreciation to Mr. Haekkerup for the efforts he has made since taking office to improve UNMIK's work and implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">At this time, preparatory work is being carried out for the general elections. Whether the elections are successful or not is directly related to the comprehensive and lasting solution of the question of Kosovo. We wish to commend Mr. Haekkerup for the cautious attitude he has exhibited in the preparations for Kosovo's elections. China considers that the elections in Kosovo should be carefully carried out in strict accordance with the framework of the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The preparations for the elections should also ensure the full participation of all ethnic communities. The work being done to ensure the return of refugees from minority communities -- such as Serbs and Turks -- and to provide security guarantees should also be intensified. If it is not possible to guarantee their safety, then merely encouraging them to participate fully in the general elections is just empty talk.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">China has felt all along that the strengthening of cooperation by UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is an important precondition for the discharge of their duties. We are pleased to see that since taking office Mr. Haekkerup has attached great attention to cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The positive and cooperative attitude shown by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also merits our commendation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">But we need to stress that the ultimate resolution of the Kosovo question should be premised on respect for, and safeguarding of, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. That should also be the case in the preparations for the elections in Kosovo. We hope that UNMIK can take concrete measures in this regard. We encourage UNMIK to continue and further strengthen its cooperation with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">The security situation around Kosovo has recently deteriorated, which has aroused wide concern in the international community. Ethnic Albanian extremists have been provoking violence in southern Serbia and in the border area of Macedonia. This not only poses a threat to the security and stability of the entire Balkan area, it also adversely affects the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Kosovo province.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">The Security Council already held several meetings last week on the deteriorating situation. It adopted a presidential statement and responded in a timely way. The parties concerned have been making efforts to resolve the conflict. The ceasefire agreement that has just been signed and the fact that the troops of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are re-entering the ground safety zone are both positive steps. The Security Council is once again today holding a meeting on Kosovo. It should send an even clearer signal to the separatists and extremists in the region, namely, that any attempt to use violence to solve problems will lead nowhere. We therefore support the Security Council's adoption of the presidential statement before it.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">We also need to acknowledge that there are at the moment a very small number of extremists carrying out rampant activities. This demonstrates that the measures taken by UNMIK and KFOR in approximately the last two years have not achieved their intended practical results, and that they need to be improved further. In particular, it is necessary to thoroughly disarm ethnic Albanian guerrillas, control the illegal flow of arms and strengthen the management of Kosovo's borders. There is an old saying in China that says that it is not too late to mend the fence even after some of the sheep have escaped. We have noted that KFOR is carrying out these measures step by step. We hope that those measures will really be able to curb the violent activities of the extremists.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">Taking into account the fragility of the situation and the fact that UNMIK's work is at a crucial stage, we support the proposal by the Russian Ambassador to send another Security Council mission to Kosovo. Of course, we would also be interested in hearing any of Mr. Haekkerup's views or comments.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yap</span> <span class="nation">Singapore</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to welcome the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, to the Security Council, and to thank him for his very first briefing to the Council. It was both informative and useful. Mr. Haekkerup has taken on a very difficult undertaking. He must be commended for the good work he has done in the first two months in his post. He has set the right priorities for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), for which he needs the backing of the United Nations and the international community. He can count on Singapore's support for his and UNMIK's efforts to fully implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> in difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">Kosovo's political status is clear in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, and all involved in charting Kosovo's future should move on. The overall goal must remain the return of Kosovo to normalcy. This would benefit not only Kosovo, but the region as a whole. Unfortunately, violence has reared its ugly head again in and around Kosovo, and in many forms: attacks against ethnic minorities and politically motivated violence in Kosovo, as well as violent acts by ethnic Albanian armed groups in southern Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">We welcome the ceasefire that has gone into effect in southern Serbia, and we hope that all acts of violence will come to an end. In this regard, we welcome the plans made and actions taken by UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as other relevant parties, to put a stop to the violence. We urge them to do all the more to bring peace and stability to the affected territories.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">The restraint shown by the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is commendable, and it should continue. It is not in anyone's interest that the violence escalate. The solution to an armed extremist problem is a political one, not a military one. We therefore call on the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to continue to pursue a peaceful political solution to the problems confronting them. Key to this are dialogue with the respective ethnic Albanian leaders and the implementation of confidence-building measures in southern Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">With respect to Kosovo, we would appreciate Mr. Haekkerup's assessment of the level of sympathy and support of the local population for the extremists and troublemakers. What are they using to gather sympathy and support from the local people for their actions? It would also be appreciated if Mr. Haekkerup could give us his views as to how the efforts of the extremists and troublemakers in this respect can be counted. Should UNMIK and KFOR embark on a concerted "hearts and minds" campaign in Kosovo? What should this entail?</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">My delegation believes that reconciliation among the various ethnic groups and building a multi-ethnic, multireligious and multicultural society in Kosovo is the key to bringing normalcy to Kosovo. In this regard, we reiterate our call for the quick resolution of the detained and missing persons issue. This would certainly contribute to the reconciliation process. The amnesty law approved by the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the release of Kosovar Albanians detained in Serbia prisons under that law are most welcome. However, we share Mr. Haekkerup's call for the return of all political prisoners to Kosovo, and we hope that the whereabouts of the missing persons can be established promptly.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Besides efforts to promote ethnic tolerance and reconciliation, there should also be an endeavour to stimulate economic development in Kosovo. The initial economic reconstruction measures taken and the progress they have achieved are encouraging. We support the shift in emphasis now towards developing economic sustainability. Economic growth would be a strong inducement for the Kosovo people to work towards a peaceful, stable and secure environment, so as to further build the economy.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">However, progress in reconciliation and economic development depends on the Kosovo political leadership showing their readiness to build a democratic, multi-ethnic society and a sustainable market economy in Kosovo as they take on the responsibility of self-government. The full participation and engagement of all ethnic communities in Kosovo in developing substantial autonomy are also important. My delegation therefore regrets the decision of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to withdraw the Kosovar Serb representative from the Working Group that is developing a legal framework for the Kosovo provisional government; this is coming when relations between UNMIK and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are improving and an UNMIK office is to be established in Belgrade soon.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">We would encourage the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to reconsider its decision. It would be appreciated if Mr. Haekkerup could shed some light on the concerns of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and provide us with his views on how these can be addressed. How can the Security Council help in this?</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">We would like to reiterate that Kosovo-wide elections should be held only when all the necessary conditions are in place, including the establishment of the legal framework, which we note is a view that Mr. Haekkerup shares. In stating his intentions to hold elections this year, Mr. Haekkerup has said that the election for institutions will be critical in stabilizing and developing Kosovo. But some analysts have commented that if the elections are misinterpreted as a move towards independence for Kosovo, this could lead to greater tension. We would like to ask Mr. Haekkerup what his plans are to address this concern.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa11">In conclusion, my delegation would like to thank Mr. Haekkerup for his participation in this meeting of the Security Council to brief us and share with us his views. We wish him and his staff well in carrying out UNMIK's mandate. They should be given full support by the United Nations and the international community.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Miss Durrant</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">The Jamaican delegation is grateful for the opportunity provided by the presence here today of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Mr. Hans Haekkerup, to exchange views on the situation in Kosovo. We welcome Mr. Haekkerup to the Council and thank him for his briefing. We wish him every success at the helm of UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">This meeting is timely in light of the recent tragic events affecting the region. Our discussions today take place against the backdrop of a changing political climate in the region, and we must bear in mind how these changes, positive or negative, impact on the activities of the United Nations Mission and the people of Kosovo. Members of the Council have recently had the opportunity to hear from most of the parties concerned, including the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Foreign Minister of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to meet with the Secretary-General of NATO. We therefore welcome Mr. Haekkerup's assessment of the situation and his views on the progress in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">While progress has been made in the economic and political spheres, progress in the area of reconciliation continues to be elusive. Nevertheless, the establishment of a multi-ethnic and multicultural Kosovo must remain paramount. It is important that we move ahead with the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, ensuring that the activities of extremists do not jeopardize our goals.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The Secretary-General's latest report, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-218.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/218</a>, provides us with an overview of the direction and new focus of UNMIK. My delegation supports the priorities identified by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General: the establishment of a legal framework for provisional self-government in Kosovo as a precondition for the holding of Kosovo-wide elections, the further development of an effective law enforcement and judicial system, and economic reconstruction. We hope that the establishment of regular dialogue with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the opening of an UNMIK office in Belgrade will contribute to the implementation of these priorities and will provide a basis for addressing other challenges, including the situation of missing and detained persons and the issue of the internally displaced and returnees, as well as organized crime and the trafficking in persons.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">My delegation wishes to reiterate its belief that the process of defining substantial autonomy and developing institutions of self-governance must be actively pursued within the framework of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We are pleased that the joint Working Group on the legal framework has started to discuss UNMIK's working paper and has provided additional input. We therefore regret the withdrawal of the Kosovo Serb representative from the process, because we believe that the representation of all ethnic groups is essential. We therefore urge the Special Representative, in his dialogue with the officials of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to stress the importance attached to the participation of the Serb community in this exercise. We agree with the Secretary-General that the cooperation of Kosovo Serbs is essential for their integration into Kosovo society, the success of future elections and stability in the province.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Recent reports indicate an upsurge of violence in Mitrovica, and we are of the view that additional security measures need to be put in place to contain these outbreaks. We are aware that Mr. Haekkerup has met with the Serb and Albanian communities in order to ease the tensions in this area. It is also important that UNMIK police enjoy the full confidence of both communities as they seek to promote law and order.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">On previous occasions, the Jamaican delegation called for increased surveillance by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) of the administrative border in order to put an end to extremist activities and to stop the traffic in illegal weapons. We have since seen reports that indicate the existence and use of large amounts of illegal weapons in the territory. We understand that only last week a house search disclosed an anti-aircraft cannon and a fire-thrower. We wish to know whether UNMIK police have conducted investigations to determine the origin of these weapons. Are we to assume that all these illegal weapons have been in Kosovo since prior to the establishment of the arms embargo? It is our view that continued vigilance to ensure adherence to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1160 (1998)</a>, which remains in effect and which assumes greater relevance in the light of the violence that threatens the region, is imperative.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">The developments in southern Serbia and on the Kosovo border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have complicated the security situation in Kosovo and make it clear that we must have a regional perspective in addressing the situation. We agree that the continuing violence remains the single most important threat to the attainment of the international community's goals. We welcome the cooperation between UNMIK, KFOR and the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In particular, we welcome the signing of the recent agreement on the Presevo Valley and the agreement with the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia regarding changes in the ground safety zone. We note that NATO and the Yugoslav authorities have agreed to allow Yugoslav troops to return to a small section of the buffer zone on the border between Kosovo and Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">We would like to urge consideration of the reopening of the border crossings. We appreciate the need to contain the violence but note that closing the border has had negative economic consequences for the people of Kosovo. We urge the Special Representative to continue his dialogue with the neighbouring Governments to determine how this can be addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">The conflict on Kosovo's borders has resulted in the influx of a large number of refugees into Kosovo. We understand that nearly 1,000 persons have entered Kosovo in the last few weeks. We commend UNMIK's efforts to cooperate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian agencies in the provision of temporary shelters and basic humanitarian needs for these persons.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa11">At the same time, we are pleased that the framework on the return of Kosovo Serbs was adopted in January. We must continue to work towards the creation of an environment conducive to the safe return of the Kosovo Serbs. At the same time, a number of Kosovo Albanians have been released from Serbian prisons under the new amnesty law. We expect that adequate measures will be taken to ensure the absorption of these and all returnees into the society.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa12">On another matter, my delegation notes that the report of the United Nations Environment Programme on the environmental impact of depleted uranium ammunition used in Kosovo is now complete and has been released. We are heartened by the news that there is no widespread ground contamination, although precautionary measures still need to be taken.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, I wish to assure Mr. Haekkerup and the men and women of UNMIK and KFOR of Jamaica's continued support for their work. We encourage them to remain steadfast in spite of the many challenges they face in assisting the people of Kosovo in achieving reconciliation and coexistence among the different ethnic groups and in providing the basis for their economic and social development.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kolby</span> <span class="nation">Norway</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">Let me first of all say how pleased I am to see you, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, in this Council. We look forward to working even closer with you when Norway takes over as Commander of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) next month. We would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">My Government welcomes and supports the efforts by the Special Representative and the staff of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), as well that of KFOR, to find solutions to the problems in Kosovo and to ensure the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">We welcome the initiation of a process towards establishing a legal framework for provisional self-government, as outlined by Mr. Haekkerup. Norway is of the opinion that the highest priority must be given to establish a safe environment for the minorities, which is a prerequisite for an acceptable solution to Kosovo's problems. Any attempt to reach agreement on the legal framework for elections, however well prepared, is likely to fail if widespread violence and violations of the human rights of minority groups in Kosovo continue. In our view, Kosovo Albanian leaders must take greater responsibility for actively preventing ethnically motivated violence and combating extremism and crime. Kosovo Serb leaders have the same responsibility, especially in the area north of the Ibar River.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">Strengthening the judiciary and law enforcement must be an essential and integrated part of the process aimed at developing a legal framework for provisional self-government in Kosovo. The lack of public trust in the law enforcement agencies and in the judiciary makes this an urgent task for UNMIK. We therefore welcome the priority given by Mr. Haekkerup to this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">We believe it is important that preparations for province-wide elections have started and that elections be held only when all necessary requirements have been met. Premature or ill-prepared elections for a provincial assembly risk undermining the stability we set out to bolster. The role and functions of a provincial assembly, including in relation to the powers retained by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, must be clarified first. Registration of voters, including refugees and displaced persons, must be conducted. Consultations between UNMIK and the Yugoslav authorities are essential in order to ensure Belgrade's political support for moving forward in this process.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">In elaborating a framework for elections, we must ensure arrangements that facilitate the participation of minorities and allow for their legitimate interests to be adequately protected. To that end, it is essential that the Kosovo Serb community be represented in the joint Working Group. We would like to take this opportunity to encourage Yugoslav authorities to use their influence to ensure the participation of the Kosovo Serbs in these important endeavours.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">It is of utmost importance that the elections be seen as meaningful. All provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> must be kept in mind, including the provision regarding substantial autonomy for Kosovo. The most important feature of elections is not to hold them, but what they result in.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Norway strongly condemns the violence carried out by armed ethnic Albanian extremists in the area surrounding Kosovo, which have caused the death of both Yugoslav and Macedonian soldiers. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries in the region must be fully respected and supported. Any action violating these fundamentals must be condemned. The Council will reiterate this in the statement to be made by the President today.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">All ethnic Albanian political leaders in the region who have not yet done so must publicly condemn such acts of violence. We believe the Kosovo Albanian leaders have a particular responsibility to reject violence and promote political dialogue. We welcome the statements made by the Government of Albania in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">It is important to recognize Macedonian security concerns. There is a serious threat to the stability of the country. We support the Macedonian authorities in their legitimate efforts to restore internal peace and security. The Government in Skopje is to be commended for their measured response to the activities of the extremist groups. It is essential that the security response is proportional to the challenges on the ground and is based on a broad domestic consensus within Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa11">Norway stresses the importance of the decision by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to allow the phased and controlled return of Yugoslav forces to the ground safety zone in southern Serbia. It is vital that confidence-building measures be implemented on the Yugoslav side aimed at creating a climate conducive to reaching a political solution. We welcome the cease-fire agreements signed on 12 March. It is particularly important that armed ethnic Albanian groups comply fully with the terms of these agreements, refrain from provocations and engage constructively in substantial dialogue. At the same time, we expect the Yugoslav forces to continue their restraint also after having entered the ground safety zone.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ahsan</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">We join others in warmly welcoming to the Council Mr. Hens Haekkerup, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The job of the Special Representative is by no means an easy one. He has taken over at a time when many of the gains achieved by his predecessor are at risk because of increased political and security challenges that the Mission is now facing. We deeply appreciate the comprehensive briefing he provided to the Council on the current situation in Kosovo and the priorities he has set for the United Nations Mission there.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">I would briefly mention some issues in Kosovo that we feel demand urgent attention.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">Organization of Kosovo-wide general elections for provisional self-government is a distinct priority. This includes agreeing on a legal framework which will define the bodies for election and their mandates. We are happy to know that the work for defining a framework has already started. Only the elected representatives in Kosovo, with full participation of all communities, will have the mandate to take decisions for the future of Kosovo. We believe that the democratic changes in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have opened up an opportunity for a constructive and meaningful relationship with Belgrade for progress.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">It is unfortunate that the security situation in Kosovo is worsening. It took considerable effort and investment to achieve some stabilization. The Council has strongly condemned the terrorist attack that occurred last month on a convoy of buses carrying Serb civilians. The incident must be properly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">At the same time, we also need to take a deeper look at the causes of such desperation. Experience has shown that the security situation hardly improves unless the root causes are redressed.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">We are concerned at the lingering inadequacy of the local judiciary, particularly, the ethnic bias among local judges. Alongside improving security, a very important task is to ensure a properly functioning judiciary. We believe the Special Representative will continue his efforts in this area, including through continuation of efforts to employ more international judges to deal with sensitive cases.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">There was probably no other way than to close the ground safety zone between southern Serbia and Kosovo, as it was increasingly being used for extremist activities. The incidents in the Presevo Valley have given rise to widespread concerns. However, the closure of the buffer zone needs to be accompanied by deployment of sufficient international monitors and by confidence-building measures. About 100,000 civilians reside in this belt. Their security and protection, as well as that of those living in adjacent villages, could be affected by hasty changes in the zone.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa08">We welcome the Amnesty Law approved by the Yugoslav Parliament on 27 February. This is a significant step toward healing the wounds of war and towards the building of confidence. All prisoners covered under this law should be released without undue delay. The rest of the detainees should also be returned to Kosovo, or the process will remain incomplete. We support Mr. Haekerrup's proposal that the cases of those not covered by the Amnesty Law should be processed through a judicial review conducted under UNMIK supervision. An intense effort should be made to find information about the missing persons. The release of detainees is an important measure for building confidence.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa09">The progress already achieved in pursuing the long-term goals in Kosovo by UNMIK is significant. This includes the development of a functional municipal administration through elections in October 2000, which now forms the basis of provincial self-government. The political leaders in Kosovo should demonstrate their willingness to live in an inclusive and tolerant multi-ethnic society. The international community also should continue to encourage and assure all Kosovars that they are not looking for an exit strategy, but are constructively involved with them in finding a final settlement of all outstanding issues.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa10">We are open to the idea of a Council follow-up mission at an appropriate time. We believe this needs further consultation. We wish to conclude by assuring Mr. Haekkerup and his colleagues in UNMIK of our continued support in their commendable endeavour.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01">In the interest of completing this meeting in time I would like to urge representatives to try to limit their remarks and not to repeat the points already mentioned by other delegations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valdivieso</span> <span class="nation">Colombia</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa01">As has been said, the security situation in Kosovo and in the surrounding area continues to be very worrying. That is why we regard the fact that General Carlo Cobigiosu, the commander of the Kosovo Force (KFOR), was not able to be with us today and we hope that he will visit us in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa02">We would like to welcome Mr. Haekkerup, whom we thank for the information he has given us. I will try to focus my statement on a few elements raised by Mr.Haekkerup and in the report of the Secretary-General, omitting comments on the security situation, since this is more related to KFOR.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa03">There are four aspects I would like to highlight. First is the strengthening of the local administrative structures. We applaud the achievements that were reached in the institutional and economic spheres. These achievements have altered the almost total dependence on outside actors, along the lines of what is stipulated in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The training offered by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to public officials who were elected in October and who are assuming control of local administrations has facilitated the process of administrative decentralization, which could be a guarantee for the establishment of strong institutions. We would also like to note programmes to boost the economy.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa04">In discussing the strengthening of local structures, I should also mention the importance the report attaches to the administration of justice and, in general, to the rule of law. We would like to draw attention to the complexity of addressing simultaneously such issues as amnesty, impunity, access to justice, the establishment of a judicial structure, security for judges and prosecutors, and a related topic: the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. In this respect, I would like to ask Mr. Haekkerup for some additional information on his proposal for a distinct and unified structure for the police and judicial systems, administered by UNMIK, as mentioned in paragraph 38 of the report of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa05">The second aspect is the establishment of the legal framework for provisional self-government. We feel that the decision to postpone the holding of general elections is wise. As we have said in the past, we must first define the scope of the institutions before the holding of elections. The participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in all stages of the process is crucial. That is why we regret the fact that the Serb representative has left the Working Group. Although this has already been mentioned several times, I would like Mr. Haekkerup to give us more information on the possible causes of this decision and to tell us what options exist to guarantee that he will return and participate in the process.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa06">The third aspect has to do with Belgrade. We note that measures have been established to build confidence, such as the establishment of an UNMIK office in Belgrade, the programme proposed by Serbia to solve the problems in southern Serbia and the decision that Serbian forces will begin to control a part of the territory of the ground safety zone. We are concerned by the risks that these decisions could represent, mostly due to the instability that we see in the zone. That is why UNMIK and KFOR have to continue supervising very closely the implementation of these new mechanisms in order to ensure that the parties comply with their commitments.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa07">The fourth aspect is how acts of violence are perceived. We would like the Special Representative to tell us his opinion on how these violent acts committed by extremists are perceived in the field. How much support do these extremist groups have among the population? How do they perceive the caution that is exercised by the Serbian and Macedonian armies? What is the impact on the population of statements and communiqués that are issued by the Security Council?</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa08">The resurgence of violence is a clear sign of illicit arms trafficking in this territory. We have to ask ourselves; what is the real effect of an arms embargo like the one that is in force? Where are the extremist groups getting these arms and munitions? We feel that this should not be overlooked. It is clear that the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1160(1998).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1160 (1998)</a> are being violated, and as a result the Security Council must investigate these facts through the Sanctions committee.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk02-pa09">In conclusion, I would like to express Colombia's support for the presidential statement that we will adopt following this meeting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Touré</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I, too, should like to thank the Secretary-General for his report dated 13 March 2001 on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). I would like to welcome the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup, and thank him for his very enlightening briefing. We would like to take the opportunity of his being here with us to reiterate Mali's full support for his efforts to find solutions to the many challenges remaining in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">Despite the many political, economic and security problems that UNMIK has faced in the past, and unfortunately still faces today, my delegation believes that much progress has been made in the execution of its mandate. While we welcome the tangible progress made, my delegation strongly supports the efforts made by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) Commander in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">My delegation endorses the priorities of Mr. Haekkerup, as set out in paragraph 2 of the report before us: the establishment of an effective legal framework for the provisional self-government of the province, the establishment of an effective judicial and law enforcement system and the rebuilding of the economy. We believe that all of this would help to establish a solid foundation for a stable and democratic multi-ethnic society in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">On political matters, my delegation welcomes the establishment of a Working Group, headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, entrusted with elaborating the legal framework for provisional self-government. From my delegation's point of view, the importance of this legal framework is fundamental because it will be the pillar on which to build the organs and powers of the future provisional autonomous self-government in advance of the holding of Kosovo-wide elections.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">For the elections to be held properly, some preliminary conditions must be met, such as the full implementation of the results of the municipal elections of October 2000 and the creation of a reliable voter registration list. The free and full participation of all ethnic groups is a major challenge that the international community must overcome, through UNMIK and KFOR.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">On security matters, my delegation remains deeply concerned over violence in the southern part of Serbia, the Presevo Valley and the border area between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo. We strongly condemn the violent and illegal terrorist actions perpetrated by Albanian extremist groups. We believe that ethnic extremism only weakens the Balkans in general and Kosovo in particular. It is clear that the violence that persists in the province represents the biggest obstacle to realizing the objectives of peace, democracy and prosperity sought by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">My delegation welcomes the signing of a ceasefire agreement on 12 March 2001 and calls on the parties signatories to abide scrupulously by their commitments. We recall that mindless violence has never resolved a crisis situation. It is only constructive dialogue among all parties to a conflict that can ease tensions and end a crisis.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa08">My delegation pays tribute to the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for showing restraint and moderation amid this escalation of violence in southern Serbia and northern Macedonia. We strongly support the peace plan of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, intended to end repeated raids by terrorists in southern Serbia. Mali is committed to the stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa09">My delegation strongly supports the specific measures taken by UNMIK and KFOR regarding the monitoring of the administrative borders. We are pleased to learn that relations between the new Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and UNMIK are improving. The opening of an UNMIK office in Belgrade is encouraging. Other specific actions, such as the return of the Serb representative to the Working Group on the legal framework, the release of all detainees and the clarification of the fate of missing persons, are also desirable. We believe that such measures would help create and strengthen confidence between the parties.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa10">One important aspect in strengthening security is to make every effort to ensure respect for the rule of law. We welcome the efforts of UNMIK to establish a reliable judicial system capable of providing sound justice to the population. It is equally essential that a framework for dialogue be established between Kosovar political leaders and the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa11">Finally, on the economic level, we pay tribute to the work done by UNMIK over the past 18 months and encourage it to persevere in the implementation of effective economic structures capable of establishing conditions for lasting, endogenous economic development in Kosovo.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Neewoor</span> <span class="nation">Mauritius</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">I will try to heed your appeal, Sir, and to be brief. I shall not comment on all the points that are relevant in this case.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">First, we are pleased to welcome Mr. Hans Haekkerup, the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Kosovo and the head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). We thank for the briefing he has given us on the situation in Kosovo. We also thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">We are fully conscious of the huge dimension of the work UNMIK is shouldering to consolidate peace, tackle ethnic violence, establish and conduct an effective administration and prepare Kosovo politically for the democratic process necessary to its autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. These are important challenges and we are satisfied that UNMIK is addressing all the issues efficiently. We appreciate the role of the Kosovo Force in ensuring peace and security, which are so vital if the work of UNMIK is to succeed.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">We know that there are extremists in Kosovo whose agenda is not the same as that envisaged under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. These elements will, of course, be involved in acts of violence and desperation in the run-up to the elections later this year. This should not deter UNMIK from implementing the mandate of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It is, however, extremely important that there should be maximum participation of Albanians and Serbs alike in the elections so that the outcome is fully credible and a representative legislative body may emerge following the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">We also believe that the Government of Yugoslavia should be involved in the process leading to the emergence of an autonomous Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In this regard, it is important to establish the proposed UNMIK office in Belgrade as early as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">Mauritius, as a multi-ethnic nation, has no doubt at all that a multi-ethnic Kosovo is an achievable reality. We would like to see the leaders of the Albanian and Serb communities in Kosovo impress upon their communities the need to be fully behind the UNMIK framework and to discourage the extremists on their respective sides. At the same time, UNMIK must take care to ensure that the administration and the judicial system are absolutely fair to all communities, totally free and non-discriminatory.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">Finally, I would like to assure Mr. Haekkerup that he has the full support of Mauritius in this important responsibility.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cooney</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for calling this meeting. We would congratulate Mr. Haekkerup on his work since becoming head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and thank him for the informative briefing he has provided today.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">Ireland fully subscribes to the detailed statement which will be delivered later by the Permanent Representative of Sweden, as Presidency of the European Union, and I will therefore endeavour to be brief and to highlight only a few points.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">Ireland totally condemns the continuing ethnically motivated violence in Kosovo. We welcome the ongoing efforts of UNMIK and the Kosovo Force to maintain stability, and urge political leaders in Kosovo to take more responsibility for developing a peaceful and tolerant society.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">We were interested in Mr. Haekkerup's comments about the improvement of relations between Belgrade and Pristina and support his view that the international community should continue to engage the Yugoslav authorities in constructive dialogue regarding Kosovo. In this regard, we welcome the recent adoption of the Amnesty Law and urge the authorities in Belgrade to take steps to release all remaining political prisoners. Progress must also be made regarding missing persons and the return of refugees to their homes in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">Ireland gives its full support to the fundamental priorities of UNMIK, as outlined today by the Special Representative, including the establishment of a legal framework, the strengthening of law enforcement and criminal justice systems in Kosovo and the completion of economic reconstruction. We believe that the electoral system needs to be developed further so that the elections reflect the will of the entire population of Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">We understand the impatience of many people in the region to push ahead with elections. We also appreciate the difficulties inherent in the preparations and, in this regard, agree with Mr. Haekkerup that the diversity of Kosovo's communities should be reflected in the joint Working Group on the legal framework. We therefore regret the withdrawal of the Serb representative from that Group and encourage Belgrade to exercise its influence to ensure that Kosovo Serbs are adequately represented in this process.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">Although today's discussions are focused on Kosovo, we cannot ignore developments in southern Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which endanger the overall security of the region. We welcome the commitment of Belgrade to respect the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and its initiatives that stress the need for a long-term, comprehensive settlement. To assist in achieving this, the European Union has decided to increase the number of its monitors in the region. We note the decision by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to reduce the ground safety zone and welcome the ceasefires signed recently with Serb and Albanian representatives. The parties involved should now begin direct negotiations and work towards defusing tensions in the area.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">We remain extremely worried about the increase of violence within the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including the most recent incidents near Tetovo, and we condemn such acts unreservedly.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">The violence which has escalated in and around Kosovo in recent weeks has many causes, including criminal activity. However, those who would seek to sow the seeds of violence in the region can find fertile soil in the political divisions there. In condemning, as we must, all acts of violence, we must not lose sight of the need to deprive such violence of the sustenance on which it thrives. Ireland takes this opportunity to urge all Governments in the region to develop confidence-building measures grounded on democratic principles, full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the equality of all citizens. Beyond that, it is also necessary for Governments to ensure parity of esteem -- that is, equality of respect between ethnic communities -- within their borders, so that all citizens can identify with and feel at home in the State in which they live. In this context, we would commend the stated intention of the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as reiterated by Foreign Minister Kerim in his statement to the Security Council last week, to continue its commitment to a multi-ethnic and democratic society.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01"> I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Ukraine.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">My delegation welcomes today's meeting as a good opportunity to promote closer cooperation between the Security Council and the new leadership of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). With Mr. Haekkerup's vast experience as a prominent statesman and political figure and the steps taken by UNMIK, we feel confident that the Mission is in good hands now. Meanwhile, it is clear that the current phase of implementing the Mission's mandate is not an easy one, given the persistent challenges to peace in and around Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">As we have stated on previous occasions, despite a new, favourable political climate in the region and encouraging tendencies towards general stabilization in Kosovo, the situation in the province remains characterized by a number of worrisome features. These include inter-ethnic and political violence, a lack of security for the national minorities, a high level of organized crime, an abundance of illegal small weapons and drugs, human trafficking, and so on.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">Against this background, we welcome the priorities set by Mr. Haekkerup for UNMIK's activities in the coming months. Of particular importance, in our view, is the establishment of a legal framework for provisional self-government in Kosovo as a precondition for the holding of Kosovo-wide elections. We welcome the establishment of the Working Group on these issues, which comprises representatives from Kosovo's major political parties and communities as well as international experts.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa05">However, the recent withdrawal of the Kosovo Serb representative from that Working Group has become a real impediment to the whole exercise. The absence of the representative of the Serb community in that Group could entail the risk of that community's refusing to recognize and accept the outcome of its work, and thus could lead to the abstention of the Kosovo Serb community from participation in the Kosovo-wide elections, undermining the legitimacy of their results. Therefore we call on UNMIK to do its utmost to encourage the Kosovo Serb representative to re-engage into the activities of the Working Group.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa06">Of no less significance is the implementation of other priorities of UNMIK, in particular the further development of an effective law-enforcement and judicial system. We applaud UNMIK police activities aimed at reducing ethnically targeted crime and political violence, and its success in developing the Kosovo police service. The efforts of UNMIK's international judges and prosecutors also deserve our appreciation. We recognize the special importance of the regulations on criminal penalties for human trafficking and on the authorization of weapons possession in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa07">My country totally agrees with the view that the establishment of a proper and regular dialogue and closer cooperation between UNMIK and the Yugoslav authorities will contribute to the implementation of UNMIK's priorities. In this regard, my delegation supports the ongoing development of a constructive relationship between the Yugoslav Government and UNMIK and the measures undertaken to open UNMIK's office in Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa08">We welcome the adoption by the Yugoslav Parliament in late February of the amnesty law that paved the way for the release of more than 100 Kosovo Albanians detained in Serbian prisons. While noting the achievements of UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), we remain concerned at the grave security situation in and around Kosovo. The dangerous developments of the past few weeks in southern Serbia and in the Republic of Macedonia clearly demonstrated in practice that the problem of Kosovo has a strong regional dimension. In the past two weeks alone, the situation in the Presevo Valley has reached a critical stage as a result, in our view, of the belated measures taken by the international community to curb the expanding terrorism, to put an end to provocations by the Albanian insurgents, in defiance of all efforts aimed at bringing security and stability to the region.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa09">In this context, we regard as a welcome and instrumental step the decision by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to carry out the phased and conditioned reduction of the ground safety zone and to allow the subsequent return of the Yugoslav troops to this zone.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa10">We were also relieved to hear the news of the signing, on 12 March 2001, of a ceasefire agreement between the Yugoslav troops and ethnic Albanian fighters. It was highlighted in the relevant statement by the Foreign Minister of Ukraine on 13 March.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa11">Today our major concern is the pending critical situation in the Republic of Macedonia, which has shifted from the border area with Kosovo deeper into that country's territory. We support the closer interaction between NATO and the Macedonian Government, and we believe that UNMIK and KFOR should intensify their efforts aimed at strengthening control and security on the Kosovo side of the border. In this context, we applaud the resolution adopted by the European Parliament yesterday calling on KFOR to act more resolutely and to use force if necessary to prevent the penetration of Albanian extremists into the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. I hope that the strong message in this regard contained in today's presidential statement will be heard.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa12">In conclusion, I should like to wish Mr. Haekkerup and his team every success in the discharge of their difficult mandate. In these endeavours, they can count on Ukraine's support.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa13">I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa14">The next speaker is the representative of Sweden. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Schori</span> <span class="nation">Sweden</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central and Eastern European Countries associated with the European Union -- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia -- and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta, as well as the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country member of the European Economic Area (EEA) -- Iceland -- align themselves with this statement.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">The European Union welcomes the visit of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Hans Haekkerup. We thank him for his most informative presentation on the challenges which lie ahead in Kosovo. The European Union also expresses its appreciation for the dedication and commitment of the Commander of the Kosovo Force (KFOR), General Carlo Cabigiosu, who decided not to leave Kosovo in light of the present security situation in the area.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">The European Union fully supports the Special Representative of the Secretary-General's efforts to ensure full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The European Union believes the approach taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General is the way forward to address the remaining tasks in Kosovo. We underline our firm commitment to a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa04">The latest report of the Secretary-General on Kosovo confirms that the number of ethnically motivated crimes, mainly against Serbs and Roma, remains alarmingly high. The European Union vigorously condemns the use of violence and extremism and any act which makes the coexistence of communities more difficult, such as the recent attack on a police station and the burning of private homes in northern Mitrovica, and calls on all leaders with political and moral authority to distance themselves from such acts. The European Union urges political leaders and local communities to increase their efforts to build confidence through constructive dialogue in good faith, and to make progress on issues of common interest. In this context, the European Union highly appreciates the central role played by KFOR and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in ensuring security and public order in the province, and its efforts to build a safe environment for all the peoples and communities of Kosovo. The European Union is ready to continue its support, including through UNMIK, to the defusing of tensions through projects supporting all ethnic groups and minorities and promoting long-term economic development and enhanced security.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa05">The European Union supports UNMIK's efforts to increase the dialogue and cooperation with relevant institutions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We welcome the recent steps towards opening an UNMIK liaison office in Belgrade and hope that such an office will be inaugurated soon.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa06">The European Union welcomes the recent adoption of an amnesty law by the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the steps taken to implement that law. We reiterate, however, our call on the Serbian authorities and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to find the appropriate legal channels to release all remaining political prisoners. Such measures would constitute a significant contribution towards the beginning of a dialogue between representatives of Kosovo and Belgrade.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa07">The European Union fully supports the initiative to develop a legal framework for provisional institutions for self-government, including adequate safeguards for minority rights, as the next step. The establishment of a legal framework, and in particular the definition of the functions and the powers of the elected bodies, is essential to ensure successful Kosovo-wide elections, in conformity with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. The European Union recognizes the importance of keeping all parties, including authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serb authorities, informed of the development of this process.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa08">A certain additional number of steps should be taken before the elections take place. There is a need to develop the electoral system further, including through an updated and integrated civil and voter registry which would include refugees, internally displaced persons and members of minority groups who did not register for last year's local elections, so as to ensure that the elections truly represent the will of the population of Kosovo. The European Union stresses the importance of a high-security environment for the voting and wishes to underline the need for further progress in the implementation of the results of local elections.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa09">The European Union expects all ethnic groups to participate constructively in the development of the legal framework and in the preparations for Kosovo-wide elections. In this regard, the European Union regrets the recent withdrawal of the Kosovo Serb representative from the Working Group on the legal framework. The European Union calls on Federal Republic of Yugoslavia/Serb authorities to support this important stage in the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and encourages Belgrade to exert its influence to ensure the adequate involvement of Kosovo Serbs in this process, in particular through the resumption of the participation of a qualified representative of the Kosovo Serb community in the Working Group on the legal framework.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa10">The European Union remains concerned at the level of violence in south-east Serbia. It welcomes the recent signature of the ceasefire agreement by Serb and Albanian representatives, which constitutes an important step towards security and stability in the region. The European Union stresses the need for the parties to abide strictly by the agreements. As a next step, the European Union invites the parties to begin direct negotiations as soon as possible and to put in place further necessary confidence-building measures to ensure the easing of tensions in the area.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa11">The European Union welcomes the agreement reached between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the reduction of the ground safety zone. The European Union will continue to extend concrete support to efforts towards a peaceful solution of the conflict. The European Union wishes to underline the importance of an increased presence of European Union monitors in the area as a useful contribution in this respect and has today decided to make available a substantial additional number of monitors on the ground in the next few days.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa12">The European Union is deeply alarmed by the recent clashes between Albanian extremists and the armed forces of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia near the city of Tetovo and by recent reports of acts of violence in other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The European Union strongly condemns the rising number of incidents in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and calls on all those with political authority involved in Kosovo, southern Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to distance themselves clearly and publicly from, and isolate, the forces behind these attacks and to shoulder their responsibility for peace and stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa13">The European Union supports the Government's policy of maintaining the appropriate level of restraint in preserving the political stability of the country and underlines the importance of a constructive dialogue between leaders of all ethnic groups for stability, pluralism and political and social integration.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa14">The European Union reiterates its strong attachment to the principle of the inviolability of all borders in the region and to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Recalling the importance of integrated border management, the European Union stands ready to support efforts by the countries of the region. A peaceful and stable former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- within internationally recognized borders -- is a key factor for stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa15">We note the importance of developments in and around Kosovo for stability in the region, as has been highlighted by the presentation and the interventions we have listened to today. In such a broader context, and in line with the Zagreb summit of last November between the heads of State and Government of the European Union and of the western Balkan States, the European Union reiterates its strong support for the forces of integration and cooperation in the region and notes the constructive spirit inspiring the heads of State and Government of the South-East European countries, as shown in the declaration of the recent South-East European Cooperation Process summit held in Skopje.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg024-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Calovski</span> <span class="nation">The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa01">I would like to join the previous speakers who have praised the dynamic, thoughtful and important leadership of Ukraine's presidency of the Security Council as headed by you, Mr. President, a very good friend of Macedonia and of mine.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">We are pleased to see Mr. Hans Haekkerup, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), in the Security Council Chamber. I have followed his briefing carefully and with great interest. The Republic of Macedonia, like the other States of the region, of the European Union and of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would like to see more security, more law and order, full observance of human rights, better economic and social development and, of course, much more democratic development in Kosovo. In this regard, we very much appreciate the efforts of UNMIK and the Kosovo Force (KFOR), as well as of Mr. Haekkerup and General Carlo Cabigiosu, commander of the international security presence in Kosovo -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led (NATO) KFOR -- who was supposed to be here today.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa03">From the contents of the Secretary-General's report of 13 March 2001 (<a href="../pdf/S-2001-218.pdf" class="pdf">S/2001/218</a>) and from what we have heard today, it is clear that UNMIK and KFOR are achieving important results in spite of the enormous problems that they are facing daily and that they will be facing in the period to come. As expected, we see that the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> is not an easy affair, but it must be fully implemented in all its parts. The political balance of this resolution requires that all its parts and provisions should receive equal attention. I am pleased to note the expressed commitment and readiness by Mr. Haekkerup to work in that manner -- of course, in very close cooperation with the Security Council, NATO, the European Union, the OSCE and all the States of the region. It should be clear to everybody -- and I would like very much to stress this -- that the failure to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> will be seen as a failure of our Organization and of NATO. I am sure that will not happen.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">At this very moment the main preoccupation of Macedonia is that Kosovo should not continue to be a source of tension in the region or a factor in destabilizing the region. In the words of the President of the Republic of Macedonia,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk02-pa05">"The security situation in Macedonia has deteriorated as a result of armed violence led by terrorist mobs infiltrated from Kosovo. These mobs are comprised of old KLA members, mainly from Kosovo. They aim to destabilise Macedonia through constant attacks on inter-ethnic relations and State structures."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">The elimination of paramilitary extremists' bases that have been established in the border area in order to penetrate Macedonia is an urgent necessity. In other words, Kosovo's security tensions and security troubles should not be allowed to spill over to the region and to Macedonia. The activities of the extremists were strongly condemned by the Security Council on 2 and 7 March, and by the Secretary-General on 28 February. But in spite of that, the extremists have continued their terrorist activities, have managed to penetrate into Macedonia and have engaged in armed attacks against our army, police and population.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">What we are witnessing, in effect, is armed aggression against Macedonia from abroad, from Kosovo. In this regard, I would like to stress what Mr. Carl Bildt, United Nations Special Envoy to the Balkans, said yesterday, that he is "very disappointed by the fact that a country which is a member of the United Nations is being attacked from a territory that is under United Nations administration". Under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, the duty to control the Kosovo border to prevent a spillover of negative effects from Kosovo lies with those who govern Kosovo: UNMIK and KFOR. Our evidence and that given to us by friendly countries points to the fact that armed extremists are Albanians from Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa08">It is urgent that the extremists be isolated and unable to proceed with their agenda and terrorist activities. That should be done by UNMIK and KFOR undertaking adequate military and police measures. They should control the border with Macedonia and should eliminate the bases of terrorism in Kosovo. It should be clear that the efforts of the extremists to undermine the stability, security and territorial integrity of Macedonia will not succeed. We will not allow that to happen. In this regard, I am pleased to express my Government's satisfaction that we have the Security Council's support. I am also pleased with the KFOR statement that:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk02-pa09">"KFOR has responded vigorously to the concerns of the Macedonian Government and has conducted robust and successful operations along the border with Macedonia to ensure that the Kosovo border area is not a safe haven for armed extremists inside Kosovo."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa10">All legitimate political entities in Macedonia and in all countries of our region and Europe have condemned the extremists' activities, the use of force and terrorism for achieving political goals. Now we have to see to it that what was said would be done will be. Among the efforts of the international community and individual States, the most important role, responsibility and task fall to UNMIK and KFOR, the United Nations and NATO. The Security Council, the Secretary-General and other concerned States or international institutions should help Mr. Haekkerup and General Cabigiosu carry out successfully this important task of stopping Kosovo from being a source of tensions and an exporter of security troubles and should help the province become a place of development and democracy and a multi-ethnic society of equals.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa11">In our view, that is possible. Macedonia will help UNMIK and KFOR without reservation or hesitation. It is unacceptable that the Kosovo extremist terrorists be allowed to destabilize the Republic of Macedonia, a Member State of the United Nations, or to jeopardize its successful democratic development and integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa12">It is important, in our view, that we see Kosovo, in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as a part of Europe. At present it has many difficulties, but it has a very good future. Kosovo, too, one day will be integrated into the Euro-Atlantic structures. That is Kosovo's future. Integration into Europe is Kosovo's future. But that will not happen if Kosovo becomes an obstacle to the integration of the States of the region into the European Union, if Kosovo continues to be a problem to Europe, if the Kosovar people are brainwashed with nineteenth-century ideas of creating a greater Albania, a greater Kosovo State or a pure Albanian State, or if the Kosovars are pushed to become criminals and terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa13">Mr. Haekkerup and General Cabigiosu, as heads of UNMIK and KFOR, do not have an easy task before them. But taking into account the human dimension of the task, it is worthwhile to work towards its accomplishment, on the implementation of the mandate under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. We sincerely wish them much success, along with the promise, as I have already said, to help and support them.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa14">As you have seen, Mr. President, our position coincides with those expressed by the representative of Sweden, speaking on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa15">But coming back to Macedonia's present concerns, I would like to read to you what the Prime Minister of Macedonia stated yesterday:</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa16">"It is a fact that for the period of one month now our country has been attacked by structures that have the serious intention to threaten its security and integrity.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa17">"At the beginning, we all thought that those were only activities of some criminal groups. But today all indications show that perhaps they have logistical and technical support by structures located in Kosovo. We do not know what their ultimate goal is, but we are deeply convinced that they will cause enormous damage to the Albanians in the Balkans."</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa18">He added,</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa19">"Every reasonable Albanian politician is aware of that. Those who want to create war in Macedonia should be aware that the Macedonian army and police will respond severely. We will ask for the direct involvement of NATO and KFOR troops in the confrontations. We are facing a special situation, but I am deeply convinced that we have no other choice but to defeat the terrorists. But it has to be a political victory and not a military one."</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa20">I have many questions to ask Mr. Haekkerup. Due to the time factor, I will take this opportunity to ask only one question, to make one specific comment: how will UNMIK and KFOR implement the Security Council presidential statement of 7 March 2001 and the presidential statement the Council is going to adopt today?</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa21">Specifically regarding the aggression -- and I use the word "aggression", which is what is really going on -- by the terrorists from Kosovo against the Republic of Macedonia, are you going to discuss this statement with the legitimate political leaders in Kosovo? They are in a position to promote the peaceful development of Kosovo, European views and standards and good-neighbourliness, and they are in a position to influence the leaders of the terrorists.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa22">Mr. Haekkerup, are you going to discuss these statements with the legitimate political leaders in Kosovo? They are in a position to promote the peaceful development of Kosovo, European views and standards and good-neighbourliness, and they are in a position to influence the leaders of the terrorists. Are you going to discuss these statements with the Macedonian Government? The Government of Macedonia is keen to see Kosovo start to develop as a democratic European society, and not become a danger to its neighbours. Are you going to take special measures against the extremists and, if so, what kind of measures? It is crucial that the extremists be disarmed quickly, without delay, and that they be isolated. Various preventive measures can be undertaken if there is a readiness to do so. Of course, I do not question that. I am sure that you are thinking of doing something concrete and practical. The implementation of the Security Council presidential statements is a very important affair; they should not remain solely words on paper, since they argue very strongly for the full implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa23">It is common knowledge that there are many armaments in Kosovo and that many illegal transactions are taking place. It is the duty of UNMIK to stop these illegal activities, which are financed by money from drug-trafficking and illegal funds from abroad. It is also important that KFOR examine the present situation along the Macedonian border urgently, with a view to undertaking further concrete practical measures to prevent a spillover of tension from Kosovo to Macedonia. I hope that General Carlo Cabigiosu is doing that right now. Perhaps this is why he is not with us today. I was encouraged, as I said, by his expressed readiness to do so. I will repeat: we really miss his presence here today.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa24">Let me end by expressing our hope that UNMIK and KFOR will discharge their duties and implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> fully and responsibly and that they will succeed in preventing the aggression of the terrorist extremists who are endangering the security and territorial integrity of Macedonia. Also, we hope that they will help Kosovo to begin a healthy development with a European orientation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Albania. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg027-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Nesho</span> <span class="nation">Albania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">First of all, Mr. President, let me thank you for the excellent work that the Security Council has undertaken under your leadership and for the commitment that your country has shown in the issues of the Balkan region.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">My delegation warmly welcomes the participation in this meeting of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Kosovo, Mr. Hans Haekkerup. We appreciate his observations and suggestions, and we are grateful for his engagement and efforts in the democratization of Kosovo and the establishment of necessary democratic institutions there.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">The municipal elections, the first democratic elections in the history of Kosovo, showed once again the full capabilities and capacities of the Albanians in Kosovo to create institutions and to govern a multi-ethnic and democratic State. The holding of the upcoming general elections will be as important and imperative for completing the whole institutional framework and for taking over the necessary self-governance and full control of the situation, in cooperation with international actors. We think that this important step forward will serve to improve understanding and to achieve the process of coexistence and integration of all minorities in a free and multi-ethnic democratic society.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">The preparation of a legal framework for the new elections must define well and clearly the institutional responsibilities and must implement the demand of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> for the substantial self-governance of the Albanians in Kosovo. The fuller and more meaningful the self-governance of the Albanians in Kosovo is, the greater will be their responsibility for achieving the integration of Kosovo in the democratic European family.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">We regret the withdrawal of the representative of the Serb community in Kosovo from the Working Group on the legal framework for Kosovo-wide elections, thus impeding the advance of the democratic process in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">The Serbs of Kosovo are an inseparable part of the process for building a multi-ethnic society in Kosovo. The Albanian Government calls on the new authorities in Belgrade to encourage the Serbs of Kosovo, in particular the Serbs of Mitrovica, not to boycott and sabotage the building of new democratic institutions and not to be used as a factor of tension, but, on the contrary, to be integrated and to take part in the establishment of joint democratic institutions there.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa07">We welcome the start of the release of the Albanian political prisoners, and we encourage the Belgrade authorities to release all the rest of the Albanian political prisoners still being kept behind bars and to make possible the release of information on people who disappeared during the war in Kosovo. We believe that a new and real democracy cannot be based on holding the political prisoners hostage, and it must have the courage to publicly condemn the monstrous crimes of the previous regime.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa08">In the future, the international community will be faced with the crucial issue of Kosovo -- its political status. We think that the solution will come naturally when the necessary conditions defined in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a> have been achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa09">The Government of Albania is of the view that the irreversible democratic processes that have been developed in Kosovo under the care of the international community, as well as the fulfilment of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> for substantial self-governance of the Albanians in the province, will be important factors for the integration of the Albanians of Kosovo into the European Union, under the supervision of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa10">Recently, there have been some proposals in the United Nations from concerned parties regarding the status of Kosovo; their true intention has not been to find a realistic solution but to find one that conforms to their interests. Any proposals that seek solutions within the old, conflicted, traditional Balkan schemes that serve the irrelevant national-domination interests and pride of States that, unfortunately, could not cut themselves off from the old nationalistic philosophy are very dangerous, provocative and unacceptable for the democratic reality that is taking shape today in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa11">The Albanian Government is pleased with the agreement achieved on Presevo and highly appreciates this act as a sign of the goodwill of the Albanians with regard to entering a new peaceful process towards achieving a political agreement that will bring affirmation of and respect for the rights of the Albanians, in conformity with international standards.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa12">We understand that the recent developments in Presevo are a continuation of the previous developments there and of the resistance of the Albanians against the persecution and genocide that the Milosevi regime carried out, not only in Kosovo but also in the whole area of Presevo. We do not agree that the use of violence is an answer to these grievances; on the contrary, we think that the only solution is political dialogue between the parties concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa13">The Albanian Government believes that the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are the prime organizations for bringing peace and stability to the region, and it strongly supports them. We ask the Albanian actors there also to support these organizations and to work for a peaceful solution.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa14">At the same time, we would like to see the international community engaged in the same objective manner in evaluating the factors that give rise to or provoke violence.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa15">Condemning the violence and extremism exercised recently, we have to understand that in the Presevo Valley there is a reality that creates fear for the future -- a point of view that regards with reservation the new changes in Serbia and considers that a solution involving enclaves and cantons for Kosovo as one that reflects conflict and instability. Furthermore, the lack of confidence on the part of all the Albanians, when they see that military commanders and generals who carried out genocide before in Kosovo are the same people who are today used to make peace.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa16">May I briefly quote part of an article that appeared in <i>Time  </i>magazine dated 19 March 2001, entitled "Red Berets":</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa17">"In fact, the new government has shown few pangs of conscience about Serbia's wartime past. Prime Minister Djindic recently appointed to the critical post of Chief of Public Security Sreten Lukic, the man who presided over the Serbian police during massacres in Kosovo prior to the NATO bombing. Now, Lukic, among his new responsibilities, is obliged to arrest and extradite two close relatives, Milan and Sredoje Lukic, wanted by The Hague for 'wilfully killing a significant number of Bosnian Muslim civilians' in the Eastern town of Visegrad between May 1992 and October 1994. The men are accused of herding 135 women and children into two houses in June 1992 and burning them alive."</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa18">Recently, there have been some very disturbing acts of violence and extremism in Macedonia. We would like to emphasize that the use of violence to achieve political aims is not only unacceptable but also condemnable.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa19">The Albanian Government thinks that the democratization process in Macedonia will continue through the participation of the Albanian Macedonians there and  through the better functioning of institutions, as well as through recognition of the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia, which they should be allowed to enjoy, in accordance with all internationally recognized norms.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa20">The Albanian Government believes that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia should be preserved in the interest not only of the stability of Macedonia itself, but also of the stability of the entire region.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa21">We believe that the acts of violence in Macedonia will be isolated and that the political process will have the advantage in the treatment of issues that have been raised by the Albanians of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa22">We commend last night's decision of the Macedonian Government to provide, in cooperation with the international community, financial means for construction of the Southeastern Europe University, to start the third programme in the Albanian language on Macedonian television and to provide financial support for the enhancement of self-government in Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa23">We think that recognition of all the rights of the Albanians in Macedonia as equal citizens will bring peace and put an end to this tense situation.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa24">I would like to conclude by underlining that the difficult situation that has been created should not be regarded as an attempt by certain groups or forces in the Balkans to create a greater nationalist State. The Balkan region has suffered from this illness and from domination by Serbian nationalism, which led to a real humanitarian catastrophe in the heart of Europe. Albanians are part of those nations that suffered the most. Unfortunately, this idea is still alive in some pro-nationalist circles which want to realize their ideas by using a democratic language.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa25">The new aspiration of Albanian democracy is its full integration into the structures of the European Union and NATO, and this objective has enabled Albania to work for the implementation and protection of the fundamental principles of democracy and the protection of human rights and of minorities.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa26">By sharing the same goals with other Balkan countries, Albania believes that this realistic policy will find roots in neighbouring countries, which should respect and implement the institutional rights of Albanians, whether they are in Macedonia, Presevo or Montenegro.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Albania for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Turkey. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg029-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Göktürk</span> <span class="nation">Turkey</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">Like previous speakers, I would like to begin by welcoming the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Hans Haekkerup. We thank him for his eloquent presentation. He has been in his present capacity for only two months, but he has shown remarkable dexterity in leading the Mission's operations.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">Turkey firmly supports the Special Representative in his efforts to ensure the effective implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. Turkey's substantial contributions to the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) will continue.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">The latest report of the Secretary-General on UNMIK indeed draws a tantalizing picture. We are, on the one hand, presented with a political outlook utterly fragmented on ethnic and agenda matters, the immediate result being the precarious security situation in and around Kosovo. On the other, we see a gradual movement towards normalcy thanks to the efforts of the international community through the pillars of civil administration, institution-building and economic reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">Kosovo is part and parcel of the Balkan reality. History has proved time and again that, in the context of the Balkans, exaggerated expectations take the fast lane. What we have been witnessing lately is, in a way, only a repetition of the obvious. One of the responsibilities of the international community is therefore to curb precisely that. And to do that, we should build on our successes achieved by the work of UNMIK in the course of its now 18 months of life.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">Ethnic harmony remains the overriding objective of our project. Provincial-level structures are now being articulated. A Working Group set up by the Special Representative has begun in earnest the drafting exercise of the legal framework for substantial autonomy. The Secretary-General, in paragraph 22 of his report, in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-218.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/218</a>, rightly states that "the overarching aim of the Working Group will be to ensure the participation of all Kosovo communities in the final definition of the legal framework", and goes on to say that "UNMIK is attempting to develop the broadest possible support for the legal framework before my Special Representative takes the final decision to move forward with Kosovo-wide elections."</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">Once this legal framework is established, the entire people of Kosovo will be asked to follow its trajectory. Therefore, now is the time for all communities in Kosovo be given the direct and full right to participate in the Working Group. We hence fully support the legitimate expectation of the Turkish community to be represented in this Group. This is in fact a prerogative of the Turkish community emanating from its acquired rights and status. These were confirmed and given operative expression last September, in the letter of Mr. Kouchner, the former Special Representative, addressed to the Turkish community. In his letter, Mr. Kouchner provides assurances, inter alia, that "UNMIK shall fully and fairly involve members of the Turkish community, as well as members of all other communities, in the preparation of future arrangements for the establishment of provisional institutions in Kosovo for the interim period."</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">The chances of the Kosovo experiment becoming a truly inclusive one leading to multi-ethnic harmony depend to a large extent on the latitude the smaller communities will enjoy in their daily dealings and in determining their future. This will also define the contours of the perspective from which the larger segments of the society view each other.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">We remain concerned by the recurring violence in south-east Serbia. The recent agreement between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the representatives of the ethnic Albanian community in southern Serbia to enact a ceasefire is therefore a welcome development. The success of this agreement, as well as of the agreement reached between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the phased and conditioned reduction of the ground safety zone, requires the cooperation of all concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa09">The recent eruption of violence in the northern part of Macedonia must be taken with the seriousness it deserves. The terror of the extremist elements can in no way be condoned. It is important that all involved in the region distance themselves from these elements. The Government of Macedonia has our full support in its efforts to restore tranquillity on its territory. Equally, all must contribute to the effectiveness of the measures undertaken jointly by the Kosovo Force and UNMIK along Macedonia's northern border. The territorial integrity and the sanctity of the internationally recognized borders of the Republic of Macedonia and other countries in the region are the common concern of the international community. The spiral of turmoil can be endemic, but countering it requires a much wider scope.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Bulgaria. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg030-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sotirov</span> <span class="nation">Bulgaria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa01">I would like to welcome the substantive contribution to this Security Council meeting of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), Mr. Hans Haekkerup. I wish him every success in the fulfilment of his difficult tasks.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa02">As Bulgaria has aligned itself with the statement made by the Permanent Representative of Sweden on behalf of the European Union, I would like to make only brief comments as representative of a country neighbouring both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa03">Bulgaria welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2001-218.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2001/218</a>. We commend the continued implementation by UNMIK of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> and would like especially to point out that the Mission began to shift the focus away from rehabilitation efforts to political and economic reconstruction. However, the Bulgarian Government is deeply concerned over the ongoing ethnically motivated violence in Kosovo. There will be no substantive results in political and economic capacity-building without inter-ethnic tolerance and dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa04">Being concerned with the security situation in the ground safety zone in southern Serbia, we welcome the ceasefire agreement signed on 12 March 2001 as a positive step in the right direction.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa05">Bulgaria has already had the opportunity to express its solidarity with the Republic of Macedonia at a moment when its territorial integrity and security are at stake. We consider that the stability of that State is vital for security in the region. It is of key importance that the territorial integrity of the Republic of Macedonia, within its internationally recognized borders, be preserved and strengthened. We commend the Macedonian Government for its restraint and for its search for political and diplomatic means to face the existing threats. It is encouraging that all responsible political actors in the Republic of Macedonia have supported the constructive approach of the Government and the President in tackling the situation.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa06">The recent provocative terrorist events, including the acts in Tetovo, however, aim to disturb the inter-ethnic relations in the Republic of Macedonia. Therefore, we share the view of the Macedonian Government that urgent measures to stop the escalation of violence and to calm the situation are necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa07">In this regard, the Bulgarian Government reconfirms its position that the political and material isolation of the extremists is of utmost importance in order to bring the conflict to an end. Moreover, in our view, the solution of the problems in the conflict zones along the border between the Republic of Macedonia and the Kosovo section of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is to be found in the active involvement of the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which should take all appropriate measures to disrupt the supply sources of the extremists and prevent the smuggling of weapons and military equipment over the border.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa08">The international community, including the countries from the region, should assume its high responsibilities for the stability of the Republic of Macedonia and should prevent further destabilization emanating from Kosovo. Bulgaria is actively contributing to peace and security in south-eastern Europe. In this context we are rendering military and technical assistance to the Republic of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk02-pa09">I would like to assure the Council that the Bulgarian Government will further support any concrete steps for the full implementation of Security council <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, including the endeavours undertaken by Mr. Haekkerup and his staff, and will spare no effort in continuing and developing its active role in promoting regional stability and cooperation.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of Yugoslavia.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg031-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mladenovi</span> <span class="nation">Yugoslavia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa01">I would like to thank Mr. Hans Haekkerup, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), for his very informative statement. I would also like to welcome the latest report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa02">Since Mr. Hans Haekkerup's assumption of the post of Special Representative, a new phase has emerged in the work of the international civil presence in Kosovo and Metohija, the autonomous province of the Yugoslav constituent Republic of Serbia and, it seems, in its relations with the newly elected democratic Government. A process of cooperation has begun. Contacts and talks at all levels have multiplied, and a possibility has recently been provided for direct communications with representatives of UNMIK in Belgrade. My Government is willing to further develop and improve that cooperation and stands ready to conclude an agreement on the status of UNMIK that would resolve a number of outstanding questions.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa03">The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is committed to full and consistent implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It will persist in its quest for peaceful political solutions to all problems in Kosovo and Metohija. The Security Council resolution renders a clear framework and provides for full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The position of Yugoslavia regarding the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a> was elaborated in greater detail by Prime Minister Zoran Zizi in his recent address to the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa04">Following the democratic changes, the Government of my country has been constructively cooperating with the international community. It is high time that other involved actors interested in a peaceful and political solution directed their efforts towards overcoming the current serious problems in Kosovo and Metohija.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa05">Here I primarily have in mind the establishment of a secure environment for all residents of Kosovo and Metohija, irrespective of their national or religious affiliation; a vigorous suppression of extremism and terrorism; the creation of conditions for the return of expellees and displaced persons; and the taking of effective measures to trace missing and abducted persons in the period since the arrival of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and UNMIK in this Serbian province.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa06">I have to point out that we are still waiting for this to happen and that the present situation in Kosovo and Metohija is unacceptable for my Government. Regrettably, KFOR and UNMIK are far from fulfilling the mandate entrusted to them by the Security Council in its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. It is a fact that no secure environment for all residents of the province has been ensured. Through the adoption of a series of measures and/or the taking of or failure to take actions, the clear provisions of the resolution regarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have been brought into question. The latest escalation of terrorism by ethnic Albanian extremists, the victims of which are primarily Serbs and other non-Albanians, once again provides ample evidence that extremist Albanian groups have not been demilitarized. Terrorists continue to be recruited and armed. They are active not only in Kosovo and Metohija, but also in southern Serbia, inside and outside the ground safety zone, as well as in neighbouring Macedonia. The latest dramatic developments have demonstrated that the Yugoslav border in the area of Kosovo and Metohija near Albania and Macedonia continues to be very penetrable and that it is necessary that KFOR and UNMIK take more effective measures to control it. All this has contributed to the deterioration of the situation in and around Kosovo and Metohija and to the impediment of the return of expelled Serbs and other non-Albanians, short of which there can be no multi-ethnic Kosovo and Metohija and no lasting political solution.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa07">Regarding Kosovo-wide elections, my Government considers that, prior to holding them, it is necessary to create an appropriate environment. This means first and foremost the return to Kosovo and Metohija of all expelled and displaced persons, as well as the exact determination of the bodies for which elections will be held and their competencies -- that is, to establish a legal framework. We are very interested in making a contribution to this effort. The Government of my country is resolved to cooperate with all interested parties, in particular KFOR and UNMIK, in addressing all relevant issues. For our part, we have been active in promoting confidence-building measures. The recent adoption of the Amnesty Law is just one example in that context.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa08">Let me take this opportunity to draw the Council's attention to the latest developments related to the situation in Kosovo and Metohija. The recent agreement on a ceasefire in the ground safety zone in southern Serbia and the agreement between the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and KFOR on the entry of Yugoslav forces into the part of the zone bordering Macedonia constitute the first positive steps towards overcoming the crisis, which is fraught with serious threats to peace and stability in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa09">Although these threats have not yet been removed, the Government of my country considers that conditions have been created for the full implementation of the Security Council's repeated requests to end the violence immediately and to have armed Albanian groups disbanded, disarmed and withdrawn from the ground safety zone. Those groups will otherwise continue to pose a serious threat to the safety and security of the population and to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Furthermore, steps towards a gradual and complete elimination of the ground safety zone would contribute to a comprehensive implementation of the plan and programme of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the ground safety zone and southern Serbia, of which I informed the Security Council at its meeting on 13 February 2001.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa10">The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia expects the Security Council to render unanimous support to these constructive efforts in order to implement the plan and programme in their entirety and thus remove the risk of further conflagration and threats to peace and security in the region. We believe that the Security Council will send a clear message to all those who seek to solve problems by resorting to extremism and terrorism that such an approach will not be tolerated and that it will be met with the strong condemnation and resolute actions of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk02-pa11">Before concluding, I would just like to say that today's meeting of the Security Council is not the appropriate place to read and respond to newspaper articles, so I will refrain from commenting on the accusations made earlier.</p>

	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa02">First, on the legal framework, a question was raised by the Ambassador of Singapore about its being step to independence. I think that we have been very careful, in dealing with the legal framework, to make it clear that it does not prejudice the final political settlement. It is important for us that we stay within <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. This means that questions that have to do with sovereignty and the final political settlement should not be addressed. They should simply be left out. The way we will do this is that those powers that are associated with the sovereignty question will be reserve powers of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General until a final political settlement has been found. I think I can confirm that this is not a step to independence. On the other hand, I think it is a very important step that might facilitate a final political settlement.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa03">The question about returns of the internally displaced persons -- Kosovo Serbs now living in Serbia proper -- is a very important question. As members know, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the United Nations are committed to the return of the displaced persons. On the other hand, this cannot be done on a larger scale until the security situation is right. Our job is to try to move towards that situation. A study on returns has been made and, actually, just to return a few thousand would demand another 1,000 soldiers of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) to protect them. As the security situation is today, they can be protected only in enclaves under the protection of security forces, which means KFOR. So there are very strong limitations on the possibility of returns now. The real job is to establish the preconditions for returns on a large scale later.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa04">When it comes to the question of elections, it has been very important for us to underline that the cut-off day -- that means, the date when people have left Kosovo -- for the possibility of voting should be set at 1 January 1998. This means that a large number of internally displaced persons in Serbia will be able to participate in the elections. We are engaging right now with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in trying to find a way to organize registration and participation of the internally displaced persons in the elections. We think that this is a very important element and sends a strong signal that we see their ability to return to Kosovo as a future goal.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa05">I would especially thank the representative of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for his words about our cooperation. I think it is very important that there be direct consultations between authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and UNMIK. I would also like to join the members here who have deplored the withdrawal of the Kosovo Serbs from participation in the Working Group in saying that we would like to see a resumption of their participation in the Group. I would also like to say, however, that whether or not that happens, it will not be decisive. We would consult with the Yugoslav authorities on these questions in any case. As has also been underlined, we have opened the necessary channels to do that through the UNMIK office in Belgrade. As members know, there is also a representative of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo. This is the other channel, but certainly we would also use direct channels and meet with the representatives of the Yugoslav Government to make sure that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is part of this process.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa06">There was a question about the final text, when the Working Group finishes its work, and I would like to stress again, as the Secretary-General has stated in his report, that I will have to make the final decision if there is not total agreement in the Working Group on the legal framework.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa07">It has also been underlined that setting the date for the elections is important. The United States underlined that point, and I agree. As soon as the legal framework is in place, I think that I should make a decision on the date of the elections. Doing so will be important for the Kosovo Albanians. The idea of elections is that they should have elected representatives who can speak for them -- of course, within <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. But I think that it is very important that we take that step.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa08">I also believe that there is a certain paralysis in the political climate in Kosovo, waiting for the elections. I think that after the elections we might see more movement in the positions of the representatives of the Kosovo Albanians. So I think that there are good reasons for pressing for the elections as soon as possible, but first the legal framework must be in place, because, as has been underlined by many members of the Council, we have to have a precise definition of the bodies that we are going to elect and the powers that are associated with those bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa09">I will do my utmost to ensure that all minorities and communities participate in the elections, and that participation is as wide as possible. On the other hand, I think that we have to say that even if some minorities do not participate, we should go forward with the elections anyway. But we will do our utmost to avoid that situation. We think that everyone should be on board, if possible.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa10">Lastly, there was a question about the security situation as a condition for the elections. Of course, the security situation cannot be such that elections cannot be held, but I do not think that will be the case. I really see elections the other way around -- that that will be a precondition for a better security situation in future. I think that it is important, therefore, that we move on when we have the legal framework in place.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa11">I should also like to say a few words about the comments made on our cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I have already underlined the fact that we want to open the channels. We stated up front that we wanted the UNMIK office in Belgrade, and we think that an arrangement has already been found to establish it.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa12">Concerning the status of the mission agreement for UNMIK and KFOR, I do not think that this is an actual question that we have to deal with.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa13">However, I would like once again to support what has already been said, especially by the United States, regarding the fact that Kosovo Serb participation is essential in the process that we are now starting. We are appealing for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to do everything in its power to make sure that we achieve this goal and to support participation, first, of course, in developing the legal framework, but afterwards to induce  the Kosovo Serbs to register, participate in the elections and take their seats in the municipal assemblies and, of course, after the elections, in the Kosovo assembly. I see this as a process, and I think it is very important. Mitrovica was mentioned by Jamaica. It is just one aspect of the whole process, but I think it is very important that we get this process moving, because many of the things we wish to do are dependent on the small steps that we are taking now to start the process. I am very much looking forward to cooperating closely with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on getting that process moving, because I think that it is a precondition for all of the things we want to achieve.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa14">On the amnesty law, several countries underlined that they welcomed the steps that have already been taken, but also emphasized that we have to move further, making sure that the political prisoners are returned to Kosovo. We are certainly ready to review the case according to international standards, if that could be part of a solution. But also, I think that the return of the detainees is a precondition for moving on a very important question that also has been underlined by many countries here, namely the question of missing persons. Here I think that both the Kosovo Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians have a very strong interest in finding out the truth, and that will not be possible unless there is very close cooperation between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and UNMIK.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa15">There were comments on Presevo and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I have to say that since this is not in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>, it is not a direct UNMIK responsibility. But I would, of course, like to underline -- as Colombia also said -- that there is a risk of spillover in these situations into Kosovo, as there might be some links from Kosovo into Serbia proper and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Therefore I think that it is important that we address these questions, and I would like to underline that UNMIK and KFOR want to cooperate closely in dealing with these issues. We also look forward, as Ireland mentioned, to cooperation with European Union monitors in finding a solution to this question. I think that first and foremost it has to be a political solution, but it should be backed up by power. I think that is important for resolving this question, and I can assure the Council that KFOR, as it has assured me, will do its utmost to contribute to this process.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa16">Concerning the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it is the same as with Presevo. UNMIK and KFOR are committed to trying to contribute to a solution. We think that first and foremost it has to be a political solution, but at the same time KFOR will have the job of sealing off the border, to the extent possible. KFOR is doing that, and should do that, in close cooperation with the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa17">It is also important for UNMIK to bring pressure to bear on the Kosovo Albanian political leaders to condemn  the extremist actions in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. But I think it is very important that, throughout Kosovo society, condemnation of the extremists be widespread and strong. But for us it is also a question of avoiding any sort of spillover of a situation, also in the form of refugees, as was mentioned as well. We are certainly prepared to try to solve that part of the job. But first and foremost we must avoid creating streams of refugees into Kosovo, and we will certainly try to contribute to that.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa18">I should like also to mention the border crossings, because I think that it is very important to seal off the border. For Kosovo, the border crossings at Blace and the road to Tetevo are the lifeline for the economy. This means that closing the border crossings really does not hit any terrorists or extremist action, I think, but has a very great impact on ordinary citizens and people in Kosovo and their economic possibilities. Therefore I would certainly appeal to the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to open the two border crossings again.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa19">I would also like to say a few words about crime and law enforcement. The United States of America underlined, as did other countries, including Colombia, the need to address organized crime. It is very high on our list of priorities. A special unit has been created to gather the necessary intelligence on organized crime. I do not think organized crime is particular to Kosovo, actually. It is international and knows no borders. I am sure that one of the lines of communication -- of goods and other things -- goes through Kosovo, and it is very important that we try to address that. I am very glad for the support that we are getting in this respect. But I also have to tell the Council that it should not expect quick results because fighting organized crime, as some of the members of the Council know, is a very complex thing. Getting the right structures in place now will be important to our chances in the future. Terrorism certainly does not affect only Kosovo, but also the rest of the Balkans and Europe.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa20">I am also thankful to those countries supporting the idea of additional international judges and prosecutors.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa21">A question was raised about weapons. I can assure the Council that there are too many weapons in Kosovo, and we are certainly trying to address that. I think many of those weapons predate the conflict -- especially with regard to the anti-aircraft gun mentioned by the representative of Jamaica that was confiscated the other day. I do not think this involves the weapons that have arrived lately. Nevertheless, we certainly should address this.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa22">There is a proliferation of small arms, not only in Kosovo but in the region, and we should try to do our utmost to stop it. We have therefore passed a regulation on weapons and have started a system whereby people will have to have weapon permits. We have included an amnesty period, but when that period ends, people who are actually found with weapons will be subject to very severe sentences, especially if they have a considerable number of weapons. Basically, I do not think that there is any great trafficking in heavy weapons through Kosovo, but with regard to small weapons, I think that there is.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa23">Colombia also had a question about strengthening the law enforcement pillar. What we have really tried to do is to get closer cooperation and better use of resources. But we are also trying to specialize the police and the judiciary and to fight more complicated crimes, as I have already touched upon.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa24">As the representative of Ukraine mentioned, human trafficking is one of the areas in which we have also passed a regulation. We have already had some results in repatriating people.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa25">I would also like to say a few words about the Kosovo Albanians. I have already touched upon this. I think the representative of the United States of America used very strong words. This is important. I have said it already, but I will repeat it to the leaders of Kosovo Albanians: they have to come out clearly -- and I think they have done so -- and get the message through to their people that what we should do is to isolate terrorism.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa26">There was a question asked by, I believe, either Colombia or Singapore about how many local Kosovo Albanians support the extremists. I must say that I think that number is very few. But the number is large enough to make it possible for them to operate -- and that is a problem. We must arrive at a situation where there the supporters are so few that Kosovo Albanians will report on their activities and make sure that they are stopped. I hope that the things that are happening now will actually push things more in that direction than they already are, simply because there is a growing recognition that what is going on in the region as such -- those extremist actions -- is certainly not in the interests of Kosovo Albanians. There is a growing recognition of that.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa27">Singapore and Jamaica also raised the question of reconciliation. I think that is one of the things that has been missing. Clear statements about the criminal activities that were committed in the past could lead to reconciliation. I think this is one of the areas where we should be working. As the representative of Bangladesh mentioned, the question of missing persons could be a very important step here because those communities have a very strong interest in dealing with this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg032-bk02-pa28">Finally, there was a question about a Security Council visit to Kosovo. I would like to say that I would welcome such a visit at an appropriate time. Of course, we must look at the security situation. It is also clear that such a visit should be helpful in addressing the implementation of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1244(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1244 (1999)</a>. As the Council knows, we must look at the situation. Right now the security situation is difficult, and therefore the dates and the itinerary should be carefully considered. I think we should work on the possibility when the situation allows it.</p>
