	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at recent reports of an upsurge of violence in Darfur by all sides and insists that all parties strictly abide by the demands and commitments made in the 8 April 2004 N'Djamena ceasefire agreement, the resolutions of the Council and the Abuja Protocols. The Council strongly condemns the 8 October attack reportedly by the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army on African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) personnel in Darfur, which killed four Nigerian peacekeepers and two civilian contractors and wounded three others near Menawasha, and the 9 October attack reportedly by the Justice and Equality Movement in Tine in North Darfur, which resulted in the ambush and detention of approximately 35 AMIS personnel. The Council extends its deepest condolences to the families of those killed.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council also condemns the 25 September attack in Modaina, Chad, by armed groups coming from the Sudan, which killed 75 people, the majority of them civilians. The Council joins with the African Union in expressing particular outrage at the 19 September attack by Darfur rebels against the town of Sheiara; the attack by Janjaweed militias on the camp for displaced persons at Aro Sharow on 28 September, during which 29 people were killed and many more wounded; and the attack on the village of Tawilla by Sudanese Government forces on 29 September.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the humanitarian impact that these developments cause and at the restrictions imposed on humanitarian operations in Darfur. The Council insists that restrictions end immediately and strongly urges all parties to ensure unhindered humanitarian access in Darfur.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council also expresses its concern that the Secretary-General's report of 19 September stated there had been 'no visible effort by the Government [of Sudan] to disarm the militia or hold them to account in accordance with past agreements and Security Council resolutions. The SLM/A [Sudan Liberation Movement/Army] and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) are also failing to abide by the commitments made under past agreements and are doing far too little to control their men under arms'. The Council recalls the obligation undertaken by the Government of the Sudan to disarm and control militias. It demands the SLM/A, the JEM and the Government of the Sudan to immediately cease violence, comply with the N'Djamena ceasefire agreement, end impediments to the peace process and cooperate fully with the African Union Mission. The Council again emphasizes the need to bring to justice those who perpetrate violence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council recalls the provisions of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1591(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1591 (2005)</a> concerning the Sudan. It urges the African Union to share the results of its investigations into recent attacks with the Council for possible referral to the Sudan Sanctions Committee in order to assist in the implementation of the provisions of the Council's relevant resolutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its unequivocal support for the African Union Mission, and recalls that the Sudanese Government and Darfur rebel movements have to take the necessary steps to facilitate the deployment and effectiveness of AMIS.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council remains firmly committed to the cause of peace in all of the Sudan, including through the Abuja talks and through full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. It encourages the Government of National Unity and the Darfur rebels to engage in the search for a solution to the Darfur conflict. It urges all parties to make rapid progress at the Abuja talks to conclude a peace agreement without further delay."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-48.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/48</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
