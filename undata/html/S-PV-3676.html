<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fulci</span> <span class="nation">Italy</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The most important consideration in the Secretary-General's recent report on the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), was the continued commitment and determination of President Préval and his Government to consolidate democratic institutions and to create the conditions for sustainable development of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">Four months ago, after the democratic election of a new President and the peaceful transfer of power from President Aristide to President Préval, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1048(1996).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1048 (1996)</a> made a positive assessment of the country's prospects for rebuilding an economy and a society that had been severely affected by the military dictatorship.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">Today the Security Council will adopt a new resolution, which again shows the strong commitment and support of the international community to the consolidation of Haitian democracy and institutions. The spirit in which this resolution has been drafted is to contribute to the completion of a process that began with such difficulty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The European Union completely shares this commitment and this goal, in the spirit of friendship that pervades our relations with Haiti. In fact, the European Union has repeatedly emphasized the need for the Haitian situation to evolve in such a way as to assure stability, security and peaceful coexistence for all members of Haitian society, fostering economic growth and allowing the country to reap the benefits of the efforts made by the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">This is why we have supported the continuation of the United Nations operation in the country. The creation of this new support mission reflects, in our opinion, the need for continued assistance by all of us. In particular, we believe that the completion of the process of creating a new Haitian police force, committed to the rule of law and respect for human rights, is one of the key issues facing the country. Every other aspect of Haiti's future is related to the question of internal security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The necessary reforms and full economic recovery can work only if the domestic climate is conducive to new investments. It is essential, therefore, that the elections scheduled for the local assemblies and the Senate elections next November take place in a secure environment.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">We wish to conclude by expressing our satisfaction at the particular spirit of cooperation that has characterized the work on this draft resolution. We wish to express our thanks to all those who demonstrated good will in making a solution possible. It allowed us to reach an important and significant result, one that will greatly benefit Haiti, its people and the path it has chosen towards democracy. We also want especially to thank the United States and Canada for the concrete contribution they are making to the success of this operation.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">The following countries associated with the Union align themselves with this statement: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Canada. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Since this is my first opportunity this month to address you, Mr. President, allow me first to congratulate you on your outstanding conduct of the Council's deliberations. The delegation of Canada has greatly appreciated your effective guidance of the Council's work this month.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">I also wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Permanent Representative of China, Ambassador Qin Huasun, and his delegation on the excellent manner in which they led the work of the Council in May.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Canada is highly pleased by the Council's consideration today of the draft resolution before it on the situation in Haiti. We are happy to note that all Council members remain committed to assisting the Haitian people in its efforts to consolidate democracy and to rebuild the economy of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">By its decision to establish the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), the Council will clearly demonstrate the international community's determination to pursue its commitment to consolidating democracy in Haiti. The United Nations presence in Haiti has been an essential complement to the Haitian people's efforts to build a democratic, safe and fair society. It is therefore very encouraging to see the Council today, on behalf of the United Nations, proving that it is determined to continue these efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Before going into greater detail on the role of UNSMIH, I cannot fail to recognize the contribution of the men and women who participated in the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and helped it to achieve the goals that we established for its work in Haiti. Their presence made it possible to establish a stable environment throughout the country. It allowed the training of thousands of Haitian police officers to go forward. It also provided the Haitian people with the opportunity to begin the social and economic reconstruction of their country. They made an important contribution, and I wish to convey the sincerest thanks of the Canadian Government to Special Representatives Brahimi and Ter Horst, to the police and military force commanders and to the soldiers and police officers of UNMIH for a job well done.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> <span class="language">English</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">The end of UNMIH signals that a further important step forward has been taken by the Government and the people of Haiti. In recognition of this progress, the Council will now establish a new Mission, one which is significantly reduced in size and to which the Council has given a new, leaner mandate. As the Haitian National Police (HNP) develops its policing role and becomes more effective, different and more specific tasks are required of the United Nations Mission supporting it. UNSMIH's mandate reflects this trend.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">It is clear that a United Nations mission is still required. President Préval made clear in his request to the Secretary-General earlier this month that the Government and the people of Haiti were counting on assistance provided by the United Nations over the coming months to strengthen Haiti's National Police force. He said very clearly that the newly established HNP was not yet in a position to assume sole responsibility for the maintenance of order and security in his country. Haiti's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fritz Longchamp, reiterated this view when the Friends met with him yesterday.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">Fear continues to reign in some parts of Haiti, and public order is maintained only with difficulty. Police officers, newly graduated and deployed throughout the country, are not yet able to control fully outbreaks of violence nor, in all cases, to provide the necessary guidance to beleaguered citizens. Some incidents in the past few months indicate a disturbing trend of violence specifically directed against Haitian National Police officers; indeed, some acts of violence have been committed by young, inexperienced officers themselves. Clearly, an international presence is still required to maintain a climate of stability and to provide moral and material support to Haiti's fledgling police force.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa04">UNSMIH will maintain UNMIH's civilian police (CIVPOL) component at a level of 300 personnel, 100 of these officers being from Canada. With police training as one of the main functions of the United Nations Mission, we welcome the fact that the Security Council will maintain this vitally important CIVPOL commitment.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa05">UNSMIH will also include a small United Nations military force to be deployed in Port-au-Prince only. In Canada's view -- a view which was shared by other troop contributors -- it was essential that the United Nations maintain a military presence in Haiti. Without this military presence, the civilian police officers would not have been able to continue to work as they have, unarmed and often located in small numbers in remote and inaccessible rural communities. An effective military back-up is indispensable in providing logistical support for CIVPOL and in serving as a deterrent to violence against its officers.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa06">The report of the Secretary-General, based upon the United Nations assessments of the situation in the field, suggests that a military force of at least 1,200 military personnel is required to perform this function at a level of risk acceptable to all involved. In fact, our own careful calculations lead us to believe that a force of 1,300, rather than 1,200, will be required to carry out the mandate as laid out in the Secretary-General's report. We believe that a smaller force could imperil both military and civilian police personnel and would undercut the successes achieved by UNMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa07">A force of this size was, however, larger than what the Security Council was prepared to authorize for this Mission. As a result, following on our decision in February and on our significant continuing commitment to the people of Haiti, Canada will continue to provide on a voluntary basis many of the additional troops that will be required to ensure that a United Nations force of sufficient size to fulfil the mandate is deployed in Haiti. Canadian soldiers will thus form a majority of the military forces to be deployed in Haiti over the next five months.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa08">In conclusion, I would like to pay tribute to the courage and tenacity of the Haitian people in working to achieve stability, democracy and the rule of law in their country. Canada is proud to be part of the United Nations mission which is assisting them in achieving that goal. We have all invested a great deal in bringing hope and democracy to Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa09">The promise of a better life for the people of Haiti is, however, far from fulfilled. Yet the predators have been kept at bay and the freely chosen Government in Port-au-Prince is well launched in its efforts to improve the circumstances of its people.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa10">This new mandate will give five more months in which to allow the roots of freedom and democracy to take hold. Canada remains committed to the long-term development of Haiti. Haiti's needs remain considerable, and we urge other countries, agencies and institutions to join us in providing generous and timely assistance to the Haitian Government and the Haitian people, to build a viable and fully functioning economy. Without this, stability and security will remain elusive.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Canada for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Larraín</span> <span class="nation">Chile</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I wish first of all to thank the Secretary-General for his report on the situation in Haiti; we are grateful too for all the endeavours of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and of the entire team of the United Nations Mission in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">This is a very special occasion: the culmination of an important phase in the process of restoring democracy to a brother country with a tragic political history. It is also the conclusion of one of the most successful missions in the history of United Nations peace-keeping operations. The Security Council and the entire Organization should draw satisfaction from both these facts.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Moreover, we hail the Council's reaffirmation of its solidarity with the people of Haiti through the establishment of the new United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). We wish on behalf of the Government of Chile to express our sincere gratitude to the delegations of Canada, China, the Russian Federation and the United States, and to all others that have made it possible to continue the task of political stabilization in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">Under the United Nations Charter, the main purpose of the Organization is the maintenance of international peace and security. Over the past 50 years, the United Nations, in carrying out that mandate, has gained broad experience in neutralizing threats to peace arising from conflicts between States. Yet in the current decade, the Security Council has commenced a new approach to its functions by attempting to control threats to peace arising from problems within States, not between them.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">With the fundamental political changes that took place at the end of the 1980s, the internal problems of various countries have been attracting international attention; this has led the Council to adopt measures in that connection. The viewpoint from which these conflicts is seen has changed, and the continuation or worsening of such conflicts has given rise to concern about avoiding the worldwide repercussions they could have.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">The Security Council has thus found it necessary to assess these situations and involve itself in the internal affairs of States at the request of the authorities of the States concerned. Operations have taken place that constitute true exceptions to the principle of non-intervention. The conflicts in Cambodia, El Salvador and Georgia have characteristics that place them in a category distinct from that of conventional international conflicts. Similarly, various interventions in Africa lack the thousands of years of history and diplomatic practice that apply to the control of traditional threats to peace.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">It was only to be expected that the new situation facing the Security Council, despite the Council's wealth of experience and long tradition in the handling of international conflicts, poses new challenges to its members; these must be met through the creation of the tools needed to address these new needs. Hence, in-depth discussion is required in the general context of the future role of the Security Council and the United Nations in the maintenance of comprehensive peace.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The case of Haiti is an example of a situation demanding a subjective assessment of the country's internal problems that require the support of the international community. It is therefore legitimate that there should be varying assessments of the new mandate's characteristics, even though support <i>per se </i>has never been in question. This was an evaluation that also covered various sensitive aspects of the matter, such as a Government's capacity to maintain political stability and civic peace, both areas linked directly to the exercise of sovereignty.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">I wish in conclusion to stress that we favour the Council beginning a general discussion of this matter, with a view to adapting its procedures to the new challenges it faces.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lavrov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">The Russian Federation is pleased to note the success with which the work of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) will conclude on 30 June. The Mission has carried out with honour the tasks entrusted to it by the Security Council in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-940(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 940 (1994)</a>. New democratic institutions have been established in the country, and broadly speaking the Haitian National Police has been trained and is deployed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">We are grateful to the former Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and to his successor, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, as well as to the commanders of the military and civilian components of UNMIH, for their effective work. We pay tribute to all the personnel of the Mission, which included our compatriots, for their tireless efforts in support of the consolidation of democracy in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">It is no secret that Russia had misgivings about the need for a new operation, particularly with respect to the retention of a military component, at a time when, on the whole, the situation in Haiti is stable and secure, and when there is no threat of organized violence to destabilize that situation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">But taking into consideration the appeal of the President of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. René Préval, the recommendation of the Secretary-General, and the position of the Organization of American States and the group of Friends of Haiti, we have joined other members of the Security Council in consenting to the establishment of the new United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) for a period of five months, to provide underpinning for the Haitian National Police in its formative stages.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">This was possible because the sponsors of the draft resolution took into account proposals made by Russia and China, which were along the same lines. Specifically, the final text of the draft resolution includes a substantial reduction of the military component and the financing of a significant portion of it through voluntary contributions and by troop contributors. We note the contribution of Canada and the United States to the resolution of the financial aspect of this problem.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">On our initiative, the draft also emphasizes the economic rehabilitation and reconstruction of Haiti. We are convinced that only a speedy solution to Haiti's economic difficulties, as well as providing it with sustainable development, will make it possible to establish a truly firm foundation for the support of stability and the further consolidation of democracy in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">With regard to outside support for the reforms of the development programmes, the activation and coordination of the efforts of the specialized agencies of the United Nations, as well as the international financial institutions and donor States, will play a decisive role. Of particular importance will be their capacity to show good will and to take further steps, speedily, to reach agreements with the Government of Haiti that will remove barriers to the provision of the promised aid.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">It is important that the draft resolution seeks to continue, and to further step up, the efforts of the Organization of American States to provide assistance in resolving Haiti's problems. Work on the draft resolution showed that a constructive approach, an equal reflection of the positions and interests of us all, made it possible for Council members to find generally acceptable solutions to questions of the development of new forms and methods of peace-keeping in United Nations activities.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Xuexian</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">The Chinese Government has always attached importance to, and supported, the peace process in Haiti and the positive efforts made by the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, the Organization of American States and the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) in restoring peace and stability in Haiti. We are pleased to note that substantive progress has been made in the Haitian peace process, thanks to the help of the United Nations and the international community. The task of creating a National Police force in Haiti has been completed. The security situation in Haiti has also improved markedly. At present, there are no indications that the Government of Haiti is faced with any organized threat, nor does the situation in Haiti pose any threat to international peace and security. Therefore, UNMIH has fulfilled its mandate in Haiti and will successfully conclude its mission. The Chinese delegation would like to take this opportunity to thank UNMIH for its contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">In view of this situation, we have reservations about the continued presence of United Nations military personnel in Haiti. However, having carefully studied the recommendation of the Secretary-General on the establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), and having taken fully into account the urgent requests of the Haitian Government and the desires of the Latin American countries, the Chinese Government has made the utmost effort, and we agree in principle to the establishment of UNSMIH. We have noted with satisfaction that, thanks to the joint efforts of the parties concerned, after friendly consultations, a consensus has finally been reached on the text of the draft resolution. The Chinese side appreciates the cooperative attitude displayed by all parties. Therefore, the Chinese delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">The Haitian people have made unremitting efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability and have made remarkable progress. The primary task now facing Haiti is rehabilitation and reconstruction. We urge the international community, relevant United Nations bodies and international financial institutions to take urgent and effective measures to contribute to the economic development of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">The Haitian people are industrious and brave, and are masters of their own destiny. The maintenance of a secure environment and economic development depend ultimately solely on the Haitian people themselves, and the help of the international community can only play a supplementary role. We hope that the Haitian Government will seize the favourable opportunity of the presence of UNSMIH to further consolidate the hard-won peace and intensify the professionalization of the police, thus creating a favourable environment in which the Haitian people can live and work in peace and contentment. We sincerely hope that the Haitian people will start leading a peaceful, tranquil and happy life at an early date.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">The establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) in the draft resolution we are about to adopt confirms this Council's support for the efforts of the Haitian people to consolidate their hard-won democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The British Government is pleased that UNSMIH will continue the valuable work of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) in providing the necessary climate for continuing peace and stability. We are particularly grateful to those who have contributed troops and civilian personnel to UNMIH, and to those who intend to continue their support for UNSMIH. We welcome the fact that it has been possible to reduce the force level substantially.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">The key task facing the Support Mission will be the continuation of efforts to establish an effective National Police force. While good progress has been made, the job is not yet done. The role of the United Nations civilian police will be crucial, and we encourage the international community to continue to support their efforts. We commend the Haitian Government's commitment to the maintenance of peace and law and order. We must all now work with them to ensure that governmental and judicial institutions are strengthened to give Haiti the necessary foundations for a stable and lasting democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Haiti's road to democracy has been long and arduous. The international community and this Council can be proud of their support for the efforts of the Haitian people. Haiti is rightly described as a success story for the United Nations. But we must not be complacent. We need to ensure that the task is completed. The United Kingdom will continue its effort and support for that task.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martínez Blanco</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Since elections were held in Haiti at the end of last year, the Haitian Government has continued its efforts to consolidate democratic rule and to resolve the various economic, social and institutional problems that impede the country's development. Through the formulation of economic policies and strategies and institutional reforms, the Government is attempting to respond to the demands of a people anxious to improve their living conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">However, these measures are being adopted in an atmosphere in which security is still relative, owing to increasing crime and the widespread feeling among the civilian population that once the presence of the United Nations comes to an end in that country, groups or persons linked to the former de facto regime will be able to undertake destabilizing acts against the democratically elected Government.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa03">There is no doubt that economic recovery and the consolidation of democratic institutions in Haiti require an atmosphere of security and trust. The Government of President Préval has quite justifiably expressed its concern in that respect, as well as its desire for the continuation of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) to ensure stability and security while the necessary police officers are trained.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Honduras believes that the international community must continue to contribute to the consolidation of the progress achieved by the Haitian people following the restoration of democracy. Haiti needs a secure and stable environment that allows the Government to carry out the economic, institutional and judicial reforms it has proposed, that makes it possible for the upcoming local elections to go smoothly and that makes the country more attractive for domestic and foreign investment.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">The creation of these conditions is up to the institution responsible for maintaining order and security in Haiti: the Haitian National Police. However, that institution has serious limitations preventing it from fully carrying out its functions: it lacks competent high-ranking officers, coordination, training and equipment. In such a situation it is not advisable to withdraw the military and police personnel provided by the United Nations to support the Haitian National Police. On the contrary: it is necessary to continue that assistance so that Haiti can have a professional police force that is of appropriate size and is completely in step with the objectives of consolidating democracy and revitalizing the judicial system.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">The Haitian Government has already decided to establish a professional police force that promotes the rule of law and respect for human rights in Haiti. To that end, there is a programme of activities aimed at promoting the force's development in terms of training, infrastructure, logistics, management and operations. Honduras believes that the international community must help the people and the Government of Haiti achieve that objective, and therefore resolutely supports the establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti with the mandate and composition set out in the draft resolution the Council is about to adopt, and in favour of which my delegation will vote.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">My delegation is aware that Haiti is in difficult economic straits, with low growth and high unemployment. The Haitian Government will also face many social problems, solutions for which must be found in order not to imperil the achievements already made. We believe that the efforts of President Préval and his Government to consolidate democracy, ensure strict respect for human rights and bring about Haiti's development must be firmly supported by the international community. In this regard, we acknowledge the efforts of the United Nations system to speed up Haiti's economic growth, protect its environment and strengthen its national institutions. In addition, we urge the international financial institutions to increase their aid to Haiti so that it can solve its socio-economic problems and thus ensure the existence of the state of law and the politics of national reconciliation that began with the return to constitutional order.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Finally, we wish to express our appreciation to the Governments of the United States and Canada for the voluntary contributions they have pledged to this operation for peace.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Park</span> <span class="nation">Republic of Korea</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">Allow me first to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the outstanding leadership and efficiency with which you have directed the work of the Council during the month of June.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">My delegation would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, Mr. ter Horst, and the Friends of Haiti for their enduring efforts to bring about lasting peace and security in Haiti. With the successful conclusion of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH), we would also like to take this opportunity to express our special thanks to the staff of UNMIH and the countries contributing troops to it for their outstanding achievement in helping consolidate Haiti's democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">Since the historic transfer of power which took place last February, the Government and the people of Haiti have made considerable progress in their quest for democracy and stability under the leadership of President Préval. Unfortunately, however, despite the tremendous progress achieved to date, the overall security environment still remains unstable, as the Secretary-General's report indicates. The potential for instability that might be created by the premature departure of the United Nations is particularly worrisome in the light of the signs of growing popular discontent over the difficult economic situation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">Furthermore, the inability of the incipient Haitian National Police to maintain law and order on its own is a serious cause for concern. The fledgling police force is still faced with the same old problems and in need of sustained assistance from the international community before it becomes a fully functioning force.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We believe that in the longer term, the emphasis of the United Nations role in Haiti should be reoriented and the focus should shift from the current peace-keeping operations to enhanced socio-economic development activities. However, at a time when the nascent democracy is still quite frail and the National Police are not fully prepared to independently ensure the kind of stable and secure environment required for the consolidation of democracy and sustainable economic development, we believe that the security concern should remain a priority. It is in this context that we agree with the Secretary-General's view that complete withdrawal of the United Nations presence is inappropriate at this time.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">The case before us represents a challenge from the perspective of United Nations peace-keeping operations as well. UNMIH was a model of success in combining a traditional peace-keeping operation with post-conflict peace-building efforts. We believe that a continued United Nations presence should contribute to a smooth transition from the peace-keeping to the peace-building stage. In this regard, we are pleased that the mandate of the new Mission is geared further towards the promotion of institution-building, national reconciliation and economic rehabilitation in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">We note with satisfaction that the difficult financial situation of the United Nations has been duly addressed in the draft resolution, through a substantial reduction in the troop strength of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) from the level recommended by the Secretary-General. In this connection, we welcome the willingness of the Governments of the United States and Canada to provide generous voluntary support to UNSMIH. My delegation has held the view that the assistance and commitment of the countries in the region are not only desirable but also indispensable for the activities of the United Nations. We are pleased that the cooperation of the Organization of American States with this world body in consolidating peace and democracy in Haiti has been duly taken note of in the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">Finally, the current situation in Haiti, as in many other areas of conflict, demonstrates the crucial link between peace and development. As noted in the preamble of the draft resolution, long-term peace and stability cannot come to pass without progress in economic, social and institutional development. It is in this spirit that we strongly encourage the development activities which are being conducted by various agencies and the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa09">In closing, my delegation would like to stress once again that the people of Haiti bear the ultimate responsibility for their own destiny. We therefore applaud the Government and the people of Haiti for their firm commitment to the rule of law, democracy and development.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa10">We find the draft resolution before us encompasses all the core elements that we have just mentioned. We will therefore join the Council's consensus and vote in favor of the draft resolution, which we believe marks another milestone in Haiti's path to democracy and prosperity.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the Republic of Korea for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Eitel</span> <span class="nation">Germany</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">At the end of your presidency, I take great pleasure in congratulating you, Sir, on the prudent leadership and wisdom with which you have conducted our work during the month of June.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">Germany fully supports the statement made by the representative of Italy on behalf of the European Union. We also welcome the fact that a number of friendly countries have again associated themselves with the statement of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The developments in Haiti since the return of President Aristide in 1994 and the results achieved by United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) so far are encouraging. Free and fair elections were held in 1995. For the first time in Haitian history, a peaceful transition from one democratically elected president to his democratically elected successor took place in February this year. The successful role of UNMIH in laying the foundations for a new start towards a peaceful, democratic and prosperous Haiti is beyond doubt. I am glad to say that UNMIH will probably be recognized as one more of the success stories of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">We all acknowledge, however, that further steps are needed to stabilize the country, to consolidate democracy and to advance development in Haiti. This will be possible only in a peaceful and secure situation, and for the time being, the peace and security of the situation are still quite fragile. This requires a continued solid United Nations presence, especially in the form of policemen to train Haitian police and a back-up force. After all the international community has already invested in this field, we should not stop halfway. The new United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) will certainly help stabilize, in particular, security and <i>ordre public </i>-- indispensable requirements for a normal life in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Germany supports the Haitian and international efforts to overcome the crisis mainly by a broad development programme, oriented to the basic needs of the Haitian population. Besides a programme for structural adjustment, which it sponsors together with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the German side is helping Haiti with projects to provide clean water, a more reliable supply of electricity, sanitation and rural development -- projects aimed at making life more livable for the people of Haiti. Further projects have been discussed during the recent visit of President Préval to Germany.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">One crucial condition for the successful outcome of any United Nations Mission is, as we all know, its enjoyment of the full support of all parties involved. This condition is fulfilled in the case of Haiti. President Préval of Haiti has explicitly requested the continued presence of a United Nations mission to Haiti. Furthermore, it may be recalled that the continued presence of a United Nations mission to Haiti has been recommended not only by the Secretary-General in his latest excellent report, but also by the Organization of American States during its recent session, held in Panama at the beginning of this month, and, last but not least, by the countries known as the Friends of Haiti. As a result, the new UNSMIH already has a solid basis of support from all parties concerned. This gives it a good chance for success.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">I wish to conclude my remarks by expressing my appreciation to all Member States which have contributed to UNMIH, first and foremost those that have contributed troops or police officers. They have made possible the success reached so far. In this context, we acknowledge the special contributions by Canada and by the United States, in the past and for the future.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">Finally, I wish to thank the Secretary-General and his Special Representative, as well as the civilian personnel, troops and civilian police officers who served in UNMIH, for their efforts in support of peace and democracy in Haiti. Our best wishes for luck and success go to the members of the new UNSMIH.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">We shall vote in favour of the draft resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk03-pa01">I thank the representative of Germany for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Queta</span> <span class="nation">Guinea-Bissau</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa01">It seems that for the first time in its history Haiti has democratic institutions. The United Nations has played a very important role in making it possible for Haitians to express peacefully their desire to establish a political regime that is a manifestation of the will of the people. The way that the elections of 7 February 1996 were conducted in the country is emblematic of that will.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa02">My country believes that much progress has been made in Haiti, thanks to the assistance of the international community. However, the hardest tasks are still to come, including the training of a new police force capable of guaranteeing on its own the stable climate and the security necessary for the consolidation of democracy; the revitalization of the judicial system; and the needed coordination of the activities led by the United Nations bodies working for reconciliation and economic reconstruction in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa03">My country believes that a complete withdrawal of United Nations observers could jeopardize everything the Haitian people have achieved so far with the support and assistance of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa04">Therefore, my delegation supports the continued presence of the United Nations in that country through the establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) until 30 November 1996. We will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa05">Allow me to thank through you, Mr. President, the Secretary-General for his devotion to the cause of the Haitian people. We also wish to pay tribute to all the countries, particularly the United States and Canada, and organizations that have been making efforts to assist in the consolidation of democracy in Haiti.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibisono</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">Let me begin by expressing the Indonesian delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and insightful report concerning the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). Our delegation is cognizant of the fact that the Mission has effectively assisted the Government of Haiti in ushering in a new era by maintaining a stable and secure environment, by permitting democratic elections and by contributing to the establishment of democratic institutions in Haiti. These accomplishments add to the list of success stories of the United Nations peace-keeping operations around the world. Hence, we would like to pay tribute to the men and women of UNMIH for their highly commendable dedication and work in contributing to Haiti's recent success.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">Our delegation duly notes the termination of UNMIH's mandate at the end of June 1996, pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1048(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1048 (1996)</a>. We fully recognize that at the present time there is no immediate threat to the new Haitian Government. However, we would like to underline that the continuation of Haiti's progress is contingent on the presence of a United Nations mission. This has been corroborated by the request of President René Préval to authorize a new multinational force to maintain public order and strengthen the Haitian National Police (HNP).</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">It is to the credit of UNMIH and the Government of Haiti that a new police force has been created and that a commitment to the rule of law has been established. The very presence of this force serves as a buffer, protecting the people of Haiti against the risk of militia operations. UNMIH's military component plays a fundamental role in assisting the Haitian authorities in their security tasks and in creating an efficient logistics system. It also protects key political figures who have enabled the establishment of a newly democratic Haiti. Moreover, UNMIH has supported the training of the HNP and the promotion of institutional development.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">However, the task at hand is not yet complete. There is a lag in the professionalization of the Haitian National Police. More time and training are needed to raise the level of efficiency of its officers so that they may become guarantors against the return of a Haiti ruled by the militia to the detriment of the Haitian people as a whole. In this regard, my delegation is of the view that any response to developments in Haiti should include a proposal detailing the quality and size of the Haitian National Police and a time-frame in which it is to be fully operational.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">The underlying currents in Haiti remain a source of concern. According to the report of the Secretary-General, there is a serious risk of civil unrest due to an increased demand for improved living conditions and the poor economic situation that still prevails. The growing fear is very real that the militia and members affiliated with Haiti's past Government may wish to capitalize on the potentially volatile social situation. Indonesia is of the view that, in order to build peace, we must address the sources of social and political tension, such as problems of employment, housing, education, health care, infrastructure and food supply. Efforts must be applied in all these areas if a country is not only to prosper but also to maintain itself as a viable nation. Furthermore, Haiti's economic performance and the forthcoming elections for local assemblies and the Senate will need a stable and peaceful environment to proceed smoothly and fairly.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">Considering the fact that Haiti is now at a critical juncture in its history, the international community, including members of the Security Council, must ensure that this chance is not lost. The Indonesian delegation considers the request of President René Préval to be reasonable, given the vacuum potentially created by UNMIH's departure, opening the door to insecurity that may destroy Haiti's nascent democratic institutions. In this context, my delegation would like to welcome the initiatives of the Organization of American States and, in particular, the contribution of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti, to promote the consolidation of peace and democracy in Haiti. My delegation strongly believes that regional support is crucial to the future of Haiti. Moreover, in the long run, we hope that a regional solution will play a major and significant role in replacing the United Nations presence.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">We strongly feel that the Secretary-General's vision, reflected in his An Agenda for Peace, of transition from a peace-keeping operation to a peace-building operation fits into the Haitian context. Peace-building needs to be carried out to its fulfilment. It is clear that there is indeed a link between peace and development in Haiti. Although the people of Haiti themselves bear the ultimate responsibility for national reconciliation and the reconstruction of their country, the support of the international community is indispensable for long-term peace and stability in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">In view of Haiti's need for economic development, my delegation endorses the involvement of and projects launched by numerous United Nations agencies and international and financial institutions in order to construct a new and sound economic base. Responsible and resourceful economic policies focused on growth, control of inflation, job creation and privatization will establish the macroeconomic framework in which projects can thrive. In turn, economic progress will recreate the atmosphere for investment, the social stability and the Government commitment needed for Haiti's national well-being.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">In the light of the fragile situation which prevails in Haiti, the Indonesian delegation supports the Secretary-General's recommendations for the establishment of a new Mission, called the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), as reflected in the draft resolution. Considering the financial crisis which the United Nations is presently facing, my delegation is of the view that UNSMIH's mandate should include a gradual reduction of both its military and civilian components; our delegation feels that once the situation finally stabilizes, only a small, symbolic United Nations presence will be necessary. This demonstrates that there is a correlation between the reduction in strength of the United Nations Mission and the improvement of the situation in Haiti. We believe that UNSMIH's limited mandate, with its military component, could provide the necessary back-up for the Haitian National Police and will prove adequate to meet the Haitian Government's request.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">We are of the view that the international community's commitment is crucial in ensuring Haiti's stability and the rebuilding of the country. My delegation will therefore vote in favour of the draft resolution before us today.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Legwaila</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">In this twilight of your presidency, Sir, I welcome the opportunity this meeting offers me to congratulate you, as this is the first time that I have spoken in an open meeting of the Security Council since you became its President. I therefore speak to celebrate your presidency and the manner in which you have acquitted yourself this month. I can assure that your name has gone into the records of the Security Council as representing one of the most successful presidencies, by far, during my country's membership of the Council over the past year and a half.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa02">The date of 30 June 1996 marks the end of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). UNMIH is one of the few successful United Nations peace-keeping operations of recent years. The men and women of UNMIH -- led so ably, first, by Ambassador Brahimi and, currently, by Ambassador Ter Horst -- rightly deserve a pat on the back. They have done a marvelous job in helping to establish a secure and stable environment in Haiti in which democracy could thrive. And they brought the hope of a promising future to a people that had long despaired under some of the most repressive military regimes in the western hemisphere. We salute them.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa03">Haiti has had a tortured history. The memories of the anguish that the general population had to endure under the former military rulers, the militia and their sympathizers will linger in the minds of the majority of the people of Haiti for a very long time to come. A sense of insecurity pervades the national political psyche in Haiti -- and for good reason. Suspicions and fears of a possible return to the past -- that is, to a lawless and dictatorial past -- are ever present in the minds of those who have known nothing but oppression and more oppression all their lives. UNMIH has brought the people of Haiti relative peace and tranquillity such as they had never experienced.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa04">It is no wonder, therefore, that any talk of the withdrawal of UNMIH recalls for them the unforgettable memories of the oppression of earlier years, as the Haitians feel left without any protection. The people of Haiti are not yet confident that the fledgling Haitian National Police can afford them adequate protection against elements of the former Government forces, which they fear, rightly or wrongly, still retain the capacity to destabilize the emerging democratic institutions. They have the sympathy and understanding of my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa05">The United Nations Mission in Haiti was not expected to solve every problem it found in the country. It has been in Haiti to help establish a secure and stable environment in which both presidential and legislative elections could be held in a free and fair atmosphere. That has been accomplished. Responsibility for institution-building, national reconciliation, confidence-building and the economic rehabilitation of Haiti rests with the Government and the people of Haiti themselves. But it is clear that this is not a responsibility that can be left to the people of Haiti alone.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa06">The internal security of the country is not yet assured, and reconstruction and national healing cannot take place in conditions of instability. It is for this reason that my delegation supported the recommendation of the Secretary-General to establish the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). The draft resolution before us establishes UNSMIH. UNSMIH will contribute in no small measure to the training of a professional police force in Haiti capable of ensuring the protection and security of the general population and its property. And, more important, it will reassure the people of Haiti that the international community is not about to abandon them, and will thus frustrate the intentions of elements of the former military and militia forces who may be bent on fomenting trouble in the country when the United Nations leaves.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa07">True, the draft resolution we are about to vote on does not give the Government of Haiti what it had expected, but this happens in any negotiation process.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa08">What is important in the circumstances is for the Haiti authorities to fully utilize the resources being made available to them under UNSMIH. This will be especially necessary in the training of a professional police force which can gain the full confidence of the people and proudly assume all the national security responsibilities in the country. And we are confident that UNSMIH will assist the Haitians in realizing that national dream which is the pride of all nations.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wlosowicz</span> <span class="nation">Poland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Poland is going to vote in favour of the draft resolution establishing the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH). We strongly believe that the international community has an obligation to assist the Government and the people of Haiti in their struggle for stability and normalcy in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">With the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) nearing its conclusion, the Polish delegation would like to pay tribute to all those who contributed to its success, with special emphasis on the particularly generous contribution of the Governments of Canada and the United States. We would like to pay tribute to all the men and women of UNMIH. Their work was crucial for laying the foundations for the democratic future of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">Now, as we enter a new phase in that country's life, it is time to assess, together with the authorities of Haiti, what has to be done in order to consolidate democratic changes in Haiti and, as stressed in the draft resolution, to support the commitment of the Government of Haiti to maintain the secure and stable environment established by the Multinational Force in Haiti and extended with the assistance of the United Nations Mission in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">From this standpoint, the further strengthening of the rule of law is indeed of paramount importance. The United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, which the Security Council is about to establish, will be mandated to assist the Government of Haiti in dealing with one of the essential problems that Government is faced with, namely the professionalization of the police and the creation and training of an effective national police force. These are tasks crucial for the consolidation of democracy and the revitalization of Haiti's system of justice. The draft resolution recognizes the link between peace and security. It is aimed at creating an environment conducive to further involvement by the international community and by international financial institutions in the development of Haiti. This is necessary for the economic rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country, whose progress towards the consolidation of democracy deserves our full support.</p>

	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements following the voting.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Albright</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa01">Today, the Council acts once again to assist Haiti in its journey from tyranny to democracy. In so doing, it contributes to regional stability and serves well the principles of human rights, freedom and social progress that are inscribed in the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa02">Since assuming responsibility from the United-States-led Multinational Force early last year, the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) has helped to ensure a climate of security within which free elections could be held, economic activity could increase, political reconciliation could occur and the construction of democratic institutions could begin. These activities have advanced the cause of freedom and human development throughout the hemisphere.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa03">Today, in response to the request of Haitian President René Préval, we have approved the establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH), as a follow-on to UNMIH. Its mandate is to assist the Government of Haiti in professionalizing the police and in maintaining the secure environment required for the welcome changes in Haiti to solidify and grow deeper roots.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa04">History teaches us that the construction of a durable and democratic society is not an event, but a process. In Haiti, that process requires the patience needed to heal old wounds and learn new ways.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa05">The Haiti of three years ago was infected by despotic and illegitimate leaders. The army and police were used not as instruments of national defence or civil order, but as the means of repression. Between October 1991 and September 1994, thousands of Haitians were murdered, tens of thousands were terrorized into hiding and tens of thousands or more took to the seas. Let us not forget -- for the people of Haiti will never forget -- that when the illegitimate leaders fled, they left behind, nailed to the walls of prison offices and police stations, the obscene photos of those they had ordered tortured, abused and killed.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa06">Today, thanks in part to the actions of this Council, Haiti is recovering. The Government chosen by the people is committed to serving the people. The systematic deprivation of human rights has come to an end. The pervasive fear has been replaced by a resurgence of hope. The process of economic revitalization is under way.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa07">But Haiti continues to need a helping hand against those who will use violence or corruption to obtain what they cannot, or will not, earn through honest work. Haiti needs the means by which to protect itself from these lawless elements, but the past perversion of power has required that this capability be built from the ground up. That process of building effective law enforcement, judicial and prosecutorial capabilities takes time.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa08">In the months ahead, the United Nations role in Haiti will continue to diminish. Not that long ago, there were 22,000 foreign troops in Haiti. In February of last year, a United Nations deployment of 6,000 was approved. Today's resolution authorizes a United-Nations-funded force of 600 military, with the understanding that additional troops will be funded on a voluntary basis by the United States and Canada to keep 1,300 troops ready to assist the Haitian Government and the civilian police monitors. This trend is a dramatic rebuttal to those who suggested that any intervention in Haiti would lead, as in the past, to occupation.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa09">Over the next five months, international civilian police monitors will continue their efforts to professionalize the fully deployed, but still inexperienced, Haitian National Police. The United Nations military contingent will help deter those who might be tempted to disrupt the democratization process.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa10">At the same time, it is vital that the Haitian Government and the international financial institutions agree on the terms of economic assistance. Friends of Haiti, both governmental and non-governmental, must continue their efforts to help Haitian society move ahead, and the door to private investment must be open. There is no better answer to the plagues of Haiti's past than freedom, jobs, basic education and the means for average citizens to put food on the table for their families.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa11">The international presence in Haiti is designed to bolster the ability of freely elected leaders to exercise sovereign power. That is a necessary and proper role, but it is also temporary. Ultimately, Haitian authorities will have to assume full responsibility for public order. They understand and desire that. Our shared objective is to accomplish that transition in a manner that allows economic and social progress to accelerate.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa12">In closing, I want to express the gratitude and admiration of my Government to those who have contributed to the United Nations Mission in Haiti, and especially to the Government of Canada, which since February has fulfilled in an outstanding manner the leadership role.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa13">We are heartened as well by the continued strong support for Haitian democracy that has been demonstrated by the Organization of American States and by the members of this Council. This support reflects the fact that Haiti's progress has had, and continues to have, consequences beyond the borders of that country.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa14">The future of a democratic Haiti is not assured, but the international community can be satisfied that those with the commitment to build a free Haiti have that chance. By allowing that opening, this Council has kept faith with the people of Haiti and honoured its own responsibility as a guardian of international security, law and peace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Dejammet</span> <span class="nation">France</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">The United Nations operation in Haiti is without doubt one of the great success stories of the Organization in recent times. It has made it possible to consolidate the democratic transition in that country by helping the Government to establish a public force that respects the law and is capable of maintaining public order and security. France, which has a special relationship with Haiti and provides it with bilateral aid, has contributed to the United Nations Mission by providing a major portion of the civilian police component.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">President Préval, in a letter addressed 31 May 1996 to the Secretary-General, stressed the fact that the Haitian police was not yet able to shoulder its responsibilities and requested a six-month extension of international assistance. That request was supported by the General Assembly of the Organization of American States in a resolution adopted on 6 June. The Secretary-General, in his report of 5 June, recognized that despite the progress made by the Haitian police, assistance should be continued. He proposed the establishment of the new United Nations Support Mission in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">France lent its support to the Secretary-General's proposal. It was our belief that a sudden interruption in assistance to Haiti could in fact compromise the results obtained thus far, as any deterioration in the situation in Haiti could have a negative impact on the democratic process and on regional stability.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">The resolution is based on the basic elements of the Secretary-General's proposal. In order to make consensus possible, certain elements of that proposal relating to the duration of the mandate and the strength of the Mission were not incorporated in their entirety. However, thanks to the efforts that Canada and the United States have agreed to make, the nature and the resources of the future Mission are not affected.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">The French delegation voted in favour of the resolution and welcomes its adoption by consensus. This unanimity attests to the United Nations success in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">France's contribution to the new Mission should be comparable to the one it made to the United Nations Mission in Haiti.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Egypt.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">Egypt voted in favour of the resolution creating the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, the successor to the United Nations Mission in Haiti, for a number of important reasons.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">First, it is important that the international community close ranks in support of the democratic transformations in Haiti and Haiti's social and economic reconstruction in an environment of security and stability. That would promote the development and flourishing of democracy which, will be translated into well-being for the Haitian people.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">Secondly, the Egyptian Government is convinced that the request from the President of the Republic of Haiti for a continued international presence for a further six months, supported by a resolution of the Organization of American States, provides sufficient arguments to merit the Council's response. We therefore express our satisfaction that the resolution adopted represents a response to Haiti's requests.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">International organizations and agencies must continue their undoubtedly effective role in assisting the Haitian Government to create strong economic and social infrastructures capable of shoring up the achievements of democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa06">The delegation of Egypt expresses its deep appreciation to all States that have responded constructively to Haiti's requests. We thank the Friends of Haiti, as well as the Governments of the United States and of Canada, for their contributions towards ensuring success and consensus in the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">Finally, I should like to pay tribute to Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi for his effective, constructive role during his service as Special Representative of the Secretary-General. We wish the current Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, every success in the mission entrusted to him.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">I now resume my function as President of the Security Council. I call on the Permanent Representative of Haiti, who has asked to make a statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lelong</span> <span class="nation">Haiti</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I would like first of all to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your presidency of the Security Council during the month of June, which is coming to an end with deliberations on the question of Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">The Haitian delegation welcomes the adoption by the Security Council of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1063(1996).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1063 (1996)</a>, authorizing the establishment of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) for a period of five months. This new Mission, which will follow the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) when its mandate expires in two days, should enable the Government to maintain the atmosphere of security in the country while it proceeds to strengthen and professionalize the police, with the assistance of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">The Haitian delegation is grateful to the Council for having duly appreciated the situation that a withdrawal of international support at this stage could have created, and for having acceded to President Préval's request for the continuation of an international presence in Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">The Government of Haiti and the population as a whole were apprehensive about the approach of the deadline of 30 June 1996, when UNMIH's mandate was due to expire. The departure from Haiti of the United Nations troops while the National Police, still inexperienced and under-equipped, are not in a position to take over, would pose a serious problem for the Haitian State and could jeopardize all the efforts the Government has already made to establish the rule of law and rebuild the country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">Despite remarkable results achieved in combating crime and maintaining public order, security is still precarious. In this context, the proliferation in the country of criminal groups making a living from robbery, extortion, kidnapping and drug-trafficking creates upheaval among a population still traumatized by the acts of repression of past dictatorial and military regimes.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">Similarly, the recent attacks on members of the National Police, eight of whom have been killed, as well as the street demonstrations organized by members of the former Haitian army, even though they do not pose an immediate threat to the Government, must nonetheless be taken seriously in the context of impediments to strengthening democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">The Government is aware, however, that security and stability cannot be assured solely by the Police, however well equipped they might be, and that the situation calls for dialogue, tolerance, understanding and above all economic development. The desired results cannot be seen in the struggle against insecurity and the strengthening of institutions unless the population's economic and social conditions are improved.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Measures have been taken to address the serious economic and social problems facing the country. A very ambitious programme has been drawn up which should enable the country to emerge from its economic stagnation within three years. The success of this plan, however, will depend on maintaining the atmosphere of security in the country.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa09">The adoption of this resolution therefore encourages the Government in its untiring efforts, as it sees the international community supporting Haiti's economic, social and institutional development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa10">My delegation is very pleased to be able to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General, and in particular to his former Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and to his current Representative, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, as well as to all the personnel of UNMIH, for their dedication to the cause of democracy in Haiti. We also extend our thanks to the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States and to the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on the Council, which have invariably supported Haiti by unanimously supporting the requests made by President Préval.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa11">I cannot overlook the vital role played by the group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti -- Argentina, Canada, Chile, France, the United States of America and Venezuela. In particular, I thank Canada and the United States of America, which have demonstrated a special commitment to assisting Haiti in its move towards peace, stability and development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa12">Our sincere thanks also go the delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation for their understanding and support.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa13">To all those delegations that have participated in one way or another in the deliberations of the Council, I wish on behalf of the Government and people of Haiti to express our deep gratitude.</p>
