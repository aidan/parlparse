	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the fourteenth report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 14 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1284(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1284 (1999)</a> in <a href="../pdf/S-2003-1161.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2003/1161</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council today heard a briefing from Ambassador Yuri Vorontsov, the Secretary-General's High-Level Coordinator, on the fourteenth report of the Secretary-General in accordance with paragraph 14 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1284(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1284 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expressed its full support towards Ambassador Vorontsov and for his tireless efforts on the issues of Kuwaiti and third country nationals and the return of all Kuwaiti property. The Security Council agreed that his mandate should continue in accordance with paragraph 14 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1284(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1284 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council shared the views expressed by the Secretary-General in his report. The Security Council has strongly condemned the killing of Kuwaiti and third country nationals by the previous Iraqi regime in violation of international law, especially the removal from Kuwait of civilian men and women, their execution in cold blood in remote sites in Iraq and a decade long cover-up of the truth. The Security Council expressed its strong hope that those responsible for these horrendous crimes should be brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council expressed its deep condolences to all of the families of the Kuwaiti and third country nationals. The Security Council expressed its continuing concern for the plight of the families of those persons whose whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council stressed the importance of the work of the Coalition Provisional Authority, International Committee of the Red Cross, the Tripartite Commission and its Technical Subcommittee and called on all parties concerned to continue to work towards a satisfactory solution to all of the outstanding humanitarian aspects covered by Ambassador Vorontsov's mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council expressed its deep regret that Kuwaiti property, including its national archives, has not yet been returned to Kuwait and encouraged the Coalition Provisional Authority and other parties concerned to continue their commitment to the search for, and return of, all Kuwaiti properties and archives, in accordance with paragraph 6 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1483(2003).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1483 (2003)</a>. The Security Council agreed to continue to keep Ambassador Vorontsov's mandate under review and looked forward to receiving his next report."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be published as a Security Council document under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2003-28.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2003/28</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
