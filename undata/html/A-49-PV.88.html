	Mr. Badji (Senegal)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa01">Our debate today devoted to the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s is one of particular importance inasmuch as it awakens our collective conscience to the serious economic situation on that continent.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa02">The consideration of this question gives us the opportunity, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of this prestigious Organization, to reflect on one of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which commits all Member States to combined efforts to promote economic growth in the world, particularly in developing countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa03">Further, the Organization's medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 has identified, among the five global priorities, the one relative to the economic recovery of Africa. Yet we have to note, with regret, that the gap in development between the countries of the North and those of the South is widening year after year, while the economic situation of Africa is steadily deteriorating and has now reached disquieting, indeed alarming, proportions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Africa's external debt recorded an increase of 2.4 per cent and is now about $285.4 billion. The proportion of the exports of our continent that this debt represents increased from 287.4 per cent in 1993 to 288.9 per cent nowadays.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa05">Although the volume of African exports has increased by 8 per cent, receipts, in fact, dropped by 0.2 per cent and levelled out at $74.3 billion in 1993, having decreased by 5.4 per cent in 1991 and by 1.7 per cent in 1992. This may appear to be a paradoxical situation, but it is explained by the fact that the unitary value of African exports fell by 7.5 per cent.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa06">Another worrying paradox is that, although the unitary value of African imports dropped by 2.1 per cent, their value increased by 1.3 per cent and is now in the area of $75.9 billion, notably on account of the 3.5 per cent increase in their volume.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa07">Analysis of these statistics shows that this situation is due to the triple phenomenon of a 5.5 per cent deterioration in the terms of trade in Africa, the increasingly dangerous accumulation of debt in that continent and the resulting reduction, in real terms, in the flow of its resources. This finding is quite indicative of the need to consider adequate measures and concrete action to sustain agricultural production, on which African economies largely depend.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa08">Such support comes through -- among other measures -- diversification of these economies and the establishment of a successful and fairly remunerative system of basic commodities. It is therefore fortunate that the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s should devote particular attention to this objective by envisaging the creation of a diversification fund for basic commodities.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa09">In addition, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the African Development Bank are equally of the opinion that the creation of such a fund would tend to boost agricultural production in Africa, with a double, positive impact on economic growth and on food security in the countries of that area. Indeed, the existence of opportunities within the framework of Amsterdam joint fund is often cited as a means of meeting this need, but an objective analysis of the functioning of that fund has shown its operational limits.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa10">For all these reasons the delegation of Senegal thinks that draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44.pdf">A/49/L.44</a> of 30 November 1994, which was presented on behalf of the President-in-office of the Organization of African Unity by the Permanent Representative of Tunisia, is an initiative that deserves our unanimous support.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk04-pa11">This is why, in associating ourselves fully with the statement of the Permanent Representative of Tunisia and with the statement of the Permanent Representative of Algeria on behalf of the Group of 77, we appeal to all delegations present here to support draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44.pdf">A/49/L.44</a>, when the time comes for a decision, by adopting it without a vote.</div>
	</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk01">
<span class="speaker" name="Mr. Gervais" nation="Côte d'Ivoire" language="French">
	Mr. Gervais (Côte d'Ivoire)
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to endorse what my Tunisian and Algerian colleagues have said. They spoke back to back as the representatives of the countries of the Organization of African Unity and of the Group of 77 and China.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">The economic situation of African countries in this period before the turn of the century is indeed highly alarming. For three decades now the United Nations has tried ceaselessly to find solutions to the problems of development in general and those facing Africa in particular. Now, in the context of the New Agenda for the Development of Africa, the establishment of a diversification fund has been proposed. The purpose of the fund is to diversify African economies and thereby make them less vulnerable and to eliminate the hazards of the raw materials markets.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">The exercise on which we have embarked, following the adoption of resolutions in this connection, implied the cooperation of the developed countries of the North. My delegation in particular saw in it a further opportunity to demonstrate the international solidarity that Africa needs for the promotion of a modern economy harnessed to the global economy. Moreover, this exercise was designed to strengthen cooperation with our partners through, on one hand, existing structures and instruments and, on the other hand, the creation of new conditions advantageous to African economies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa04">In addition, the peoples of our respective countries hoped that this programme with the title "United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s", together with its corollary the fund on diversification of Africa's commodities, would indeed come into being and that our partners would join.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa05">My country, Côte d'Ivoire, which has for the last 34 years been engaged in great efforts to diversify its economy and in the follow-up to those efforts, is aware of the positive effects that such a fund could have on African economies. In this spirit, my delegation hoped our partners would be receptive to our concerns. The lengthy consultations held by African delegations, in conjunction with the discreet and effective contacts made by the current President of the General Assembly, bear witness to Africans' interest in this new programme, which is fully endorsed by the African Development Bank.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa06">Côte d'Ivoire is aware that such machinery, the implementation of which all African countries consider indispensable, will require financial decisions on the part of our partners. But is this too much to ask for the building of something that will last, such as what has been proposed, especially when it is clear that the tragedies and tensions spawned by poverty and destitution in our continent call for enormous sacrifices by our partners, sacrifices in the context of humanitarian operations and sacrifices gladly accepted by the large countries of the North?</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa07">My delegation feels that the time has come to ask the international community to resolutely tackle the African continent's real problems of underdevelopment by providing the right solutions. We are convinced that the proposed diversification fund is an invitation to invest in the harmonious development of our continent and, by extension, in peace. To this end I wish to invite delegations here to lend their full backing to the draft resolution on the diversification fund now being discussed. In our view, there is no existing structure that justifies the reluctance we have seen here. As studies have shown, the existing structures complement the proposed fund and, in any event, could not possibly take its place. We therefore invite the General Assembly to adopt the draft resolution to be submitted on this subject.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa01">Once again the Assembly is considering the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), the successor to the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 (UNPARED).</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa02">When the UN-NADAF was adopted by the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session, it was expected to carry on the unfinished work of UNPARED, which was a commitment by the international community to assist African countries in their efforts for economic recovery and development. The UN-NADAF represents faith in Africa and its people to build their own future and faith in the world community to give its support to that endeavour. In this programme the international community has accepted the principle of shared responsibility and full partnership with Africa and the responsibility and commitment to give full and tangible support to African efforts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa03">We note with satisfaction that a number of initiatives have been undertaken by the Secretary-General and the members of the international community to address Africa's economic development problems. However, we cannot but underscore at this point that the advancement of the larger implementation of this programme still remains very unsatisfactory three years after its adoption, mainly because of the lack of political will.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa04">During this period, the economic situation in Africa has deteriorated further. Africa is the only region of the world which has continued to experience stagnation and decline since 1980. The crisis in food and agricultural production has yet to be resolved. The industrial share of gross domestic product has not increased satisfactorily, and the production structure of most African countries has remained highly skewed, with little connection with the global industrial system. Besides, external trade has provided little stimulus to growth in African economies, and Africa's share of total world exports has declined steadily from 4 per cent in the 1980s to 1.4 per cent in the 1990s. The flow of official development assistance has declined in real terms since 1990. In current prices, flows of official development assistance fell from $19.7 billion in 1990 to $12.1 billion in 1992. In addition, the region's external debt, which was a mere $48.3 billion in 1978, rose to the uncomfortable level of $285 billion in 1993.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa05">The UN-NADAF is almost halfway through its life-span. In a rapidly changing international economic environment, there is an urgent need for the international community to translate its commitment into concrete action in order to reverse the current economic trend in Africa. In the context of the UN-NADAF, African Governments have themselves taken several measures with the aim of achieving the objectives of the programme in the shortest possible time. Their political and economic reforms have had far-reaching effects on existing political and economic structures and their peoples' way of life. However, it is clear that these efforts must be effectively complemented in timely fashion by the international community in order to instal the engine of development in African economies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa06">I would like to stress at this point that the Organization of African Unity has been at the forefront of the development effort in Africa. A major move by the OAU was the establishment of the African Economic Community in 1991. This represents an important economic strategy that is complementary to strategies for accelerated and sustainable development of African countries. In addition, the OAU has established a conflict-resolution mechanism to cope with the recurrent conflicts within and between African countries and has helped create an environment of peace and security more conducive to democracy and economic development.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa07">In view of these efforts by African countries and organizations, there is an urgent need for effective cooperation by the international community in the following areas.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa08">First, there is the need for diversification of African commodities, which is a prerequisite for economic recovery and growth. The diversification of commodities represents the initial step by which the foreign-exchange earnings of African countries could be stabilized and increased. The international community should assist African countries with additional funds that would enable them to carry out pre-investment and implementation projects. In this context, it is important that current negotiations on the establishment of a diversification fund be expedited.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa09">Secondly, foreign debt constitutes another major cog in the wheel of development for many African countries. In <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-151.pdf">resolution 46/151</a>, on the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, specific reference is made to the cooperation of the international community. The international community has attempted to deal with this problem essentially through global debt strategies. However, the specific, serious case of African countries has yet to receive an adequate solution. There is therefore an urgent need to evolve a credible strategy for the reduction of debt burden and the enhancement of the financial capacity of African countries.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa10">Thirdly, at a time when the foreign-exchange earnings have fallen for most African countries, especially during the past decade, financial assistance for development has, ironically, also declined or has served as a reversing force in the major economic reforms undertaken by many African countries. The call for increased financial support for African development is well articulated in many United Nations resolutions. What is required is greater political will from the international community. Increases in real-resource inflow, especially in concessional financing and grants, are very critical to the recovery of African economies. In addition, increases in investments are highly desirable, since they will make a considerable difference in the productive sectors of the African economies.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa11">Fourthly, in an increasingly competitive world economy the tendencies towards the marginalization of the African economies should not be allowed to become more pronounced. The adverse position of African countries in the international economy has not been made easy in the recently concluded Uruguay Round. The projected loss in the volume of trade and earnings for African countries is very important. Adequate compensatory measures are thus called for to mitigate the impact of this loss. In this context, it is important that adequate measures are taken to strengthen the relevant unit within the United Nations Secretariat to allow it to provide the necessary support and visibility of the programme's needs.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk02-pa12">These are just a few well-known areas for international cooperation for Africa's development. Further inaction by the international community would mean not only the aggravation of poverty in Africa but also a defeat for envisaged global development <i>ab initio</i>.</div>

These texts all refer to the question of Palestine and have been drafted in the light of recent developments in the peace process, which the Committee has welcomed and supported.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa02">At the outset, allow me to announce that Egypt, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates have become sponsors of draft resolutions L.53, L.54 and L.55 and that Djibouti, Egypt, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and Zambia have joined the sponsors of draft resolution L.56.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa04">In draft resolution L.53, the Assembly welcomes the signing of the Declaration of Principles as well as the subsequent implementation agreements, including the Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area of 4 May 1994. The Assembly reaffirms that the United Nations has a permanent responsibility with regard to the question of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international legitimacy.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa05">The General Assembly also considers that the Committee has the duty and, indeed, can continue to make a valuable and positive contribution to international efforts to promote the effective implementation of the Declaration of Principles and to mobilize international support and assistance to the Palestinian people during the transitional period. The Assembly endorses the recommendations of the Committee contained in its report and requests the Committee to continue to keep under review the situation relating to the question of Palestine and to report and make suggestions to the General Assembly or to the Security Council, as appropriate. It also authorizes the Committee to continue to exert all efforts to promote the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, to make such adjustments in its programme of work as it may consider appropriate and necessary in the light of developments, and to give special emphasis to the need to mobilize support and assistance for the Palestinian people and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session and thereafter. The Assembly also requests the Committee to continue to extend its cooperation to non-governmental organizations and to take the necessary steps to involve additional non-governmental organizations in its work.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa06">In draft resolution L.54, which deals with the work of the Division for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat, the General Assembly considers that the Division continues to make a useful and constructive contribution through the organization of seminars and meetings of non-governmental organizations, as well as through its various informational activities, and requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide the Division for Palestinian Rights with the necessary resources in accordance with existing mandates and as provided for in the current budget.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa07">Regarding the draft resolution in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.55.pdf">A/49/L.55</a>, negotiations have been continuing over the past few days and, as a result of these negotiations, I should like to make the following oral revisions.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa10">Secondly, the phrase "and in particular the achievements of the peace process" should be added at the end of paragraph 3 (b).</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa15">In the draft, the General Assembly stresses the need for the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, primarily the right to self-determination, and for the withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. It also stresses the need for resolving the problem of the Palestine refugees in conformity with General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948; urges Member States to expedite the provision of economic and technical assistance to the Palestinian people during this critical period; emphasizes the importance for the United Nations to play a more active and expanded role in the current peace process and in the implementation of the Declaration of Principles; and requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts with the parties concerned, and in consultation with the Security Council, for the promotion of peace in the region and to submit progress reports on developments in this matter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa16">The draft resolutions I have just introduced were formulated with a firm resolve to contribute to the current peace process and to make real progress towards a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine. A number of delegations have been consulted in the drafting of these texts, which represent the view of the majority of the members of the international community on the question of Palestine.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg004-bk04-pa17">On behalf of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people, and in the conviction that it is now necessary not only to maintain but also to reinforce our solidarity with the Palestinian people, I invite delegations to reaffirm their support for this objective and constructive approach by voting in favour of the proposed draft resolutions.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa01">My Government is unable to support the four draft resolutions -- <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.53.pdf">A/49/L.53</a>, <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.54.pdf">A/49/L.54</a>, <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.55.pdf">A/49/L.55</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.56.pdf">A/49/L.56</a> -- which have been introduced under agenda item 40, "Question of Palestine".</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa02">Draft resolutions <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.53.pdf">A/49/L.53</a>, <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.54.pdf">A/49/L.54</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.55.pdf">A/49/L.55</a> are artifacts of an earlier time, largely unchanged in their focus and purpose from years past. They have been overtaken by events on the ground in the Middle East. These draft resolutions promote institutions and activities whose approach to the question of Middle East peace is unbalanced and outdated. They do not support the process of negotiation now under way directly between the parties concerned. They do not contribute to a spirit of reconciliation in the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa03">This would be sufficient cause for concern were it not that these institutions and activities absorb financial and human resources that could be put to better use in another way. The international community has clearly stated its support for assisting the Palestinians in building the necessary economic infrastructure and social services. We believe that the General Assembly should consider carefully whether the activities supported by these resolutions represent the most effective use of United Nations resources in support of Palestinian needs. We believe that these resources would be better spent in support of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa04">One way to do this would be to assist the Special Coordinator in the occupied territories. Mr. Larsen has only a handful of people to assist him in his vital job of stimulating Palestinian economic development. My Government strongly advocates transferring resources from the unproductive activities and committees authorized in these draft resolutions to the Special Coordinator's vitally productive efforts.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa05">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.56.pdf">A/49/L.56</a>, entitled "Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine", speaks conclusively to issues that are at this moment under direct negotiation between parties in the region. As a co-sponsor of the Madrid peace process, my Government believes that it is inappropriate and unhelpful for the General Assembly to take a position on issues that are now under direct negotiation by the parties, in a process to which they have given their solemn agreement. At this important moment, we want to support that process of negotiation, rather than focusing on issues or statements that divide and polarize.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk03-pa06">The United States supports the achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. To our regret, the lack of balance in the draft resolution before us obviates their usefulness for the achievement of that objective. We will vote against them, and we invite others to do the same.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa01">Since September 1993, Israel and the Arabs have made historic steps forward in the peace process. Major developments included the signing by Israel and the PLO of the Declaration of Principles on 13 September 1993, and the subsequent Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area, signed in Cairo on 4 May 1994 and the Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities, signed on 29 August 1994. On 14 September 1993, Israel and Jordan signed the agreed common agenda which led to the subsequent Washington Declaration, signed on 25 July 1994, and culminated in the signing of the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty on 26 October 1994. In addition, bilateral and multilateral negotiations continue, and we look forward to progress on all tracks of the peace process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa02">We had hoped that at its forty-ninth session the General Assembly would respond to the new realities in the Middle East by changing and eliminating obsolete resolutions drafted at the height of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Regrettably, this has not happened. The draft resolutions before us do not reflect the new realities, nor do they reflect our hopes for a better future. Rather, they recycle old language and ideas which have hindered, rather than helped, efforts to bring about peace in our region.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa03">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.53.pdf">A/49/L.53</a> endorses and authorizes the work of the "Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People". Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.54.pdf">A/49/L.54</a> does the same with regard to the Division for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat. Israel has opposed the existence of these bodies since their inception. They have obstructed dialogue and understanding through a one-sided and distorted portrayal of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Indeed, they stand in contradiction to the very principles upon which the peace process is based. In addition, these bodies expend valuable resources which should be devoted to more constructive activities, such as supporting social and economic development that would benefit Palestinians.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa04">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.55.pdf">A/49/L.55</a> requests the Department of Public Information to, among other things, disseminate information on all activities of the United Nations system relating to the question of Palestine. We believe that this too is a needless expenditure of valuable resources which could be put to better use.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa05">Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.56.pdf">A/49/L.56</a>, while somewhat changed, remains essentially the same as the resolution adopted last year. Like <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-158.pdf">resolution 48/158</a> D, it attempts to predetermine the outcome of the negotiations on issues relating to permanent status, in contradiction to the Declaration of Principles. And, like the previous resolution, draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.56.pdf">A/49/L.56</a> is fraught with internal contradictions. On the one hand, it claims to support the peace process which began in Madrid. On the other hand, it attempts to undermine the fundamental principle of direct negotiations without preconditions, upon which the Madrid process is based. We believe that Member States that claim to support the peace process have a responsibility to oppose this draft resolution, as it strikes at the essential principles on which the process is based.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg007-bk01-pa06">Accordingly, Israel will vote against the draft resolutions under this agenda item. We encourage others who support the peace process to do the same.</div>

That is why we voted in favour of the draft resolutions.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa02">We wish, however, to put on record our reservations with regard to the contents of the said resolutions that could be construed as recognition of what is known as Israel or welcome for the ongoing peace process, as we believe that that process does not provide the desired just, comprehensive and final solution to the Palestinian problem or to other problems of the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa03">My delegation wishes to reiterate that the resolution of the question of Palestine could be achieved only through the implementation of the many resolutions adopted by the United Nations which the international community continued to reaffirm over the past four decades. We believe that those United Nations resolutions provide the most appropriate framework for a just, comprehensive solution that would enable the Palestinian people to exercise all its legitimate inalienable rights, including the right to return to its homeland and to exercise self-determination.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The events of the recent past have shown that the efforts of the international community have helped in resolving the problem of South Africa which was similar, in many ways, to the Palestinian problem, and have enabled the people of South Africa to establish a united, non-racial and democratic State. This continues to be a model upon which the Palestinian problem could be solved through the establishment of a democratic State in Palestine wherein Arabs and Jews may live as equals.</div>

	Mr. Al-Kidwa ([Palestine])
</span>
	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa01">Let me express our deep appreciation to all Member States that voted in favour of the draft resolutions that have just been adopted under agenda item 40, "Question of Palestine". I wish to convey special thanks to Member States that sponsored those draft resolutions, and to all members of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa02">With the adoption of those draft resolutions, the Assembly sends the proper message to the parties by reaffirming the commitment of the international community to a just and peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and by affirming the role of the United Nations in this regard. By doing so, the Assembly contributes positively to the creation of a better atmosphere in the region and strengthens the position of all those who believe in international legitimacy and the principles of international law and who are effectively seeking a lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa03">We had hoped that these draft resolutions, and other draft resolutions relevant to the question of Palestine, especially those that reaffirm the rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination, would be adopted by consensus in the light of the new situation in the area, for change should take place in both directions if it is to be genuine and realistic. Unfortunately, achieving consensus was not possible, and this has basically been due to what we view as a wrong Israeli approach, one that expects the Palestinian side to give up its inalienable rights and positions in advance and expects the United Nations to give up its own responsibilities towards the question of Palestine as well -- all in return for the beginning of the peace process.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa04">Let us recall that the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track is still at the beginning, and furthermore deals with a transitional period. The agreement to postpone negotiations on the final settlement issues does not and should not detract from the Palestinian positions of principle on those issues, and it certainly does not and should not result in a decrease in the responsibilities of the United Nations in this regard.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa05">No one should say that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and those of international law and international humanitarian law, as well as Security Council resolutions, are irrelevant at any time or in any place. No one should tell the General Assembly to give up its position, enshrined in those principles. Such calls will mean the real prejudging of the outcome of the negotiations through the acceptance of the imbalance of power and the illegal de facto situations that have already been created by the Israeli side. Further, actions illegal under international law remain illegal, and do not become less illegal with the beginning of negotiations.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa06">We had hoped for a more balanced position in the General Assembly on the part of the co-sponsors of the peace process, away from partisan support for one side or, on the other hand, from unjustified changes in position at the expense of the Palestinian people. We firmly believe that the successful development of the peace process requires, among other things, more balanced and objective positions to be taken by each of the two co-sponsors and by them together.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa07">We do believe that the peace process has achieved important progress. We also believe that we at the United Nations have done our best to support that process and to reflect the new realities the way they are. We are sure that the international community and the United Nations will always shoulder their responsibilities in respect of the question of Palestine until a final settlement is effectively reached. Let us only hope that the parties concerned will adhere to their contractual obligations and implement the agreements reached without further delays and difficulties.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg010-bk06-pa08">Finally, we would like to express our thanks to all Member States with which we have worked to produce what we believe to be a very good and useful package of draft resolutions, which has received overwhelming support in the Assembly. We are satisfied with today's results and we are proud of that support.</div>
