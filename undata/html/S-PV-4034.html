	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the interim report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan, <a href="../pdf/S-1999-872.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1999/872</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Tajikistan of 12 August 1999 (<a href="../pdf/S-1999-872.pdf" class="pdf">S/1999/872</a>), submitted pursuant to paragraph 10 of its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1240(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1240 (1999)</a> of 15 May 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council welcomes significant progress in the implementation of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-510.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/510</a>), achieved to a great extent due to the renewed efforts of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan and the leadership of the Commission on National Reconciliation (CNR). It particularly welcomes the official declaration by the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) of the disbandment of its armed units and the decision by the Supreme Court of Tajikistan lifting the bans and restrictions on activities by the political parties and movements of the UTO as important steps contributing to the democratic development of Tajik society. The Council reiterates its encouragement to the CNR to intensify its efforts aimed at the institution of a broad dialogue among the various political forces in the country in the interests of the restoration and strengthening of civil accord in Tajikistan.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council encourages the parties to undertake further concerted measures to ensure the full and sequential implementation, in a balanced manner, of the General Agreement, especially all the provisions of the Protocol on Military Issues (<a href="../pdf/S-1997-209.pdf" class="pdf">S/1997/209</a>, annex II), including those related to the reintegration of former opposition fighters. It also encourages them to continue their active work in creating conditions for the timely holding of a constitutional referendum and presidential and parliamentary elections, underlines the importance of the involvement of the United Nations, in continued close cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in this process and welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to approach Member States with concrete proposals on voluntary contributions to support such involvement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council notes with appreciation the work of the outgoing Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ján Kubis, and of all the personnel of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT), and encourages the Mission to continue assisting the parties in the implementation of the General Agreement. It underlines the need for UNMOT to operate throughout Tajikistan and to have the necessary personnel and financial support and requests the Secretary-General to continue to consider means of ensuring a full and active role for the Mission in the implementation of the General Agreement up to the strength authorized by its <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1138(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1138 (1997)</a> of 14 November 1997 while continuing to observe stringent security measures. The Council urges the Secretary-General to appoint a successor to Ján Kubis as the Special Representative as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">"The Security Council supports the continued active involvement of the Contact Group of Guarantor States and International Organizations in the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">"The Security Council welcomes the continued contribution made by the Collective Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States in assisting the parties in the implementation of the General Agreement in coordination with all concerned.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa10">"The Security Council expresses its concern at the precarious humanitarian situation in Tajikistan. It welcomes the activities of various international organizations and humanitarian workers related to the implementation of the General Agreement and addressing the humanitarian, rehabilitation and development needs of Tajikistan. The Council calls upon Member States and others concerned to respond promptly and generously to the mid-year review of the 1999 Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for Tajikistan."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1999-25.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1999/25</a>.</p>
