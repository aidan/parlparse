	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them documents <a href="../pdf/S-1994-254.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/254</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-1994-322.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/322</a> containing the notes by the Secretary-General dated 4 and 22 March 1994, respectively, transmitting the letters dated 1 and 21 March, respectively, from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">&quot;The Security Council recalls the statement made by the President of the Council on 8 April 1993 (<a href="../pdf/S-25562.pdf" class="nolink">S/25562</a>) and its relevant resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">&quot;The Council reaffirms the critical importance of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards in the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (the Treaty) and the contribution which progress in non-proliferation makes to the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">&quot;The Council notes with deep appreciation the efforts of the Director General of the IAEA and the Agency to implement the IAEA-Democratic People's Republic of Korea safeguards agreement (<a href="../pdf/INFCIRC-403.pdf" class="nolink">INFCIRC/403</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">&quot;The Council reaffirms the importance of the joint declaration by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and of the parties to the declaration addressing the nuclear issue in their continuing dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">&quot;The Council welcomes the joint statement of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States of 11 June 1993, which included the decision of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to suspend the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Treaty, and the understanding reached between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States in Geneva in July 1993, and the progress achieved on that basis.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">&quot;The Council welcomes also the agreements reached in February 1994 between the IAEA and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">&quot;The Council takes note that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has accepted in principle IAEA inspections at its seven declared sites, following its decision to suspend its withdrawal from the Treaty on 11 June 1993, and of the statement by the General Department of Atomic Energy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-319.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/319</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">&quot;The Council takes note also of the findings of the IAEA Board of Governors concerning the matter of compliance and the IAEA Director General's report to the Security Council of 22 March 1994 (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-322.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/322</a>), and expresses its concern that the IAEA is, therefore, unable to draw conclusions as to whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material or reprocessing or other operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">&quot;The Council calls upon the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to allow the IAEA inspectors to complete the inspection activities agreed between IAEA and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 15 February 1994, as a step in fulfilling its obligations under the IAEA-Democratic People's Republic of Korea safeguards agreement and in honouring non-proliferation obligations of the Treaty.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa14">&quot;The Council invites the Director General of the IAEA to report further to the Security Council on the question of completion of the inspection activities agreed between the IAEA and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 15 February 1994 when the Director-General is scheduled to report on</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa15">the follow-on inspections required to maintain continuity of safeguards and to verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear material required to be safeguarded, as noted in the Director General's report to the Council (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-322.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/322</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa16">&quot;The Council requests the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to renew discussions whose purpose is implementation of the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa17">&quot;The Council appeals to those Member States engaged in dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to continue that dialogue in accordance with the agreement reached on 25 February 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa18">&quot;The Council decides to remain actively seized of the matter and that further Security Council consideration will take place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of the IAEA-Democratic People's Republic of Korea safeguards agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa19">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1994-13.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1994/13</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa20">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
