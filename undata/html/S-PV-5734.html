	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2007-488.pdf" class="nolink">document S/2007/488</a>, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on Chad and the Central African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council reiterates its concern about the prevailing insecurity along the borders between the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic and about the threat which this poses to the civilian population and the conduct of humanitarian operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"Following the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1769(2007).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1769 (2007)</a>, the Security Council welcomes the report of the Secretary-General dated 10 August 2007 (<a href="../pdf/S-2007-488.pdf" class="nolink">S/2007/488</a>), which proposes a revised concept of operations for a multidimensional presence aimed at contributing to the protection of refugees, internally displaced persons and civilian populations at risk in eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic as well as facilitating the provision of humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council takes note of the Secretary-General's observations and proposals relating to military elements of the multidimensional presence. It welcomes the readiness of the European Union, expressed at the meeting of the Council of the European Union on 23 and 24 July 2007, to consider the establishment of an operation in support of the United Nations presence in eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council encourages the Secretary-General and the European Union, as appropriate and in consultation with the Governments of Chad and the Central African Republic, to proceed with preparations for this multidimensional presence. It requests the Secretary-General to study, in consultation with the Governments of Chad and the Central African Republic, the follow-on arrangements for this multidimensional presence after a period of 12 months, in particular on the basis of a joint assessment of requirements to be conducted by the United Nations and the European Union six months after the deployment of the multidimensional presence.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its readiness to authorize the establishment of a multidimensional presence in eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic, taking into account the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report and the position of the Governments of Chad and the Central African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council encourages the Secretary-General and the European Union to continue to collaborate with the African Union and regional stakeholders in support of the ongoing process of improving the security situation in the Sudan, Chad and the Central African Republic.</p>
	<blockquote id="pg002-bk05-pa10">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to keep it closely informed of the preparations for each element of the multidimensional presence, including further details on the structure, modalities and force levels.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">"The Security Council welcomes the signing on 13 August 2007 in N'Djamena of the Political Agreement for the reinforcement of the democratic process in Chad. It encourages the authorities and political stakeholders in Chad and the Central African Republic to pursue their efforts of national dialogue, with respect for the constitutional framework."</p>
