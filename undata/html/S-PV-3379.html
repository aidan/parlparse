	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the letter dated 18 May 1994 from the President of the Republic of South Africa addressed to the President of the Security Council, which was transmitted by a letter dated 23 May 1994 from the Permanent Representative of South Africa to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, and is contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-606.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/606</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mbeki</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">This eminent body is meeting today to close a particular chapter in the history of the relations between our country, South Africa, and the nations of the world, as represented by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">We trust that, at the conclusion of its meeting today, the Security Council will terminate the mandatory sanctions imposed against South Africa under the terms of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 418 (1977)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-558(1984).pdf" class="pdf">558 (1984)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-591(1986).pdf" class="pdf">591 (1986)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">We are most grateful to the Council for the opportunity it has kindly granted to our delegation to participate in its proceedings, and would like to take this opportunity to convey to you, Mr. President, and to the other members of the Council, the greetings of our President, Nelson Mandela, and the rest of the Government of democratic South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">We are indeed moved by the fact that the Council is meeting on Africa Day to consider the specific matter on its agenda of lifting the arms embargo against South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">When this embargo was imposed pursuant to the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, it was because the prevailing system of government in our country and the actions carried out by that Government constituted, demonstrably, a threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">We therefore view the decisions that the Council will take today as an acceptance by the world body that we have become a democratic country, and a country that can be counted on to subscribe and adhere to the pursuit of the important goals of international peace and security. Like millions of other people across the globe, we count on this body to continue to act as the principal protagonist in the global struggle for peace, security and stability.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">We firmly commit our country, as a Member of the United Nations and as a responsible citizen of the world, to live up to its obligations in this regard and, consequently, to contribute what it can to the making of the peaceful world which is the right of the peoples. Our Government and people are determined to ensure that within our borders we banish from our national life all those things that make for war and violent conflict.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">The successful transition to a democratic order constitutes the firm foundation for peace which our people have yearned for, for generations. It constitutes also the basis from which we will move in the search for a negotiated, just and stable regional security system for all the peoples of southern Africa, which would guarantee the sovereignty of all the countries of our region and ensure that never again should any country fall victim to aggression and destabilization.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">Our Government has also begun discussions to see what further contribution we can make to the search for peace in Angola and Mozambique, in support of the efforts of the United Nations and the Governments and peoples of those two countries. We are also committed to participating to the full extent of our abilities in the efforts spearheaded by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to address the related issues of peace, security, stability, cooperation and development on our continent.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">We are accordingly ready to begin discussions with the OAU, the United Nations and all concerned with regard to what can and should be done concerning the tragic situation in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">And as we have said, we are otherwise determined to discharge our responsibilities as a Member of this Organization in the collective effort to secure peace for ourselves and for the peoples of the world. We must, in this context, mention the fact that serious steps have already been taken to address the matter of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the regulation of the sale of conventional weapons. Among other things, this has been marked by accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention, as well as the passage of domestic legislation relating to these matters.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa12">Our Government is determined to ensure that we do indeed honour all the obligations which derive from these international agreements, including such agreements as may regulate the movement of equipment and technology which can be used in the production of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. South Africa is also in the process of converting its military technology to civilian application. We would greatly appreciate the assistance of the international community with regard to this matter. Our Government is also keen that a treaty for an African nuclear-weapons-free zone be concluded as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa13">We would also like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks to the Security Council, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the United Nations as a whole for the outstanding contribution this Organization has made in bringing South Africa to the happy situation in which it is today. This, of course, has included the dispatch of observers to help us deal with the matter of political violence and the observers, who played such an important role in ensuring a successful first democratic and non-racial election.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa14">The victory that has been won in South Africa belongs as much to the people of our country as to this Organization and the peoples of the world. As we proceed to confront the enormous challenge of consolidating this victory, we shall continue to count on your support. Precisely because we are conscious of what the world has done for us, we too are determined to contribute what we can to the making of a better world for all.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa15">We are especially pleased that today we meet under your presidency, Sir - end apartheid's crime against humanity and to give birth to a society that is determined to live up to the ideals contained in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Please count on us to behave as an exemplary Member of this Organization, in which the hopes of millions reside.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">The next speaker is the representative of Botswana. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Legwaila</span> <span class="nation">Botswana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">Let me first congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council in a month which we in southern Africa consider immensely historic. It is a fitting and pleasing coincidence that you, the representative of Nigeria and Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid, should so brilliantly contrive to be in the chair of this Council on the occasion of the lifting of sanctions against South Africa. You and your country have contributed in no small measure to the birth of the new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">The same sentiments go to your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, who presided over the deliberations of the Security Council with skill and wisdom last month.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">It is with great pleasure that we welcome the presence in our midst of the first ever First Executive Deputy President of the new South Africa - as Bishop Tutu describes it, he is brand new out of the box - The Honourable Mr. Thabo Mbeki. Mr. Mbeki is here as a free man at long last. Gone are the days when he would come here as an exile, on his knees, to beg the Security Council to impose sanctions on South Africa as a contribution by the Council to the liberation of his people and country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">On 10 May a new South Africa was born when its new democratically elected President was inaugurated. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that 10 May in South Africa was probably the most peaceful day in the whole history of that country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">There could have been no better omen for the rebirth of a nation that had experienced the kind of violence South Africa had experienced for three and a half centuries. Suddenly it dawned on all South Africans in their cultural and racial diversity that their future and the future of their country lay squarely in President Nelson Mandela's vision of national reconciliation, democratic pluralism and non-racialism. Thankfully, 15 days later the country remains peaceful and reconciled.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">Today the international community, through this Council, welcomes the new South Africa back into the comity of free and civilized nations. The removal of the remaining sanctions, we dearly hope, will not mean the abandonment by the international community of the new South Africa to its own devices. We know that the new South Africa has better devices for survival and prosperity than any other country on the continent of Africa. And yet the fact remains that the country needs massive doses of assistance to deal with the ravages of apartheid, and deal with them effectively and demonstrably, if its nation-building efforts are to bear fruit. In other words, now that apartheid is dead the international community must not think it is relieved of its responsibility to the people of South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">The draft resolution before the Council today marks an historic turning point, a near-miraculous salvation for a country and nation that had for so long threatened to drown itself in its own blood. Botswana supports the Council in this move. Sanctions have played an effective supportive role in the struggle against apartheid, contrary to the views of some in this Council who too often in the past would not contemplate invoking them against apartheid South Africa. Isolation and the whole pariahood of rejection and the &quot;skunkhood&quot; of untouchability to which South Africa had to be consigned as punishment for racial tyranny contributed in no small measure to the breathtaking drama of South Africa's transition to democracy.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">Africa's political liberation is now complete. For us in southern Africa, South Africa's liberation is even more welcome. We can hardly believe that our region is free at last - free to devote its energies to economic and social development, free to grow and prosper. As a neighbour, Botswana is committed to the construction of the friendliest of relations with a liberated South Africa, relations based on mutual respect and good-neighbourliness.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01"> I thank the representative of Botswana for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Zambia. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Musuka</span> <span class="nation">Zambia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. I am sure that, with your immense diplomatic skills, a lot will be achieved. May I also take this opportunity to express my delegation's thanks to your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations, Mr. Colin Keating, for the able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the Security Council during the month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">The Security Council is meeting today to dismantle one of the last weapons the international community used in its fight against apartheid in South Africa, the mandatory arms embargo which was imposed on South Africa by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a> of 4 November 1977, and the subsequent <a href="../pdf/S-RES-421(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 421 (1977)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-558(1984).pdf" class="pdf">558 (1984)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-591(1986).pdf" class="pdf">591 (1986)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">The Council is meeting at a time of changed political environment in South Africa. The question of apartheid in South Africa, which was on the international agenda for more than four decades, is now dead, although its ugly scars may still show on the political, economic and cultural face of South Africa for a few more years.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">My delegation welcomes the election process conducted on 27 April 1994, which ushered in a new democratic era. We welcome the establishment of a united, democratic, non-racial Government of South Africa and congratulate Mr. Nelson Mandela, who was inaugurated as the State President of South Africa on 10 May 1994. My delegation would also wish to extend a warm welcome to the South African delegation led by the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">My delegation is naturally happy that the leadership of my country and the people of Zambia have been actively associated with the entire international community, especially the Security Council, in its noble and just fight against apartheid. With the demise of apartheid, it is my delegation's appeal that the international community now harness all its material and financial resources to assist the new South African Government to meet the expectations of its larger impoverished majority and to buttress good governance and human rights. It is now generally accepted that the sustenance of democracy cannot thrive in abject poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The road to the goal attained was long, demanding and oppressive, but we are glad, all of us, that we are there. The election outcome has shown the maturity of South Africans to run their own affairs. The presence and support of the international community is highly commendable. All this shows a glow of satisfaction for all of us who supported and stood for the end of the apartheid regime.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">His Excellency President Mandela of the Republic of South Africa, who had acquired the status of statesman even before he became a Head of State, remains a symbol of a long and just struggle for freedom. It is true that it does not take a hero to order men into battle; it takes a hero to be one of those men who go into battle. President Mandela's spending 27 years in prison and coming out to reconcile all South Africans took just that kind of hero. South Africa is full of heroes of our time.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">As for the future of South Africa, as we have heard from the First Executive Deputy President, we have a new chapter that affects not only South Africa, but also our region and, indeed, the African continent. The changes will positively affect the challenges of our future.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">We are confident that South Africa's greatest challenge concerning its greatness as a country will always depend not on how strong it is, but on the right use of that strength in the maintenance of international peace and security. The return of Walvis Bay to Namibia in the process marks an act of greatness. The region's potential can now be unlocked for the social and economic development which will benefit the entire region.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">My delegation recommends the termination with immediate effect of the mandatory arms embargo imposed against South Africa by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a> and strengthened by subsequent <a href="../pdf/S-RES-558(1984).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 558 (1984)</a> of 13 December 1984 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-591(1986).pdf" class="pdf">591 (1986)</a> of 28 November 1986.</p>

	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01"> I thank the representative of Zambia for his kind words addressed to me and to my predecessor.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mumbengegwi</span> <span class="nation">Zimbabwe</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa01">Let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and by saying how fitting it is that you, the Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid and an active participant of the front-line States, are presiding over this momentous and historic meeting. Our appreciation is also due to your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, for his leadership of the Council during the month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa02">My delegation would also like to extend a most warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, the First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, and his delegation and thank him for his very important address.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa03">Zimbabwe joins the rest of the international community in extending warmest congratulations to the Government and people of South Africa on the final and irreversible attainment of a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa. The struggle against apartheid was long, painful and exacting in terms of loss of life, destruction of property and untold human misery. Its costs were borne not only by the oppressed people of South Africa but also by those in the region and beyond. For over 300 years of colonial rule and over 40 years of the obnoxious system of apartheid, countryman was pitted against countryman and neighbour against neighbour in the struggle for the achievement of unity, democracy and racial equality in South Africa. The inauguration of President Nelson Mandela on 10 May this year was therefore a historic occasion which all South Africans and, indeed, all Africans and the international community must truly celebrate.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa04">We all salute this remarkable and illustrious son of Africa whose own heroic personal life story symbolizes the arduous struggle of the people of South Africa for liberation. It is a fact of history that President Mandela's dedication to liberty and justice for all has made him a legend in his own lifetime. Twenty-seven years of incarceration would have left lesser men bitter and disillusioned. President Mandela emerged from it all with a much wider vision for his country and filled with much more compassion for all the people of South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa05">Under his leadership, the people of South Africa of all races were able to undertake delicate and painstaking negotiations that led to the relatively peaceful establishment of a new South Africa. It is therefore most appropriate that the Security Council is meeting today to take this most important step to enable South Africa to take its rightful place in the community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa06">The people of South Africa have given President Mandela and the African National Congress an unequivocal and overwhelming mandate to right the wrongs of the past, redress the inherited imbalances and create opportunities for social and economic justice for all. It is our hope that the international community will continue to assist and support the people of South Africa in creating a new order in as energetic a manner as they assisted and supported the struggle for the eradication of apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa07">We commend the people of South Africa for the peaceful manner in which they negotiated the transition from white minority rule to non-racial democracy. It is indeed our wish that this be held high as a shining example to be emulated by other nations in conflict everywhere in our troubled world.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa08">Of course, the liberation of South Africa opens up prospects of wide and far-reaching opportunities for our subregion. We can now look forward to an era of peace, an era of political and economic cooperation for the benefit of the region and beyond. The welcome disappearance of a hostile and aggressive neighbour ensures that never again will we have to divert scarce and much-needed resources from development to armaments. The liberation of South Africa is therefore the liberation of the entire region and, indeed, of the entire continent. This is a cause for celebration.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk03-pa09">The termination of the arms embargo against South Africa is both timely and appropriate. It enjoys our full support and we look forward to the day, in the not too distant future, when South Africa occupies its seat in our august Orqanization.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">On this day, when we are celebrating the anniversary of the Organization of African Unity, which recalls so many memories of struggle for the dignity of the individual, including that of the peoples of our continent, the African Group sincerely appreciates the fact that this historic meeting of the Security Council should be taking place under your wise and skilful guidance, Mr. President. We should also like to congratulate your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, for the excellent work he accomplished last month.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">The inauguration on 10 May 1994 of Mr. Nelson Mandela as first President of the new South Africa is an historic event of which the international community, and particularly the peoples of Africa, may be proud. It represents the culmination of the struggle waged by the people of South Africa under the strong leadership of their organizations, particularly the African National Congress (ANC), to eradicate apartheid with the active support of the front-line States, the Organization of African Unity, the United Nations and the whole of the international community. The African countries are glad to have participated to the utmost of their ability in this general mobilization of national and international forces in combating the anachronistic system which is today a thing of the past.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">Africa hails the emergence of the new South Africa and pays tribute to the men and women of all races, all persuasions and all ethnic origins who, inspired by the resolve to put an end to an iniquitous system which damaged both the oppressed and the oppressor, have, by their sacrifices, made this event possible.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">With unflagging determination, unswerving courage and boundless love for their country, the political leaders who faced resistance from an ideology of exclusion have finally managed, as a result of their exceptional qualities, to join in the accomplishment of a noble work, the birth of a great democratic and multiracial country.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">The free and peaceful conduct of the multiparty elections and all the initiatives since undertaken to consolidate national unity are striking examples for the other peoples of Africa and of the rest of the world who suffer from fanatical ethnic or nationalist hostilities. In resuming its place in the international community, South Africa thus becomes a deciding factor in the stabilization of the region and a model of wisdom and maturity.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">In order to enable South Africa to make use of all the resources necessary for its development, the African Group lends its full support to the draft resolution aimed at lifting the embargo and all the other restrictions imposed by the relevant resolutions of our Organization. The Group wishes the Republic of South Africa prosperity, peace and success in the endeavour of national reconstruction; we once again reaffirm the readiness of the countries of Africa to reinforce their cooperation in all realms of activity with that fraternal country, which today is a bearer of hope for a continent in need of it.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">The &quot;odious monster&quot; has been slain; a day of justice and tolerance has dawned for South Africa with the birth of a free nation, relegating the long night of oppression of which poets have sung to the depths of memory. As the battle-lines of new struggles begin to become apparent, we are convinced that the presence in the heart of the great African family of a democratic South Africa represents a decisive advantage to our continent in the face of the numerous challenges that we face.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Bangura</span> <span class="nation">Sierra Leone</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">Allow me, Sir, to express my delegation's satisfaction at the skilful manner in which Nigeria has been presiding over the Council's deliberations this month. I also wish to convey our appreciation to the Ambassador and Permanent Representative of New Zealand for his stewardship of the Council's affairs during the month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">My delegation appreciates being given this opportunity by the Council to participate in the consideration of the item on the question of South Africa. It is indeed a doubly auspicious occasion, first, because during your tenure as President of the Council you, a true son of Africa, should preside over the Council to welcome His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, also a worthy son of Africa, together with his delegation to the United Nations; and, secondly, because what may well be the final act in laying to rest this item on the Council's agenda should also benefit from your presence in the Chair, especially given the close association that our sister country, Nigeria, has had with this issue over the years.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">We listened intently to the address of the First Executive Deputy President as he passionately articulated the hopes and aspirations of the new South Africa. We were deeply moved by the commitment to a new order that the Government must now pursue - an order underpinned by democratic principles and social justice.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">A month ago the world watched as the people of South Africa stood up and took a decision on the destiny of their nation. For many of them it was an experience that they never thought would be witnessed in their lifetime. As the electoral exercise wore on, we came to realize that a new chapter was being written - one that offered hope and reconciliation for all South Africans as they emerged from the tunnel of despair that they had journeyed through. Yet it is important that we recall some aspects of the chapter that has recently been closed, in order to appreciate fully the promise that beckons.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Over the years Sierra Leone added its voice to that of the rest of the international community in calling for a peaceful resolution of the South African question. Then our hearts went out to those who had become the casualties of a divided society, as well as to those beyond that country's borders who felt the harsh touch of its contradictions. Our faith in the ability and courage of the people of South Africa to attain the goal of a non-racial, democratic society never wavered or waned.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">Today, as we mark this momentous occasion, we have had cause to reflect on that chapter in the life of South Africa over which the international community agonized for so many years. Indeed, the road that has brought His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki to this Chamber today has been a long, tortuous and difficult one, littered with the victims of a philosophy that has now been consigned to the pages of history.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">Happily, that chapter is now behind us. Now is the time to look forward. My delegation is convinced that the future course of South Africa is full of promise under the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela, and that the people of South Africa will become an example of harmonious nation-building.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">In its statement on 3 May my Government congratulated the people of South Africa on their victory, and welcomed the new democratic society into the community of nations. I wish to reiterate those sentiments today and express the full cooperation of the Government and people of Sierra Leone as South Africa marches towards its true destiny.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">Allow me to close by observing that we all, as Member States of this Organization, have an obligation to ensure that the momentous developments that have taken place in South Africa, and with which its people must impel themselves to a new and richer experience, succeed. We have felt the travails of a country, taken part in the birth of a nation; we must now nurture its fledgling democracy.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Lamamra</span> <span class="nation">Algeria</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this debate under your presidency, Sir, on the anniversary of the foundation of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), traditionally celebrated as the day of Africa's liberation and when the Security Council is ready to close once and for all the file on South Africa, a question which has been so long before it. A happy coincidence has thus brought together, on a symbolic date, the celebration of a decisive achievement in the historical process of the emancipation of the African peoples and the solemn act of recognition by the United Nations that it has carried out its duty to the people of South Africa. This is occurring, most opportunely, when the Security Council is presided over by a worthy son of Africa, the Foreign Minister of Nigeria, a country whose name is closely linked to the struggle for the elimination of apartheid. In extending my warmest congratulations to Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari, both on assuming the presidency of the Council and on his remarkable work since the beginning of the month, I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Ambassador Colin Keating, for his work as President during April.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">The presence in this Chamber of His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki in his new capacity as First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa reflects the nature and scope of the changes that have just taken place in South Africa, on which the Security Council is now called upon to act, drawing the necessary legal consequences with respect to the sanctions it imposed on South Africa. For the international community this means celebrating one of the most striking events in modern history - the conclusion of a national liberation struggle and a pluralistic electoral process, both of which were exemplary. For the international community it also means participating with the South African people in turning a new page in the history of a great country, whose new President, His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela, indicated in his policy speech to Parliament two days ago in Cape Town that the challenge is now to &quot;build a society focused on man, a society guaranteeing freedom to the individual and restoring the dignity of each South African&quot;. Finally, we must welcome South Africa into the international community, giving it the place and rank to which it is entitled in both regional and international organizations and groups.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">In this context, Algeria is particularly pleased that South Africa has joined the Organization of African Unity, of which it became the fifty-third member State on 23 May, in accordance with the provisions and procedures of the Charter of that pan-African body. Algeria also welcomes the prospect of South Africa's restoration to full participation in the General Assembly very soon.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">Beyond the specific aspects of the draft resolution and its practical impact, what the Security Council is doing today marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one in which a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa will consolidate its national, regional and international foundations and will in various areas make a valuable contribution consistent with its historical experience as well as with its own unique identity and with the capacities of its people and leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Algeria, which provided moral and material support to the fraternal South African people in its struggle and which developed an effective brotherhood in arms with the ANC in its various stages of struggle, is pleased to participate in this event. Algeria shares the feeling of having fulfilled our duty which prevails at this meeting of the Security Council. It is with the same feeling that we shall join in the glowing report on the end of a mission which will soon be prepared, to the satisfaction of all, in the ad hoc Committee of Heads of State of the OAU on Southern Africa and in the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa01">Mr. President, allow me at the outset to express to you my warmest congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council this month. I also wish to thank Ambassador Gambari for his unstinting efforts as Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid and for his conduct of the work of the Council this month. My thanks also go to your predecessor Ambassador Keating, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, for the outstanding manner in which he conducted the work of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa02">The delegation of Egypt welcomes Mr. Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, who represents his country in the international community after years of struggle for human rights and for upholding justice. We listened attentively to his important statement clarifying the new direction of the new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa03">The delegation of Egypt, which feels it an honour to speak on behalf of the Organization of African Unity, wishes on this occasion warmly to welcome the draft resolution to be adopted by the Security Council today, putting an end to the long struggle of the people of South Africa, with the support of the international community, for liberation and for upholding the value of the human person on the territory of this fraternal African country.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa04">We are pleased that on the two occasions Egypt presided over the OAU two main events took place: first, Namibia's accession to independence, putting an end to the era of colonialism in Africa, and, second, the establishment of a democratic, non-racial Government in South Africa under the leadership of President Mandela, to whom we pay tribute for his historic role in ending apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa05">We are pleased on this occasion to welcome South Africa's accession to membership of the OAU just a few days ago, thus taking its rightful place among the nations of the continent and completing the entire African family.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa06">Circumstances have combined to make of this meeting a profoundly significant occasion. It is indeed auspicious that the Security Council should be adopting a draft resolution on ending the arms embargo and other restrictions imposed against South Africa in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a> of 4 November 1977 on the same day that the continent celebrates Africa Day. Three decades ago - on 25 May 1963, to be more precise - Africa's leaders in a historical meeting decided to consolidate their efforts in order to see to it that justice and equality prevailed and that the legal aspirations of the peoples to freedom and independence were met. This historical vision of Africa's leaders has been completed today with the success of the wisdom and political will which led to the inauguration of a national, democratic and non-racial Government for the first time, this on 10 May 1994, in South Africa. This development is considered a victory first and foremost for the majority that has been patient and made sacrifices in its struggle of three decades. It is also a culmination of the efforts of the OAU, especially by the neighbouring countries and the front-line States, which generously provided the political and moral support that gave succor to the liberation movement of their neighbour.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa07">This is also a victory for the members of the international community that tenaciously upheld justice and unstintingly condemned the apartheid regime and refused to deal with it.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa08">South Africa has at the political level attained a great triumph that is hailed by all. President Mandela was able to establish deeply rooted bases for achieving national reconciliation and unity - a matter which was reflected in his selection of the elements of his national Government in which he mobilized all the forces that, despite differences, had contributed to achieving a peaceful transition to a well-founded democratic regime. While the dream has come true at the political level, the struggle of South Africa has not yet ended, for it still faces a great challenge. Solutions must be found for its economic and social problems in order to build a better future commensurate with its location and natural resources that should be tapped with a view to raising the standard of living of the majority that has been deprived and suffered as a result of the racist decisions that impeded the development of the masses in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa09">In our estimation, the reconstruction stage is no less important than that of struggle against the racist regime. It is thus imperative for all elements of South African society to work in harmony and without violence in a concerted national effort to achieve development and progress.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa10">My delegation regards the future of South Africa optimistically and supports all steps towards South Africa's recovery of its natural place within the international family. We look forward to constructive cooperation with it in all fields.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk04-pa11">South Africa is doing what it can to achieve stability, establish the necessary climate for the development process, with all its attendant challenges, mobilize the nation's human and material resources in order to hasten the rebuilding of the State and to make a positive contribution within the African family and in the world at large. We call on the international community to help South Africa in this endeavour.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Razali</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, it is a special pleasure to see you chairing this meeting. The role played by Nigeria and by Ambassador Gambari in the struggle against apartheid is intertwined with the role of the United Nations. It is also symbolic and propitious that an important country, Nigeria, should preside over this meeting which, in essence, brings into our midst an equally important country, South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">Hardly a month ago, the international community witnessed the first democratic, non-racial elections in South Africa. The successful conclusion of the elections is without doubt one of the most positive and welcome developments in the post-cold-war era. Today brings another important event in the history of South Africa, as the Security Council sets about to adopt a draft resolution that calls on the international community to lift the arms embargo and other restrictions imposed on that country. My delegation welcomes this timely decision of the Council, which reflects and is consistent with the current changes that are taking place in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">Given our deep aversion to and abhorrence of apartheid, Malaysia has actively worked within and outside the United Nations in contributing towards the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. During our term in the Security Council from 1989 to 1990, Malaysia had the opportunity to chair the Sanctions Committee on South Africa. Those were tumultuous times, as efforts were galvanized to breach the walls of apartheid. Perseverance and singleness of purpose, together with the unrelenting support of the international community, contributed, among other things, to the dismantling of apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The transition from the struggle for independence to that for national consolidation during the early period of nationhood can be fraught with uncertainty and even danger. No country is wholly independent at the stroke of midnight of its independence day. The unfurling of the national flag marks the long and often arduous path to national development and reconstruction. The international community, for its part, should spare no efforts to support South Africa during this critical period.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">Malaysia is confident that the new Government under the able leadership of Mr. Nelson Mandela will be able to steer the country in the needed direction: that of justice, stability and prosperity for all. In this regard, may I take this opportunity to reiterate our Government's firm support and friendship for the new Government of South Africa. We look forward to working with them in their noble efforts to build their country. We also look forward to South Africa's taking its rightful place and contributing to all the important issues before the United Nations. This is a country long denied, but now proudly ready to make its mark on Africa, the developing world and the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">While we should truly rejoice with the people of South Africa as apartheid is finally laid to rest there, we should not forget that the spectre of apartheid in another form may resurface elsewhere, given, for example, the horrible events being perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Crimes against humanity, in all their manifestations, must be fought and eliminated, as has been done so successfully and gloriously in South Africa.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mwambulukutu</span> <span class="nation">Tanzania</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">Allow me to join the other speakers in expressing my delegation's profound congratulations to the first democratically elected President of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela, and to the entire South African people for having finally achieved their political emancipation from the bondage of apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">We also welcome the presence in the Security Council Chamber of Mr. Thabo Mbeki, the first Executive Deputy President in the Government of President Mandela. His statement to the international community further attests to the fact that the principles of a united, democratic and non-racial society are taking root in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Tanzania further welcomes the admission of South Africa into the membership of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) effective today, 25 May 1994. This rightly coincides with the commemoration of the thirty-first anniversary of the founding of the OAU.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The new democratic South Africa is one of the enviable success stories in recent history. That success did not happen by miracle. It is a result of a protracted struggle, waged primarily by the people of South Africa themselves, which resulted in many of them paying the supreme price either in blood or in interminable incarceration. We also realize fully that these laudable results would not have been possible without the unflinching support of the international community in the form of economic sanctions and other pressures on the apartheid regime.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">We can now, 32 years since the imposition of the first economic sanctions by the United Nations General Assembly, look back with satisfaction because those efforts were not in vain. It is clear that pressures were an indispensable aspect of the world community's strategy for the elimination of apartheid and the establishment of a united, democratic non-racial South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">The people of South Africa and the entire international anti-apartheid movement have every reason to celebrate. Those directly responsible for dealing the most severe blow to apartheid deserve full recognition by the international community. Here we refer in particular to two leading South African personalities - President Nelson Mandela and National Party leader Frederik de Klerk. These two joined forces along with their followers in the pursuit of a peaceful solution.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">The National Peace Accord, which brought together all those committed to democratic principles in South Africa, became possible largely because of the resolve of the two leaders. Inexorable progress, albeit punctuated by violence, followed, as envisaged in the 1989 Declaration on Apartheid and its Destructive Consequences in Southern Africa. It is for this reason that the international community, and the United Nations in particular, proceeded to encourage positive change in South Africa through the relaxation of pressure on Pretoria. That was the purpose of the relaxation of United Nations sanctions, with the exception of the arms embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">This body is convening today to consider the termination of the mandatory arms embargo imposed against South Africa by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a> of 4 November 1977 and subsequent <a href="../pdf/S-RES-558(1984).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 558 (1984)</a> of 13 December 1984 and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-591(1986).pdf" class="pdf">591 (1986)</a> of 28 November 1986.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">The draft resolution now before the members of the Security Council is predicated on the already established united, democratic, non-racial Government of South Africa. The adoption of this draft is important in that the lifting of the mandatory arms embargo will mark a major step towards the return of South Africa to the United Nations. Tanzania believes that the adoption of this draft resolution will further strengthen the resolve of the new Government to redress the legacy of apartheid, embarking on national reconciliation and reconstruction as well as exploring in peace new avenues of constructive links with its neighbours.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">We look forward to working closely with South Africa and urge the international community, especially the United Nations and multilateral institutions, to extend all necessary support to South Africa as it returns to its rightful place among the community of nations.</p>

	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on Nigeria's assumption of the presidency of the Security Council. I have no doubt that Ambassador Gambari's wealth of diplomatic experience and diplomatic skills will be of invaluable assistance in conducting the affairs of the Council. My congratulations go also to the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, Ambassador Keating, on the highly efficient and professional manner in which he conducted the work of the Council during the month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">I wish also to welcome the participation in this debate of His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, Executive Deputy President of South Africa, participation which testifies to the vivid interest of the new South African Government in normalizing its presence among other nations of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">The European Union warmly welcomes the first democratic elections and the establishment of a united, democratic, non-racial Government in South Africa, which was inaugurated on 10 May 1994. We congratulate the people of South Africa and its leaders on this historic occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">In this connection, the European Union welcomes the draft resolution before the Security Council today. The adoption of this draft resolution would lead to the abolishment of the mandatory arms embargo and other restrictions imposed on South Africa by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a>, as well as other measures against South Africa contained in resolutions of the Security Council, in particular <a href="../pdf/S-RES-282(1970).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 282 (1970)</a>, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-558(1984).pdf" class="pdf">558 (1984)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-591(1986).pdf" class="pdf">591 (1986)</a>. It is furthermore stipulated that the Committee of the Security Council established by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-421(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 421 (1977)</a> concerning the question of South Africa is dissolved.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">The European Union is ready to support the efforts of the new Government to accomplish the goal of leading the country to a democratic and non-racial society in which respect for human rights, respect for the rights of minorities, the rule of law, social justice and the elimination of all forms of discrimination will prevail. In this context, I am glad to announce that the European Union, for its part, has decided to lift the last remaining autonomous restrictive measure it had taken since 1985 against South Africa, namely the refusal to cooperate in the military field.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa07">Furthermore, the European Union recalls the decision of the General Affairs Council of 19 April 1994, in which it pledged a package of immediate measures for South Africa. These measures will focus on a dialogue centred on important sectors of South Africa, such as trade, economic cooperation and development cooperation, in order to respond to the immediate needs and aspirations of the South Africans. These measures will be coupled with the beginning of a political dialogue in order to enhance and consolidate the democratic institutions upon which the new South African society will build its future.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa08">The European Union expresses its deep confidence in the new period now lying ahead of South Africa. It believes that the new Government, which now represents the majority of the population, will continue to succeed in finding solutions to the harsh problems it faces through dialogue and peaceful means.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Snoussi</span> <span class="nation">Morocco</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I am pleased to be able to congratulate my brother Ambassador Gambari on the effective and judicious manner in which he has presided over the Council since the beginning of the month.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa02">I should also like to convey to Mr. Colin Keating our gratitude for his presidency last month.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa03">It is very comforting for us today to see the Council meeting at last on the occasion of an event in which our hearts and minds can rejoice. For too long we were denied any satisfaction or joy. Unfortunately, the past years have brought us only tragedies, fratricidal wars and terrible situations. The international community has had to face innumerable crises and interminable tragedies. The maintenance of peace, humanitarian assistance and aid throughout the world have become everyday tasks for the United Nations, which is finding it difficult to respond to all the appeals made to it from every direction and to all the problems it must solve. Bosnia, and now Rwanda, have taken the place of other tragedies that monopolized the press and television through their violence, assassinations, &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, rapes and so on.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa04">In these past years, we have together deplored all that has come to pass. We have given the Security Council our unwavering support. We have reiterated here our hope that the Council's determination would check hatred and evil. In all these cases, our joint action, unfortunately, was doomed to failure by treacherous outlaws who trample upon human morality. Ongoing events in Bosnia and Rwanda are totally unacceptable, but we continue nevertheless to hope that reason will prevail over madness and ruthlessness. We will spare no effort to bring comfort to those who suffer, to stop the invaders and to confront those who, in 1994, still nurture the dream of hegemony and grandeur.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa05">Thank God, in this absolutely bleak picture there is a ray of hope. For several decades, the situation in South Africa seemed insoluble and intractable. After several decades, we began to believe that the dream of the South Africans would never be realized. But the other day, a miracle occurred in Johannesburg. South Africa was liberated from the hydra that had always held it in thrall. Apartheid, racial discrimination and segregation disappeared as if by magic, leaving a free country united in the faith of a glorious and prosperous future.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa06">This occurred not by chance but thanks to the clear-sightedness of its leaders, who were able to transcend their anxieties and disagreements to organize together the future of a very great country. No, it was not by chance, because for years the international community had worked tirelessly, persistently and intelligently to bring an end to the formidable power of apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa07">This time at least, our sanctions yielded unambiguous and incontrovertible results. Everything that has occurred allows us to believe that all is not lost. It is not every day that we come across a great patriot, leader and man like Nelson Mandela, who has demonstrated clear-sightedness, intelligence and, above all, generosity. Of course, it is must also be said that it is not every day that one comes across a great statesman like Mr. De Klerk, who knew that the time had come to turn the page of history and to join the flow of history.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa08">At a time when we are preparing to welcome this sister nation and to put aside the remnants of a painful past, let us hope that the international community will be motivated more than it has been in the past to solve more promptly the problems that continue to prick the world's conscience.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa09">It is our great honour to have the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa among us. We greet him and reiterate all our best wishes for success. We also wish to extend to President Mandela our wishes for a long and prosperous life, that he may lead South Africa to the development and happiness to which it aspires.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01"> I thank the representative of Morocco for his kind words addressed to the Permanent Representative of Nigeria and his predecessor.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of India. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ansari</span> <span class="nation">India</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa01">Permit me to congratulate you, Sir, for assuming personally the presidency of the Council on this historic occasion. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. His presence here today in the Security Council befits the occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa02">The inauguration of the Government of National Unity in South Africa on 10 May 1994 was a very special occasion for South Africa, for the whole world and for the people of India. A new Government elected on the basis of the first-ever multi-racial elections in South Africa assumed office on that day.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa03">The restoration of equality amongst all races in South Africa is a matter of immense and direct satisfaction to the people and the Government of India. Many, many years ago, India, as a fledgling independent State, took the bold initiative to crystallize world opinion against the injustice and inhumanity of the apartheid system and advocated forcefully that the United Nations should be an important instrument in effecting peaceful change and in dismantling apartheid. We did that because we felt that it was our cause and not just the cause of a distant neighbour. Our commitment to this cause never flagged or faltered.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa04">The establishment of the non-racial and democratic Government in South Africa represents a victory for universal human values. As the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narasimha Rao said in his statement on the occasion of the inauguration of the Government of National Unity in South Africa on 10 May 1994:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg013-bk03-pa05">&quot;The South African struggle has shown that the strength of the human spirit, the strength of values of moral conviction, and the strength of uncompromising struggle against domination and exploitation are indeed formidable forces for change.&quot; (<i><a href="../pdf/S-1994-577.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/577</a></i>, p. 2)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa06">The United Nations has made its contribution to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. The Organization actively supported the anti-apartheid movement and contributed to the mobilization of international opinion against the system of apartheid. Sanctions imposed by the Organization, such as economic and financial sanctions and an oil embargo through General Assembly resolutions, played a useful role.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa07">The Security Council played a significant role in hastening the pace of change in South Africa. The arms embargo was symbolic of the Council's abhorrence of apartheid as well as other crimes perpetrated against the black majority in South Africa. The Security Council Committee for monitoring the implementation of the arms embargo, over which India had the privilege of presiding, kept a watchful eye on the situation and brought violations to light promptly. Today, the Council can take pride in the fact that it has contributed substantially to the elimination of apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa08">With the establishment of the Government of National Unity, it is appropriate that the sanctions earlier imposed by the United Nations should be removed immediately. Economic and financial sanctions and the oil embargo were removed by the General Assembly last year, at its forty-eighth session. We welcome the Security Council's proposed decision today to now remove the arms embargo. This will be in accordance with the wishes of President Mandela expressed in his letter to the Security Council President in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-606.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/606</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa09">With the Council's decision today, all sanctions against South Africa would be lifted. We welcome the opportunity it provides for a new South Africa to play its deserved and natural role in this Organization and in the conduct of international relations.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of India for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is the representative of Senegal. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg014-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cissé</span> <span class="nation">Senegal</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa01">The Senegalese delegation welcomes your assumption, Sir, of the presidency of the Security Council not only because of your outstanding qualities as a skilled diplomat but also because your presidency coincides with the holding of today's Council meeting. This coincidence is highly significant, especially in the light of the fact that this meeting is devoted to the celebration of the end of several decades of struggle against the apartheid system, a struggle in which your brotherly and friendly country played an active, dynamic role and through the skill with which your country's representative, Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari, has always guided the Special Committee against Apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa02">I also wish to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand, for the remarkable work accomplished last month.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa03">It is a special pleasure for me to welcome the presence at this solemn meeting of Mr. Thabo Mbeki, Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa. His presence among us is an honour and a source of genuine pride and great joy, because he is one of the most energetic and outstanding architects of the recent and successful evolution that has taken place in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa04">For the entire international community, and especially for Africa, the overwhelming victory won by the African National Congress (ANC) in the first democratic elections in South Africa and the accession of Mr. Nelson Mandela to the presidency of the South African Republic truly represent the enshrinement of the ideals of justice, equality and liberty that have always guided the heroic struggle of the South African people against discrimination and racism in its most inhumane form.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa05">In the message addressed to President Mandela on 4 May 1994, his friend and brother Mr. Abdou Diouf, President of the Republic of Senegal, emphasized that the victory of the ANC</p>
	<blockquote id="pg014-bk02-pa06">&quot;breaks the last chains of apartheid, thus reconciling South Africa with itself, with mother Africa and with the entire international community&quot;.</blockquote>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa07">This victory is also a tribute by the people of South Africa to the man who in the eyes of the world has symbolized the rejection of injustice and discrimination, tenacity in maintaining his convictions and, today, tolerance, fraternity, reconciliation and dialogue.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa08">My delegation also wishes to express its deep satisfaction at the decisive role played President Frederik de Klerk in the process of dismantling apartheid and establishing democracy in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa09">In reiterating its congratulations to the people of South Africa and its leaders, the Senegalese delegation wishes to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to all the men and women who, in southern Africa and the world over, have actively supported the triumph of justice and law.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa10">In Senegal, where the struggle against apartheid has always been one of the major concerns of our governmental authorities and our population, this historic event has been welcomed with relief, satisfaction and hope. It has been welcomed with relief, first of all, at seeing the efforts of the international community and the sacrifices of the worthy sons and daughters of Africa finally rewarded; with satisfaction because, thanks to the political maturity of the political leaders of that great country, democracy, freedom and justice have triumphed in large part and the will of the majority has been enshrined; and, finally, with the hope that thanks to the lucidity and magnanimity of the democratic Government that has been established, South Africa will soon be playing its rightful, important role on the international scene.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa11">For these reasons, here on the threshold of this new era that is dawning in South Africa, we reiterate the appeal made to the international community to give its generous support to the new Government of South Africa in its task of rehabilitating and relaunching the country's economy and in the human development of the majority of its population.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk02-pa12">In this respect, South Africa, its Government and its people can continue to count on the constant support of Senegal, its Head of State, its Government and all its people.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk01">

<div class="spoken" id="pg015-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Abdellah</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your country's assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month and to express our great appreciation for the skill with which Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari has guided the work of this body.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">Our congratulations go also to Ambassador Keating of New Zealand, whose work last month, thanks to his perseverance and determination, was quite remarkable.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">Allow me also to welcome the presence at this meeting of Mr. Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">It is a happy coincidence that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the great, brotherly African country that holds the chairmanship of the Special Committee against Apartheid is presiding over a meeting of the Security Council devoted to the lifting of the arms embargo against South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">We take this opportunity to express our joy at finally seeing South Africa, reconciled with the purposes and principles of our Charter, returning to its rightful place in the bosom of the family of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">Believing as it does in the just cause of a people struggling to recover their rights and dignity, and inspired by the principles of human rights, the international community took up that cause, giving its complete support and applying various forms of pressure against the segregationist system in that country. The United Nations made a very valuable and constructive contribution.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">For its part, the Organization of African Unity played a crucial role in the struggle against apartheid by coordinating the actions taken by the African States to that end, and by making the international community more aware of the cause.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">The people of South Africa at last found the path of harmony and reason in order to make the electoral process work and to make the principles of freedom and equality for all prevail, thus giving birth to a new, democratic, united and non-racial nation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa09">This salutary development was made possible by, in particular, the high-mindedness and statesmanship of the South African leader, Nelson Mandela, and of Mr. Frederik de Klerk. They were thus able to avoid obstacles and excesses, inspired as they were by the desire to serve the common interest of all South Africans.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa10">Since becoming President of the Republic, His Excellency President Nelson Mandela has persevered along the same path by establishing a Government that faithfully reflects the new political configuration to emerge from April's democratic elections, a Government able to establish national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa11">This commitment deserves to be encouraged and supported by all components of South African society, in a framework of continued harmony and respect for constitutional legality.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa12">The support of the international community is also necessary to strengthen this process by supporting the democratic changes that have taken place and by helping to establish conditions of stability and social progress in the country. The total lifting of all the restrictions imposed by the Security Council on South Africa therefore follows the logic of events.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa13">It goes without saying that a democratic, united and non-racial South Africa constitutes a factor for stability and prosperity, at both the regional and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa14">This new nation will certainly contribute to the promotion of cooperation in all fields between the African countries and to joint action aimed at reducing hotbeds of tension and opening up new prospects for the continent's economic and social development.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa15">The forthcoming Summit meeting in Tunisia of African Heads of State and Government will give us an opportunity to solemnly welcome South Africa as a fully fledged member of the Organization of African Unity. The people of Tunisia and, at their head, President Ben Ali, who spared no effort to support the heroic combat of the people of South Africa, are delighted at the idea of welcoming President Nelson Mandela and of expressing to him their warmest congratulations and their best wishes for every success in his noble mission to lead his people towards progress and prosperity and to consolidate the values and principles of equality, justice and democracy in Africa and throughout the world.</p>

	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Tunisia for his kind words addressed to my country; to the Permanent Representative of Nigeria; to his predecessor, the Permanent Representative of New Zealand; and to myself.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">The next speaker is Mr. Abdul Minty, to whom the Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Minty</span> <span class="non-nation">Director of the World Campaign against Military and Nuclear Collaboration with South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa01">I should like on behalf of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and the World Campaign against Military and Nuclear Collaboration with South Africa to congratulate Nigeria on its presidency of the Security Council and to thank Nigeria, as well as the Council, for the privilege and honour of addressing this historic meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa02">This is the fourth time that I have appeared before the Council. In the past it was to call for action against apartheid, but today, on Africa Day, it is to celebrate the democratic transformation of South Africa and to rejoice at the relaxation of the international arms embargo.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa03">We wholeheartedly support the draft resolution before the Council. The statement today by the First Deputy Executive President of South Africa has confirmed the transformation of South Africa from a virtual international outlaw to a normal and responsible member of the world community of nations. Immediately after the 1960 Sharpeville massacre we launched through the Anti-Apartheid Movement an international campaign to stop arming apartheid. The Security Council imposed an arms embargo against apartheid during 1963-1964 and substantially strengthened it in 1970.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa04">However, it was only after the historic United Nations-Organization of African Unity Lagos Conference of August 1977 that the Security Council adopted the mandatory arms embargo against apartheid through <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a> of November 1977. That was the first-ever mandatory decision by the United Nations against a Member State. Thereafter, additional resolutions were adopted to strengthen the arms embargo - namely, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-558(1984).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 558 (1984)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-591(1986).pdf" class="pdf">591 (1986)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa05">It was also decided at the Lagos Conference to establish the World Campaign against Military and Nuclear Collaboration with South Africa, with the Heads of State of Nigeria and the front-line States as the founder patrons. We have over the years cooperated closely with the Security Council's &quot;421 arms embargo Committee&quot;, and its records testify to our consistent efforts to ensure the strict and comprehensive implementation of the solemn decisions of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa06">We should also state that the early warnings we gave of the development of an &quot;apartheid bomb&quot; were not scaremongering, but were founded on solid facts which have subsequently been confirmed.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa07">In addition to trying to prevent arms being used for internal suppression in South Africa, we had to later intensify the arms embargo in order to stop apartheid's growing war in the region. The enormous sacrifices made by the front-line States to advance the African liberation struggle involved a large number of casualties and massive destruction, certainly without precedent in modern history. Newly independent countries risked their national sovereignty and very survival in order to support the freedom struggle, and most of them, like the majority population within South Africa's borders, continue to suffer from the destructive consequences of apartheid.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa08">Despite the loopholes and weakness in the implementation of the embargo, and various violations, we believe that the arms embargo against apartheid played a significant role in bringing about change and reducing the level of violence and human suffering in southern Africa. Of course, it was essentially the struggle of the South African people that brought about their liberation. But that struggle also became the common struggle of humanity, and therefore the cost of the transformation was relatively low. Thus, when the dawn of a new democratic South Africa broke in Pretoria on 10 May 1994 it was a victory for all the people of South Africa and the world, and we can today talk about reconciliation and begin the task of nation-building because the whole world has enormous sympathy for the new South Africa in its future plans.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa09">At last the people of South Africa and of southern Africa as a whole have peace from apartheid and can begin the mammoth task of reconstruction and development in a framework of common security.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa10">As we relax the arms embargo we need to thank the African States, the Non-Aligned Movement and some Western States for their long commitment to anti-apartheid action. We thank the Nordic countries, and, on behalf of the World Campaign, we particularly thank Norway and Sweden for their direct support. We thank Britain for ending the Simonstown Agreement in 1975 and the other major Western Powers which were also persuaded over the years, often through mass, nationwide campaigns, to take more effective action against apartheid. We should also like to thank the &quot;421 arms embargo Committee&quot; of the Council and the Special Committee against Apartheid, and their respective chairpersons, as well as the Centre against Apartheid, for their cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa11">I must also pay tribute to the thousands of extraordinary people who assisted us, some by providing information at considerable personal risk and sacrifice, and others who acted through various anti-apartheid organizations in helping to implement the decisions of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa12">South Africa has had a long struggle for freedom, and our leaders and people always kept hope alive, as did the front-line States and supporters abroad. All that has helped to produce the new reality, which is truly miraculous. The United Nations has played a major role in this process since its inception.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa13">But there are new tasks in the new era. South Africa will need the United Nations and the international community, and the international community and the United Nations will need South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk02-pa14">On a personal note, as a South African who has worked in exile since 1959 to promote anti-apartheid campaigns, I should like to say what a wonderful feeling it was to vote for the first time last month in the first-ever South African democratic elections; to be granted my first South African passport in 35 years; to have had to the privilege to be in Pretoria on 10 May to witness the inauguration of His Excellency President Nelson Mandela as the head of a free South Africa; and today to travel from South Africa on our national airline and participate in this meeting with our First Executive Deputy President, His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, and the Deputy Foreign Minister, His Excellency Mr. Aziz Pahad, and other members of the South African delegation. This is almost an unbelievable experience. It is truly a dream that has come true, for hope at last has become a reality. We can all agree today that the mission has been accomplished.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Misic´</span> <span class="nation">Bosnia and Herzegovina</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa01">Allow me at the outset, Sir, to express the honour our delegation feels in being able to address the Security Council, headed by you, at this historic meeting. Also allow me to commend your Ambassador, His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, for his distinguished leadership and skill in directing the work of the Council, and to express my appreciation to the previous President, His Excellency Ambassador Colin Keating, for his courageous and fruitful job during the very trying month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa02">It is a special honour to be able to welcome His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, the First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, who moments ago eloquently presented the dreams and concerns of the South African people.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa03">The Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would like to take this opportunity to offer its most heartfelt congratulations to the newly elected Government and the people of South Africa on their accession to a society based upon freedom, democracy and respect of human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa04">The resolution to be adopted today by the Security Council is yet another milestone in South Africa's return to normality and the family of nations. The lifting of the sanctions imposed by all the relevant resolutions will help stimulate the economic development needed to facilitate the democratic trends in South Africa. The people of South Africa, now free of apartheid, should also be free of poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa05">But now there is a new South Africa, spawned by the wisdom and courage of President Nelson Mandela, and the vision of Vice-President F. W. de Klerk, and many others like them, who forsook the ways of the past to take on the responsibilities of the present and create a future for this brave South Africa. The myths of racial division were rejected for the truths of democratic pluralism. The legitimacy of these truths was demonstrated to all the world in April during the first all-race, multi-party elections, which were free and fair, as witnessed by the international community. Now a just and prosperous future for all South Africans is being moulded by a united, democratic, non-racial Government, inaugurated earlier this month.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa06">By challenges still exist for South Africans and the international community. In ideology and in practice, racism and racial discrimination pose dangerous threats to pluralism and equality everywhere. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbian extremists continue their campaigns of extermination and expulsion; in Italy, France, Germany and Great Britain and in the former communist countries neo-fascists engage in harassment and murder of minority populations; and even here in the United States, one-time presidential candidate David Duke called on white Americans to help white separatists in South Africa create their own ethnically homogeneous State, an idea, I believe, we all find repulsive. We members of the family of nations must help the Government of South Africa fend off those extremists, who still pursue dreams of ethnic and racial division and domination. It is our moral duty, as well as our legal duty.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk02-pa07">Let me conclude by stating that the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina stands ready to cooperate with the newly elected Government of South Africa, as our dreams are one and the same, and looks forward to doing so.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Olhaye</span> <span class="nation">Djibouti</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">Mr. President, my delegation wishes warmly to welcome you to the Security Council. We are honoured, indeed pleased, to have you presiding over this important meeting today. It is quite fitting that an African country so heavily involved in the challenge and demise of apartheid, most notably as Chairman of the Special Committee Against Apartheid, should be presiding over the Council to remove the United Nations mandatory sanctions against South Africa. We also wish to express our gratitude to my colleague Ambassador Gambari for the constructive role he has played since joining the Council, in particular as its President for this momentous month.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">We also wish to recognize and welcome the Honourable Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of South Africa and Chairman of the ANC, and a venerable part of the struggle for justice and the termination of apartheid in South Africa who is among us today as the leader of his delegation. As President Mandela's right-hand man he no doubt speaks with authority for the new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">The fascinating saga of South Africa's political transformation has passed another momentous milestone with the successful completion of the 26-28 April presidential and national elections and the establishment of the first democratically elected non-racial Government on 10 May 1994. Many of us had held strong reservations in the preceding months, for key issues remained to be agreed upon, major and minor players refused participation and violence remained an ever-present and unpredictable factor, while the logistics and manpower requirements of the electoral process appeared daunting. Almost miraculously though, election day came, turn-out exceeded expectations, violence receded, and perhaps most encouraging of all, the results appear to have been generally accepted as substantially free and fair. The sight of South Africa's first freely elected Head of State taking office this month, was one a weary world badly needed to see in Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">No one can predict, of course, what the future may bring, but we can all take solace in what has been the very capable and wise leadership exhibited by President Mandela and former President de Klerk. The negotiating process has been surprisingly complex, laden with numerous political disagreements, power moves and difficult players. A wide chasm of trust had to be bridged, constituents and factions won over, and expectations and agendas scaled back. The manner in which Mr. Mandela was able to convince his supporters to accept power sharing, to keep the political process moving through quiet, behind-the-scenes negotiations with the leadership of Inkatha, the Government and the white right-wing, overcoming clear disagreements shows the kind of practical and realistic leadership that is so often found lacking today. One must also recognize the courageous and intelligent manner in which former President de Klerk politically prepared the white minority, culminating in the resounding referendum victory for continued negotiations with the African majority which served to isolate and deflate the extreme right. From this perspective, it is understandable that both men shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the crowning third Nobel recognition of the long fight waged by so many in the relentless quest for justice and dignity in that one country.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">This is undoubtedly the dawn of a new era for the black majority, who have languished for nearly 300 years in miserable wages, decrepit housing, and poverty. Understandably, President Mandela has made the basic needs of the majority the first item on his agenda, recognizing that the dreams of a people cannot be realized without electricity, clean water, sewers, or paved streets.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa06">The United Nations can be justly proud of the role it has played in bringing this transformation about. By galvanizing and directing unprecedentedly intense, and relentless international pressure on the apartheid regime over the last three decades, and with the possibilities which opened up with the demise of the cold war, the international community has succeeded in forcing that regime to realize that the &quot;winds of change&quot; had reached gale force.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa07">My delegation must also take this opportunity to express its appreciation for the splendid efforts of our Secretary-General on the whole matter of South Africa, and the untiring efforts as well of his Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. We should also pay tribute to the many members of UNOMSA, the other international observers, the non-governmental organizations and those who worked long and hard to realize the historic changes in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa08">In line with political developments in South Africa, notably the emplacement of its first democratically elected, non-racial Government on 10 May, my delegation fully supports the draft resolution before us that seeks to terminate the mandatory arms embargo imposed against South Africa under <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a>. Inasmuch as this brings to a virtual close the United Nations monitoring of South Africa, we also agree with the dissolution of the Committee of the Security Council established under resolution 421 (I977).</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa09">After long isolation because of its apartheid policies, the new South Africa can look forward to a deeper involvement in Africa, the third world, and international affairs. The road will be long and probably difficult, but as with any journey, it must begin with the first step. South Africa has, by any measure, taken a giant leap forward for its future. The best proof that it will be a most interesting country lies perhaps in President Mandela's inaugural speech, in which he says: &quot;We the people of South Africa feel fulfilled that humanity has taken us back into its bosom.&quot; That feeling of fulfilment, says Nobel Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is like 'falling in love'&quot;.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, my delegation is very happy to see you the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria here today presiding over this important Security Council meeting concerning the situation in South Africa. It is a great honour to the Council and to my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">The Omani historic and cultural ties with the African coastal areas date back centuries ago during which the Omani culture was evident in various parts of the African continent and played a positive role in enriching the cultural and social aspects in many parts of Africa, including the South Africa of that time. My delegation has participated in the concerted efforts of all the members of the Council that led to the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-894(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 894 (1994)</a>, which states, among other things, the Council's concurrence in the Secretary-General's proposal concerning the mandate and the size of UNOMSA and urging all the parties to abide by the agreements reached during the negotiations, as well as to observe democratic principles and to participate in the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">The first non-racial presidential election held in South Africa three weeks ago can rightly be described as a turning-point in the history of that country. The peaceful transition of power in South Africa was a triumph not only for His Excellency Mr. Mandela and the then oppressed majority, but also to the international community and the United Nations, which has worked for decades towards a free, democratic and non-racial south Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">My country was represented by a high-level delegation at the inauguration of Mr. Nelson Mandela and today we are extremely delighted and very much honoured to see that the new South Africa is represented here by its First Executive Deputy President, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, to mark this historic occasion.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the people and the new Government of South Africa on this historic achievement and wish them a better, prosperous, fraternal and peaceful future. We would also like to seize this opportunity to commend the wise leadership of Mr. Nelson Mandela which is reflected in the formation of a national coalition Government, in keeping with the contribution and brave decisions made by Mr. de Klerk with a view to pursuing an equitable approach to the exercise of power and authority in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">In response to Mr. Mandela's call on 24 September 1993, the General Assembly unanimously adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-1.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 48/1</a>, which called for the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed on South Africa after they had lost their <i>raison d'être</i>.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">The significance of the draft resolution under discussion lies not only in the fact that it terminates the mandatory arms embargo imposed on South Africa by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 418 (1977)</a> and by other subsequent resolutions. The resolution also opens a new page in South Africa's relations with the rest of the world and will further facilitate the country's resumption of its rightful place among the family of nations, as pointed out in President Mandela's letter dated 18 May 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">In the light of the above, my delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution under discussion.</p>

	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa01">Mr. President, I should like to reiterate my delegation's warm welcome to you, along with our gratitude for the interest your country has always accorded to the question the Council is considering today under your active and dynamic leadership.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa02">As the Security Council is today considering the item of the agenda devoted to the question of South Africa, I should like to express my delegation's sincere congratulations to the Government and people of South Africa on the conclusion of their country's first democratic and multi-party elections.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa03">The delegation of Rwanda would like to pay particular tribute to Mr. Nelson Mandela on his election to the presidency of the South African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa04">We also take this opportunity to welcome most warmly the presence among us of Mr. Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of South Africa. We wish to convey to him our deep gratitude for the solidarity he has expressed with the people of Rwanda during the tragic times they are currently enduring.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa05">My delegation would also like to pay tribute to the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for their constant efforts towards the total elimination of the apartheid system.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa06">In this context, we should like to thank all the countries and international organizations which furnished electoral observers whose presence contributed to the smooth carrying out of the electoral process and served to curtail political violence during the electoral period. Our gratitude also goes to the many organizations and entities that have played an important role in bringing about the change in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa07">We share the conviction that the holding of free and regular elections last month in South Africa was an historic event which made it possible to put an end to apartheid. Therefore, the international sanctions that have been imposed on South Africa must be removed. We also believe it fitting that South Africa should immediately resume its rightful place in the concert of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa08">The lifting of the compulsory embargo on weapons and other measures against South Africa is imperative in view of the new situation which makes it possible to eliminate the stigma the relevant Security Council resolutions had imposed on South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa09">This event is particularly significant since it coincides with the commemoration today of the Africa Day.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa10">Since the measures and restrictions imposed upon South Africa have led to the dismantling of apartheid and the transition to a non-racial democracy in that country, my delegation will join the members of the Council in adopting the draft resolution before us today.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa11">We believe that with the lifting of these restrictions, South Africa will be called upon to play an important role in the future of southern Africa in particular and Africa in general.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa12">The delegation of Rwanda remains convinced that the consolidation of democracy in South Africa requires a commitment by the international community to the sustained economic growth of that country.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa13">We invite the international community to assist the new Government in every way it can in order to revive the economy and improve the socio-economic conditions of the segments of the South African populations which have been most victimized by the unfairness of the apartheid system.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa14">The success which the international community has achieved through its active determination gives hope to all peoples the world over that now confront the disastrous consequences of horrendous conflicts. May this victory celebrated by the international community generate greater impetus and concern in confronting the human tragedy that has befallen Rwanda.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">First of all, the Chinese delegation would like to express its satisfaction and gratitude, Sir, at seeing you preside over today's formal meeting of the Security Council. Coming, as you do, from a great country that is part of a continent full of vigour and vitality, we are confident that under the guidance of your rich diplomatic experience and wisdom this meeting will be recorded as an important and successful one in the annals of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">On behalf of the Chinese delegation, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming Mr. Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, to our meeting. I also wish to thank His Excellency for the important statement he made earlier in the meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">Today the Security Council will adopt a resolution on the lifting of the arms embargo and other restrictions against South Africa. We have also learned that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has already admitted South Africa as a member. These developments attest to the fact that a new, united, democratic and non-racial South Africa is standing proudly among the nations of the international community. This new nation is bound to have major impact on peace and stability in the region and the world as a whole.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">The successful conclusion of the general elections; the assumption of office by the newly elected President, Mr. Nelson Mandela, on 10 May; the termination of apartheid rule in South Africa; and the creation of a new South Africa in which all ethnic groups coexist in equality and harmony constitute a historic milestone in the cause of liberation of the South African people. This victory has not only helped the South Africans to free themselves from the shackles of apartheid but has also made magnificent contributions to the cause of eliminating racism in civilized society. The Chinese Government and people heartily rejoice at this historic victory achieved by the South African people.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">In recent years, with the help of the international community and through the protracted efforts of the South African people, the situation in South Africa has undergone a number of positive changes. Leaders of various South African parties, with their statesmen's poise and courage, have contributed remarkably to the endeavour of the South African people to build a country of unity, democracy and racial equality, thus receiving support from the entire South African people.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, has always sympathized with and supported the South African people in its just struggle to combat apartheid and win racial equality and democratic rights; we have constantly upheld the peace process in South Africa. We stand ready to develop friendly relations of cooperation with the new South Africa in all areas on the basis of the United Nations Charter and of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">The key to the successful political transformation of South Africa lies in the South African people itself. This historic development shows once again that, in the final analysis, the affairs of a country should be handled by its people, and the affairs of a region by the countries and peoples of that region. As long as all parties show sincerity and political will, there is hope for resolving any contradictions and conflicts through dialogue and negotiation. We sincerely hope that, under the leadership of the new South African Government, the South African people will unite as one and make continued, concerted and unswerving efforts to create a South Africa of peace, stability and economic prosperity.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa01">First of all, I should like sincerely to welcome the participation of the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, in this truly historic meeting of the Security Council, which opens a new chapter in restoring the full-fledged participation of his new democratic country in the life of the international community.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa02">I am also particularly happy to work in the Security Council today, on Africa Day, under the presidency of His Excellency the Foreign Minister of Nigeria, that great African country.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa03">The Russian Federation is extremely pleased at the prompt and positive reaction of the Security Council to the appeal made by the President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela, to abrogate the sanctions decreed by the Security Council some time ago against the Republic of South Africa and to cease the activities of the Special Committee of the Security Council, which has fulfilled its task, having played an increasingly important role in the international community's efforts to dismantle the apartheid system.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa04">The Russian delegation will support the adoption by the Security Council of the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-610.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/610</a>, since it fully corresponds to the task of assisting in the speedy reintegration of the new democratic South African Republic into the international community, and will give strong impetus to the active involvement of that country in international cooperation and the restoration of its full participation in international life.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa05">It is significant that this important political event should take place on a Day dedicated to Africa, whose peoples and countries, on the strength of consistent support by the international community in general, and of the United Nations and the Security Council in particular, made a substantial contribution to doing away with the apartheid system, and to the restoration of racial and social justice in South Africa in the fight for the triumph of the principles of democracy and human values.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa06">Today, on Africa Day, addressing himself to the Heads of Government and to the countries of the whole of Africa, the President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, stressed that:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg022-bk02-pa07">&quot;A most important event in the life of Africa is the conclusion of the South African situation and South Africa's transition to a full democratic existence.&quot;</blockquote>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa08">Today we can note with satisfaction that the goals that we strove to attain for decades have been reached. A historic event has occurred with the general elections that turned the country towards democracy. Russia, which has always supported all constructive efforts by the Governments, parties and public organizations of South Africa towards democratic change, shares with all countries a feeling of deep satisfaction at the results of these efforts. We believe that the people of South Africa is facing bright prospects for harmonious economic and social development. Much will depend upon the readiness of all political forces of the country to engage in constructive interaction such as the one that was evinced in the pre-electoral period.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa09">The present task of the international community, in our opinion, is to do everything to facilitate the speediest return of the democratic Republic of South Africa to the world family of peoples, to eliminate still-existing obstacles and help it to involve itself actively in the work of organizations of the United Nations system.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk02-pa10">Russia reaffirms its readiness to continue its active cooperation with other countries in evolving the necessary documents which would be fully consonant with these important tasks and the scope of the positive changes that have occurred in South Africa.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Mr. President, it is a matter of great satisfaction for the delegation of Brazil to see you, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, personally presiding over this historic meeting of the Security Council, especially as it coincides with Africa Day.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">The Security Council meets today in order to deliberate the elimination of restrictions that were imposed on the former regime of South Africa. The delegation of Brazil fully supports the draft resolution before us.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">We are gathered to confirm the support of the international community for the strides in the journey ahead of the South African people in its valiant efforts to rebuild the country on a united, democratic and non-racial basis. South Africa is now a country where everyone is entitled to exercise full citizenship.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">For too many years, the situation in South Africa has been under international scrutiny, but what in the past seemed to be a faraway goal, hardly supposed to be reached, has now come true. The long-suffering people of South Africa has won. Its most legitimate claim for equal rights and the opportunity to be treated equally has finally been heard.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">It gives me great pleasure to welcome to this meeting Mr. Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa. His presence among us here today is a definite assurance that South Africa has at last entered the new phase of its history. We thank him for his statement and thought-provoking remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa06">Apartheid and social and racial violence in South Africa have always posed a threat to peace and security. Brazil has hence favoured the deep involvement of the Security Council in the promotion of a peaceful settlement of internal disputes in South Africa. Time and again, in this forum and in other forums of the United Nations, we have dealt with the problems generated by the evil of apartheid. Today, after the triumph of the cause of freedom and equality in South Africa, we salute a landmark victory of democracy and hope. A new era is indeed dawning for the region and the continent. In this sense, we particularly welcome the decision of the new South African Government to contribute to the international efforts in search of peace in Angola and Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa07">This is a bright and joyful moment. As in any complex political process, the building of a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa has taken a very long time and has been delayed in various instances. Not all past moments in this struggle have been positive and many steps forward were followed by some movement backwards. As a long-time supporter of the efforts leading to the construction of the multi-racial South Africa, Brazil has saluted the birth of democracy in South Africa. This could not have been achieved without the inspiration of President Nelson Mandela, a man of destiny, courage and action. My Government has expressed its commitment to strengthening our ties with the new South Africa and has reiterated its readiness to contribute to the huge tasks lying ahead in that country's reconstruction efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa08">President Mandela's statesmanship is a source of inspiration to us all. His ability to negotiate and overcome hurdles during the entire transition period was indeed remarkable. His lack of bitterness and his forward-looking approach have been fundamental in ensuring the dismantling of apartheid. We also acknowledge the positive role played by Mr. De Klerk in the political process in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa09">The free and fair elections just held in that country show that, despite decades of political oppression, the South African people was able to choose a most worthy leadership. For a long time, many men and women have endured terrible hardship so that this reality could come true. The wise and courageous people of South Africa was the main protagonist in this true odyssey. I wish at this moment to pay tribute to those many unsung South African heroes and victims of apartheid who gave their lives to make this new era a reality.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa10">The United Nations and its membership deserve their share of the praise too. The past initiatives of this main organ of the United Nations against the former Government of South Africa, which we are now scratching from the books, contributed to paving the way to the new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa11">This is one of those very few occasions when all of us feel gratified. Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that if, today, the international community can rejoice, this is also a direct result of its firm, active, decisive and unabated commitment to the cause of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa for an extended period of time. Today's achievement should inspire the Council on forthcoming actions in the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa12">On this occasion, when we are privileged to witness the birth of a democratic country, Brazil, as a South Atlantic neighbour of South Africa's, looks forward to the moment when South Africa will take its place in the partnership of the countries of the Zone of Peace and Cooperation in the South Atlantic. We also look forward to the expeditious reintegration of South Africa into the international community and its full-fledged participation in all international forums, particularly in the United Nations system. Let us hope that the conclusion of South Africa's successful and peaceful transition to democracy will make its positive effects felt in other situations on the agenda of the United Nations.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa02">I should like to begin by welcoming the First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and his delegation to the Security Council on this historic occasion. He is no stranger to us here at the United Nations nor, indeed, to my own Government, which has greatly valued the moderate and constructive role he played in the difficult period through which his country and all of us have passed. But we are delighted that he is here now as a representative of the freely and fairly elected Government of a new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa03">The lifting of the arms embargo imposed by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a> and related measures provided for in other Council resolutions represents the formal and symbolic acknowledgement by this Council that apartheid is dead and that South Africa's isolation has come to an end. The resolution we have just adopted may be technical in its content, the final stage of the process of ending the measures imposed against South Africa by the United Nations, but it represents the culmination of an astonishing political transformation which few predicted in this time-scale. The adoption of this resolution provides us with a first opportunity at the United Nations to celebrate the opening of a new and long-awaited chapter in the history of South Africa, an opportunity which we must now seize and to which we must give substantive content.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa04">The United Nations can be proud of the role that it played in providing observers for the first multi-party democratic elections in South Africa and in helping to control and mitigate the tide of political violence. British observers participated in these United Nations and in other international efforts to support and validate the election process, and we were delighted to do so. Such efforts were a further tangible demonstration of the commitment of the international community to support and assist the development of democracy in South Africa. But in the final analysis, the elections were a triumph for the people of South Africa, whose long struggle and whole-hearted commitment to democracy has won them the admiration of the whole world.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa05">So a great new democracy is born, one with which my country has particularly close ties. It will now take its place in the community of nations. The road ahead will not always be easy. The challenges that will arise must be tackled by South Africans. Economic growth and stability must be given the highest priority, and in that context we warmly welcome President Mandela's statement yesterday of his Government's economic and other programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa06">The international community must demonstrate its support and encouragement for the new Government and its policies, not just by lifting any remaining restrictions, but also by helping to encourage investment, by providing technical assistance and by offering open and liberal trading arrangements. The British Government is doing all these things, and we intend to go on doing so. And, as the representative of Greece has pointed out, so will the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa07">The resolution we have just adopted refers to the urgent need to facilitate the reintegration of South Africa into the international community, including into the United Nations system. We look forward to the new South Africa's resuming its seat in the General Assembly as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa08">My Government believes that the question of the arrears owed by South Africa to the United Nations, which has still to be discussed, should not prevent it from taking its rightful place in this Organization and from exercising its right to vote. Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations provides for the General Assembly to permit a Member State in arrears to vote if it is satisfied that the problem arose from conditions beyond the control of the Member in question. We believe that South Africa should benefit from that provision.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk04-pa09">Few subjects have been more often raised in the Security Council over many years than the question of South Africa. I can think of no better wish to offer the new South Africa than that it should never figure again on the agenda of the Security Council.</p>

	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa01">My Government welcomes the recent events in South Africa that have led to this meeting of the Security Council in circumstances that we can describe without exaggeration as historic. Indeed, it is Africa's day, and it is also the day when the Security Council has lifted the sanctions it imposed on South Africa almost 20 years ago. Today's resolution has been adopted in the presence of the First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, whom we are pleased to welcome here. Finally, the Council enjoys the privilege of being presided over by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria. In truth, it would be difficult to gather together in one place more symbols than those we have here.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa02">Following the first multiracial elections held in South Africa, in April 1994, that country was able, on 10 May, to inaugurate a united, democratic and non-racial Government. My delegation warmly welcomes President Nelson Mandela's election to lead South Africa, for he has devoted his life to the abolition of the odious regime of apartheid and his very existence to the establishment of a multiracial democracy, of which South Africa is now an example for the whole world.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa03">France also wishes to praise the efforts of former President De Klerk to promote this turn of events which only a few years ago seemed highly improbable.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa04">By lifting the sanctions that the Council placed on South Africa long ago, the United Nations is entering a decisive and symbolic stage on the way to that country's full reintegration into the international community. We hope that South Africa will very quickly recover its place in the family of nations and, more particularly, in Africa. It has already become the fifty-third member of the Organization of African Unity.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa05">Finally, our Council is also showing today that it is able to respond to the political evolution of certain situations by putting an end to sanctions when circumstances permit.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk02-pa06">France, for its part, will continue to give the people of South Africa its full cooperation in assuring their country of stability and development so that democracy and progress can take a firm and lasting hold in southern Africa.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gnehm</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa01">May I begin by warmly welcoming the attendance of the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki. It is indeed an honour for us all that he and his delegation could be with us today, a day that is indeed historic.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa02">Today's vote in the Security Council is timely recognition of the dramatic changes that have taken place in South Africa, changes that this Organization helped bring about. The United Nations arms embargoes and related restrictions imposed by this body against South Africa contributed significantly to the demise of apartheid. Now that apartheid has been dismantled and non-racial democracy is taking root, these restrictions are simply no longer appropriate. My Government strongly and unequivocally supports this resolution, which calls for their immediate removal.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa03">South Africa's first non-racial election, last month, and the inauguration of President Mandela on 10 May capped that nation's successful struggle against apartheid and opened the way for South Africa to join the family of democracies. This resolution is an important step to bring South Africa into the fold of the community of democratic nations. We hope to see South Africa play a leading role - through the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations - in promoting peace and stability in its region and its continent.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk02-pa04">This is an historic moment in the United Nations relationship with South Africa. The international community and the people of South Africa are united in the goal of ensuring that South Africa becomes an active and positive member of the community of democratic States. The United States joins the United Nations in celebrating this great achievement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Keating</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa01">May I first extend to you personally, Mr. President, a very warm welcome. Nigeria has played a very important role in the United Nations and in the Commonwealth on the question of South Africa. Ambassador Gambari, in his role as Chairman of the Special Committee, has made a significant personal contribution. It is therefore very fitting that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria is presiding over the Council on this very auspicious day.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa02">It gives me and my country very great pleasure to be able to participate in the adoption of the resolution which was adopted today in response to the letter of Mr. Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected President of the new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa03">We also particularly welcome the presence here today of Mr. Thabo Mbeki, First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, who played such a prominent part in the struggle of South Africa's people for freedom.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa04">The resolution we have just adopted is essentially a technical one, but its adoption has two very important political messages. Most important, the resolution culminates and symbolizes the achievement of a long-hoped-for but none the less extraordinary event - namely, the achievement of a genuinely united, democratic, non-racial Government for South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa05">Secondly, its adoption demonstrates that the Council is ready to act quickly to lift sanctions imposed against a country once the purpose of the sanctions has been fulfilled. While it is regrettable that the Council has had more occasion to impose sanctions than to lift them, today's vote shows that the Council will not keep sanctions in place any longer than they are necessary.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa06">New Zealand wishes to congratulate the Government and people of South Africa on the remarkable and generally peaceful manner in which they were able to make the transition from the cruel and divisive regime of apartheid to a united, democratic and non-racial country. That last month's elections proceeded so smoothly and were so successful is a testament to the patience, fortitude and good sense of all South Africans.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa07">My country has much in common with South Africa. We are both countries of the southern hemisphere with economies which are heavily dependent on agriculture for our well-being. We know that, even with the mineral wealth with which South Africa has been blessed, it will be no easy task for the new Government to correct the social and economic injustices of the past while maintaining the country on a sound financial footing. We wish the new Government every encouragement as they embark on this important endeavour.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk03-pa08">Internationally, we welcome South Africa into the fold of free and democratic countries. Its size, location and history guarantee that South Africa will play an extremely important role in Africa and in the wider international community, particularly here in the United Nations. We look forward to working constructively with South Africa in pursuit of our common objectives.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kovanda</span> <span class="nation">Czech Republic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa01">My delegation congratulates Nigeria on having seen fit to have you personally, Sir, preside over this particular meeting of the Security Council with this particular agenda, though I assure you that we equally enjoy seeing our good friend Ambassador Gambari in the chair.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa02">Sitting at the table with the First Executive Deputy President, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, is a particular honour and pleasure, and my delegation subscribes to the warm welcome you, Mr. President, extended to him on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa03">Apartheid has fallen, and history will judge who played what role in bringing about its demise. In our estimation, the people of South Africa themselves played the critical part, and we pay homage to those who lost their lives in the process. The leaders of South Africa played their important part, and we salute the perseverance, steadfastness and patience of President Nelson Mandela, as well as the courage and determination of Deputy President Frederik de Klerk. And we, the family of nations, played our own modest role in ostracizing the regime of apartheid and imposing sanctions on it, thereby driving it into an isolated corner reserved for pariahs of the world community.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa04">Today we are witnessing a new South Africa emerging. For most of its population, it represents the dawn of democracy. This is an experience which people of my country can relate to very well, having themselves brought about a democratic transformation less than five years ago. In our experience, we have found that guarantees of democracy include a free press, a market economy, respect for private property and initiative and a civic society - a society of citizens.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa05">This, too, is the direction in which we sense South Africa is heading: the emergence of a society based on citizenship, not on one's mother tongue, not on one's tribal affiliation, least of all based on one's skin colour.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk02-pa06">The Czech Republic, and Czechoslovakia before it, has always supported the struggle of the people of South Africa for a free, multiracial society. We are honoured to have been able to vote today to remove one of the last shackles barring the Republic of South Africa from joining the family of nations as a fully fledged emancipated member. We look forward to completing this process later this year in the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yañez Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa01">The delegation of Spain is very gratified to have you, Sir, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, presiding over our work today. There could be nothing more appropriate on a day such as this than your presence, as an outstanding representative of Nigeria, a country that has distinguished itself in all the international action that has led to the result that we celebrate today. In this context, the work of Ambassador Gambari, as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid, has been particularly effective.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa02">I should like first of all to associate myself with the words of welcome extended to the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa who is here with us today, representing and embodying the new South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa03">The historic decision just adopted by the Council on a date as significant as Africa Day opens the door to the full assumption by South Africa of its proper role in the community of nations. For this reason, we are particularly pleased to have Mr. Thabo Mbeki here with us and to have heard his important message to us. We were also touched by the testimony of a person as distinguished in the struggle against apartheid as Mr. Abdul Minty.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa04">With <a href="../pdf/S-RES-919(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 919 (1994)</a>, the Security Council has brought to an end the mandatory arms embargo imposed on South Africa by <a href="../pdf/S-RES-418(1977).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 418 (1977)</a>. It has also decided to terminate forthwith all other restrictive measures contained in other resolutions of the Security Council, some of which date back to 1963. This entire series of decisions shows the importance the Security Council has attached for many years now, prompted by its African members, to facing up to the challenge presented by the apartheid regime to the international order.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa05">The dismantling of the sanctions regime established by the United Nations against South Africa, stimulated by Mr. Nelson Mandela's historic statement to the Special Committee against Apartheid on 24 September 1993, and initiated by <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-1.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 48/1</a> of 8 October 1993, has culminated with the resolution that we have adopted today.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa06">It is not often that the Security Council decides to lift a sanctions regime. It is always a source of gratification, because it demonstrates that the objectives sought by the international community in imposing these special measures have at last been attained.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa07">My delegation is happy to be participating, together with all the other members of the Council, in this important decision, as a response to the end of the policy of apartheid, which kept the majority of the population of South Africa in squalor, and which trampled underfoot the principle of the equality of all persons and all races. Spain supported the imposition of sanctions when they were adopted, and voted for <a href="../pdf/S-RES-282(1970).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 282 (1970)</a>, because it considered that the apartheid regime in South Africa violated, in its very essence, the most fundamental human values and that it constituted a threat to international peace and security.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa08">The pressures that the international community brought to bear and its condemnation of apartheid, together with the efforts of the people of South Africa, made South Africa radically change its policy and brought about a period of transition, which, with all its difficulties, must be described as exemplary, because of the vision of the future it involved and because of the stature of the main protagonists, Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. de Klerk, who were able to place the interests of the entire population above their different positions. The United Nations Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA) efficiently discharged its mandate of contributing to peace and monitoring the electoral process, in accordance with democratic principles. Spain is proud to have participated with 50 observers in European Union and United Nations missions.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa09">The first multi-racial, multi-party elections, held in South Africa from 26 to 28 April, and the establishment of a united Government, democratic and without racial distinctions, which was inaugurated on 10 May, are irrefutable proof that the South African people have, with great integrity and maturity, taken the reigns of their own destiny, thus winning the admiration of the whole world. We hope that these elections will be the basis for the construction of a future of prosperity in peace and freedom, from which no South African will feel excluded, which we are confident will constitute an invaluable contribution to the stability and progress of southern Africa and the whole African continent.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa10">Aware that we face a new reality in South Africa, Spain shares the firm determination already expressed by the European Union to continue to support the efforts of the new Government to obtain the objective of leading the country towards a democratic, non-racial society in which respect for human rights, both individual and collective, prevails, together with the state of law, the promotion of social justice and the elimination of all forms of discrimination. In this respect, I recall the ministerial decision of the European Union of 19 April this year by which the European Union pledges to take a number of immediate measures to help South Africa in the stage that is now beginning. Those measures include important aspects of trade and development cooperation and the beginning of what we hope will be a fruitful political dialogue. Spain is resolved to deepen its relationship with the new South Africa, as shown by the fact that the Spanish delegation that attended the inauguration of the new President, Mr. Nelson Mandela, on 10 May was headed by His Royal Highness the Prince of Asturias, heir to the Spanish throne.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk04-pa11">While South Africa's future depends more than ever on the South Africans themselves, the international community has a duty to help South Africa to promote the establishment and development of a new country which should be an example to southern Africa and the rest of the continent of what harmony, loyalty and democratic principles can achieve.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Cañas</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa01">The delegation of Argentina wishes to say, Sir, how pleased it is to see you presiding over this historic meeting of the Security Council. We are also very pleased to have with us the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, whom we thank for his important message.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa02">It is not often that the Security Council has the pleasure of adopting a resolution of the type that we have just adopted. The lifting of the mandatory arms embargo and other restrictions against South Africa ends our dealing with a question that the Council first considered in 1960 and marks the culmination of a process whose main protagonist was the people of South Africa, a process benefiting the entire international community.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa03">Our delegation commends the achievements made, in a framework of prudence and moderation, by all the people of South Africa in their struggle for their basic rights and fundamental freedoms and in their efforts to eradicate apartheid and establish a democratic, united, non-racial nation. We also recognize the firm and constant support given to the people of South Africa by the Member States of the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and many non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa04">The Argentine Republic joined the international community in its struggle against apartheid and expressed its constant repudiation of that regime. In the framework of that policy, and as a contribution to that struggle, in May 1986 my country broke off diplomatic relations with South Africa. It resumed them in August 1991 in order to highlight the encouragement it wanted to give to the process of the transformation taking place in that country. We are particularly delighted to see the emergence of a new South Africa, a nation with which we are linked geographically through the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa05">The successful culmination of this process does not prevent our recalling the difficult path that had to be followed, as well as the many lives lost along the way. We pay tribute to those who lost their lives. That history makes all the more significant the commendable tolerance and generosity demonstrated by the political leaders who in 1991 embarked on the irreversible course that led their people to a democratic South Africa. The same high-mindedness and magnanimity will be needed in the new stage that South Africa is now beginning.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa06">All the conditions exist for success, but the after effects of a discriminatory and racist system, which South Africa has just given up, will be hard to eliminate completely. This transformation, reflected in legal and government structures, must also be complemented in the economic and social spheres and in the very mentality of the entire South African people, which for this purpose will have to redouble its efforts and work together in harmony. In this respect, we emphasize the urgent need to complete the process of South Africa's total reintegration into the international community, including the United Nations system, so that it may as quickly as possible take its rightful place and thus make its contribution. In particular, we hope that we shall soon have the active participation of South Africa in the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk02-pa07">Before concluding, I should like to wish President Nelson Mandela, his Government and all the people of South Africa a promising future, a future of peace, and to tell them that they can rely on the friendship and cooperation of the Government and people of my country.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Marker</span> <span class="nation">Pakistan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa01">It is a great honour and pleasure, Sir, for my delegation to greet you today, Africa Day, and to convey our sincerest congratulations on your presiding over the deliberations at this important meeting, of the Security Council, important both in terms of symbol and substance. Not only are you the Foreign Minister of a great country with which Pakistan has the closest and most brotherly relations, but we also had the honour of your presence in my country as Ambassador of Nigeria in Pakistan, where you made a wide array of friends and where your skilful diplomacy left memories as impressive as they are lasting.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa02">My delegation also wishes to extend a warm welcome to the Honourable Mr. Thabo Mbeki, the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, who is no stranger to us. We know him as a valiant freedom fighter, so it was a particular pleasure to greet him today as the distinguished representative of his country and listen to his very thought-provoking statement.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa03">The resolution just adopted by us represents the final step in the dismantlement of the wide-ranging sanctions imposed against South Africa. It also signals the recognition of the reality of a brave new South Africa free of the odious policy of apartheid and its many abhorrent implications. The United Nations itself can rightly claim satisfaction ta the outcome of its prolonged and determinated effort to combat apartheid and to bring to fruition the historic result we have witnessed today.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa04">It is also a happy coincidence that the important decision the Security Council has just formalized through resolution 919 (l994) has been taken during the presidency of Nigeria, a country that has been in the forefront against the struggle against apartheid. In this context, the personal role and contribution of Ambassador Gambari as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid has been crucial and is responsible in large measure for the positive elements that led to the passage of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-919(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 919 (1994)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa05">The Security Council Committee established through resolution 42l (1997) to oversee the implementation of the arms embargo imposed against South Africa has been the longest serving sanctions committee of the Council. As a result of our decision today in the wake of the latest positive developments in South Africa, this Committee has become a part of history. Having served as its Chairman since 1993 my feeling of satisfaction at this moment in the sense of a task well accomplished is more than academic. Today's Security Council resolution also represents another important landmark in the gradual journey of South Africa to join the comity of civilized nations. The transition of South Africa from a society governed by the abhorrent practice of apartheid to a democratic and egalitarian polity has been both tortuous and bloody. It is therefore just and appropriate that we should reiterate our special tribute to the sagacity and vision of the South African leaders, particularly Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. F. W. de Klerk, who have contributed the most in bringing their country to the exhilarating sense of national unity which we witnessed so recently.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa06">The assumption of the office of President by Mr. Nelson Mandela earlier this month, after the first fully democratic elections last month, indeed signifies a triumph of the human spirit. The new Government of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa has already settled down to dealing with the colossal tasks that still lie ahead. As a result of almost 350 years of colonialism, exploitation and apartheid, South Africa had for some time been the most unequalled society in the world. According to one estimate, South Africa's whites, who represent 13 per cent of the country's population, owned 86 per cent of its land and more than 90 per cent of its wealth. Compared to this, almost half of South Africa's 30 million blacks were unemployed. There are many other statistical comparisons available to show the chasm that divides the whites and the blacks in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa07">It is our earnest hope that the new South African leadership will continue to exhibit the same determination, skill and statesmanship in addressing the problems of a unified South Africa as it has done in the transition phase so far. In this endeavour the Government and the people of South Africa need not only the moral and political support of the world at large but also material assistance. We are confident that there will be no dearth of either.</p>
	<p id="pg029-bk02-pa08">May I also take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation and gratitude to all those who facilitated the work of the 421 Committee, as the South Africa Sanctions Committee had come to be known. In this regard, I should like to mention in particular the Secretariat officials who serviced the Committee over so many years with such dedication and diligence. I also wish to thank the delegations concerned for their understanding and cooperation during the few meetings I was privileged to chair. Last but not least, I should like to pay a special tribute to Mr. Minty, whose research and enthusiasm provided the main workload for the Committee.</p>

	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa03">The adoption today of a resolution lifting the mandatory arms embargo and related measures imposed by this Council against the Republic of South Africa brings to an end the series of measures imposed on a pariah regime which, from any perspective, was ill-suited and had no moral justification to chart the destiny of all its people. The installation on 10 May of a democratic Government of a united, non-racial South Africa has closed this tragic chapter on South Africa's dark past. My delegation therefore commends the speed and efficiency with which the Council has acted upon the request of President Nelson Mandela for the lifting of these sanctions. It is indeed significant that the Council met today, on Africa Day, to adopt this historic resolution. Of double significance is the fact that it is today that South Africa became the 53rd member of the Organization of African Unity.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa04">By the lifting of these sanctions, South Africa, a country which once again stands ready to assume its rightful pride of place in the comity of nations, will be able to engage in fruitful cooperation with interested States in the fields of science and technology for development. Whereas the international community has noted with appreciation the assurance given at the beginning of this debate by the First Executive Deputy President of South Africa, His Excellency, Mr. Thabo Mbeki that South Africa will not view the lifting of the embargo as an opportunity to worsen the condition of an already over-armed continent, it is none the less important that these sanctions are lifted to enable the country to decide for itself what economic diversification options it wishes to pursue.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa05">Related to the lifting of the mandatory arms embargo is the dissolution of the relevant Committee of the Security Council established in accordance with rule 28 of its provisional rules of procedure, a Committee whose duty and responsibility it had been to monitor the application and observance by Member States of these sanctions. I would like to place on record my Government's appreciation of the manner in which the Committee performed its duties. Indeed, the Committee did play an additional contributory role in hastening the demise of apartheid and paving the way for the emergence of a united, non-racial, and democratic South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa06">As South Africa reintegrates itself in the international community, my Government is especially delighted to have been associated over the years with the evolutionary process as well as the historic campaign against the obnoxious policy of apartheid designed to perpetuate the subjugation of the majority by the minority in South Africa. In the course of that struggle - and, indeed, as so generously acknowledged by several speakers here today - successive Nigerian Governments and successive generations of the Nigerian people had considered no sacrifice too great nor effort too little as their contribution to the international effort to hasten the end of oppression and injustice which apartheid represented.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa07">In this process, Nigeria had the privilege to participate in and often lead the struggle to bring additional international pressure to bear on the apartheid regime in South Africa. For over two decades Nigeria was honoured to chair the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid, whose contributions were critical to the process of change in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa08">May I say, in conclusion, that my delegation welcomes the birth of a new South Africa. It is our great expectation that with the lifting of the mandatory arms embargo today the new Republic of South Africa will take advantage of its management, trade and industrial capacities to mobilize all its people for the larger goals of justice, peace and development. We are confident that South Africa will be a moving force in the development of the economies in the sub-region and in the African continent at large. In this regard, my country stands ready and looks forward to very active and constructive cooperation with South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa09">I now resume my function as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg030-bk01-pa10">The First Executive Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa has asked to make a statement, and I now call on him.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mbeki</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa01">I thought it might be appropriate, without taking up too much of the Council's time, to express our thanks for statements by members of the Council and members of the United Nations generally, including statements made today, and for the tributes that have been paid to our President Nelson Mandela, to Deputy President de Klerk and to our people generally for the manner in which they have conducted the process of transition in South Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa02">We shall shortly convey to our leadership and our people the sentiments expressed by this Council and the members of the United Nations. We appreciate very much the fact that the Council took a unanimous decision on the resolution before it today.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa03">I am grateful, Mr. President, that you referred to the extent to which our continent is overarmed. Indeed, we thought we needed to indicate in our intervention that it certainly was not our intention to play any such role on the African continent, given South Africa's capacity with regards to armament production; it certainly was not our intention to exploit the Council's decision today to worsen a situation on the African continent which does not need worsening, but needs improvement.</p>
	<p id="pg031-bk01-pa04">I wanted to say &quot;Thank you&quot; for all the kind comments which everybody made, and finally to repeat that we are determined to be a good citizen of the world.</p>
