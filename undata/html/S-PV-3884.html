	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa02">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa03">"The Security Council strongly condemns the armed attack in Angola on 19 May 1998 against personnel from the United Nations and the Angolan National Police, in which one person was killed and three people were seriously injured. It demands that the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation (GURN) and in particular the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) guarantee unconditionally the safety and freedom of movement of all United Nations and other international personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa04">"The Security Council strongly deplores the failure by UNITA to complete the implementation of its remaining obligations under the "Acordos de Paz" (<a href="../pdf/S-22609.pdf" class="nolink">S/22609</a>, annex), the Lusaka Protocol (<a href="../pdf/S-1994-1441.pdf" class="pdf">S/1994/1441</a>, annex) and relevant Security Council resolutions, especially its failure to cooperate in completing the normalization of State administration throughout the national territory, including in particular in Andulo and Bailundo. It also strongly condemns the confirmed attacks by members of UNITA on the personnel of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), international personnel and Angolan national authorities. The Council expresses its deep concern at the serious abuses committed by the Angolan National Police, particularly in areas recently transferred to State administration, as well as at the recent increase in hostile propaganda. The lack of progress in completing the remaining tasks of the peace process has led to a serious deterioration in the military and security situation in the country. The Council calls on the GURN and UNITA in the strongest terms to refrain from any action which might lead to renewed hostilities or derail the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa05">"The Security Council endorses the plan for the completion of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol by 31 May 1998 that was submitted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the Joint Commission on 15 May 1998. The Council demands that the GURN and in particular UNITA fulfil their obligations in accordance with this plan. In this context, the Council reaffirms its readiness to review the measures specified in paragraph 4 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1127(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1127 (1997)</a> of 28 August 1997 and to consider the imposition of additional measures in accordance with paragraphs 8 and 9 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1127(1997).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1127 (1997)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa06">"The Security Council expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, and the personnel of MONUA for their efforts to assist the GURN and UNITA to implement their peace process obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa07">"The Security Council will remain actively seized of this matter."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa08">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-1998-14.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/1998/14</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk09-pa09">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
