	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa01">The United States would like to make a very brief explanation of position.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa02">The United States remains committed to the establishment of a credible tribunal, and supports the substance of the draft resolution before the Assembly; but it will dissociate itself due to concerns about the timing. The United States believes it would have been better to delay consideration of this draft resolution until after the Cambodian National Assembly elections in July.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk01-pa03">At the same time, the United States acknowledges the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Government of Cambodia to reach agreement on the establishment of an extraordinary chamber with international assistance to bring to justice senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge and others who bear the greatest responsibility for atrocities committed. We take note of the commitment shown by a number of nations to establish a credible Khmer Rouge tribunal, especially the original sponsors of the draft resolution -- Japan and France -- as well as Australia, in leading the Friends.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa01">As one of the co-sponsors of the resolution just adopted, I should like to express our gratitude to all Member States for their understanding and support for its adoption without a vote. I also wish to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Hans Corell and his team for their efforts to achieve the agreement between the Secretariat and the Cambodian Government.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa02">We are now definitely one step closer to bringing to justice those most responsible for one of the worst crimes against humanity of the twentieth century. The trials will provide us with an opportunity to help the Cambodian people close that tragic chapter of their history and build a free, accountable and stable society, which in turn will enhance the stability of Indo-China and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. It is also our hope that the Extraordinary Chambers, assisted by the United Nations, will strengthen Cambodia's judicial system, promoting the rule of law and bringing to an end an atmosphere of impunity.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa03">We believe that it is incumbent upon the international community to make the trials a success. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our appeal to all Member States to provide assistance, including financial and personnel support, to the Extraordinary Chambers so that they may begin to function promptly and smoothly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa04">I would also like to stress to Cambodia that, now that the General Assembly has decided to respond positively through the adoption of this resolution to its appeal for cooperation, it is that country's solemn responsibility to take all necessary measures, including prompt ratification of the agreement, to ensure that the Extraordinary Chambers will be able to achieve their objectives to the full.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk05-pa05">In conclusion, let me stress once again that the success of the process leading to credible trials will depend on the efforts and commitment of the parties concerned, together with the understanding and cooperation of all Member States. Japan will continue to cooperate with the Secretariat and the Cambodian Government for the early establishment of the Extraordinary Chambers.</div>
