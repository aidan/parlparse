	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">The 18 outgoing members are: Bulgaria, Chile, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Pakistan, Paraguay, Portugal, Senegal, the United Republic of Tanzania, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">I should like to remind members of the Assembly that, as of 1 January 1997, the following States will continue to be represented on the Economic and Social Council: Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, the Central African Republic, China, Colombia, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, the Czech Republic, Finland, Gabon, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Jordan, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Sudan, Sweden, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. The names of these 36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa04">In accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December 1971, and taking into account the number of States which will remain members of the Council after 1 January 1997, the 18 members should be elected as follows: five from African States, three from Asian States, one from Eastern European States, four from Latin American and Caribbean States, and five from Western European and other States. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa05">I should like to inform the Assembly that the number of candidates, not exceeding the number of seats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and a two-thirds majority of those present and voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates which have obtained an equal number of votes.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa06">May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to this procedure?</p>
