<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Naranjo</span> <span class="nation">Costa Rica</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01">The Government of Costa Rica, in its capacity as spokesman and Secretary <i>pro tempore </i>of the Central American Presidential Summits, is profoundly pleased by the decision being taken today in the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">The signing of the peace agreements in Guatemala on 29 December 1996 was the culmination of a difficult peacemaking process in the region of more than a decade. It is with great joy that we in Central America are celebrating this historic event. There is peace in Nicaragua, there is peace in El Salvador, and now, after 36 years, Guatemala, our dear sister country, is also achieving peace.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">Today Central America, in peace and freedom, and deeply committed to respect for human rights and for the environment, is preparing to meet the challenges of the future in the framework of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America. This unique experience unites the seven small countries of our isthmus more than ever.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">All Central Americans are profoundly grateful to all members of the Council for the decision that is being taken this afternoon, which will make it possible for a United Nations contingent to verify compliance with the peace agreements in Guatemala. We are especially grateful to you, Mr. President, and to you, Mr. Secretary-General, for your endeavours to achieve a satisfactory agreement. We express our respect and appreciation to China for its support for this decision, which is crucial for the completion of the process of peacemaking and democratization in Central America. We again offer our appreciation and thanks to the countries of the Group of Friends of Guatemala, which have helped and cooperated so much in this process. And to the people and the Government of Guatemala in particular, we offer our sincerest congratulations.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Costa Rica for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">We voted against the draft resolution on sending military observers to Guatemala when it was considered by the Council on 10 January 1997. We made it clear then that that was not a situation that we wanted to see. The causes of the situation were clearly set out in the statement that I made on that occasion, and I shall not repeat them here today.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">The Chinese Government has consistently supported the peace process in Guatemala and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. We welcome and are gratified by the peace agreement reached by the two parties in Guatemala. We are in favour of the peace process in Guatemala, monitored by and under the auspices of the United Nations, and sincerely hope that peace and stability will prevail in the country. Therefore, we have always kept the door wide open to an appropriate solution of the issue and have hoped to find such a solution through consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">It is in this spirit of sincerity that we have had many rounds of fruitful consultations with Guatemala over the past 10 days. The two sides, guided by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and through a forward-looking, pragmatic approach, have finally found a solution acceptable to both sides, thereby removing the obstacles to China's support for the draft resolution before us. We view Guatemala's constructive move positively.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">Here we wish to express our appreciation to the President and other members of the Council, the Group of Friends of the Guatemalan Peace Process, the non-aligned and all other countries concerned about the Guatemalan peace process for their understanding and support.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">We sincerely hope that the peace process in Guatemala will ultimately succeed, allowing Guatemala to enjoy true peace and stability, create an environment conducive to its future economic reconstruction and embark on the road of healthy development. We also hope that the basis for cooperation between China and Guatemala in the United Nations will thus be further strengthened, thereby creating favourable conditions for the future development of relations between our two countries.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk06">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Secretary-General</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa01">I have been most gratified to learn that the obstacles that stood in the way of the Security Council's being able to authorize deployment of a group of United Nations military observers to verify compliance with the agreement on the definitive ceasefire in Guatemala have been overcome.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa02">In recent weeks, the Secretariat has undertaken intensive consultations on this matter with the parties concerned and encouraged them to find the common ground that would allow passage of this resolution to go forward. I therefore welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the constructive approach demonstrated by the Member States most directly involved and the efforts of the Group of Friends of the Guatemalan Peace Process in their support. The adoption by the Security Council of the resolution before it will allow for the effective verification of one of the most crucial elements of Guatemala's transition to peace and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa03">The United Nations has been involved in the Guatemalan process since it was first asked to provide an observer to the peace talks in 1990. Since 1994 it has played a particularly active role, both through moderation of the peace negotiations and in the deployment of the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala. The signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace in Guatemala City on 29 December 1996 opens a new chapter in the United Nations responsibilities. As we prepare for the overall verification contemplated by the various accords, I am pleased to acknowledge the support of the Security Council and Member States at large for what we all hope will become recognized as one of the Organization's success stories.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Martini Herrera</span> <span class="nation">Guatemala</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">I wish simply to express briefly my delegation's satisfaction that this moment of historic importance for Guatemala has come under your presidency, Sir, and in the presence of the Foreign Minister of Costa Rica and the Secretary-General, and that the Security Council has fulfilled its weighty peacekeeping responsibilities so commendably and to the great benefit of my country.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">I need not repeat the ideas put forward in the excellent statements in support of the draft resolution considered at the Council's first meeting of the year, but I should like once again to express our gratitude for them. I assure members that the considerations put forward in those statements are sufficient grounds for the great satisfaction felt at this moment by the people and the Government of Guatemala, as we see that the obstacles that made it impossible for the necessary measures to be taken to pursue the peace process with United Nations participation have been overcome.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">Therefore, on behalf of my people and Government, I have the pleasure to convey our satisfaction and profound gratitude through you, Mr. President, to each and every member of the Security Council -- and in particular to one whose understanding has earned our special thanks -- as well as to the Secretariat and all the countries that have striven towards this moment, for the critical contribution that the Council has just made to the normalization of the living conditions and to the well-being of the long-suffering people of Guatemala, who deserve a better fate than that which the persistence of the sterile domestic conflict and its attendant suffering seemed to hold in store.</p>
