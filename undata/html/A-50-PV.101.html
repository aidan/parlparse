Our deepest sympathies also go to Her Majesty Queen Mamohato Bereng Seeiso and the members of the bereaved family in their hour of grief.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa02">King Moshoeshoe II belonged to the generation of leaders who led their countries not only in the colonial era, but in subsequent independence from colonialism. It may be recalled that while he was installed as paramount chief of the Basotho nation in 1960, he assumed the title of King when Lesotho's independence was restored in 1966.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg001-bk08-pa03">As a constitutional monarch he was actively associated with improving the welfare of the Basotho people and placed particular importance on education and social development, which he considered the keys to the progress of his nation.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg002-bk07-pa03">His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II earned widespread respect in the international community, enjoying exceptional moral authority in his country and abroad. He was a man with a profound interest in the welfare of the Basotho people and had great interest in education and social development, which he rightly considered to be the keys to the development and progress of his people. Good examples of this are the Mohato Scholarship Fund and the Moshoeshoe II High School Scholarship Fund, which were created to aid Basotho youngsters in furthering their education.</div>

During those three decades, the shape of Africa and the world was changed for ever. Colonialism disappeared amidst the unstoppable march towards freedom and democracy. King Moshoeshoe lived to see that triumphant procession culminate in the final elimination of the apartheid that had surrounded his Kingdom. The men and women of a new Africa now are called on to take the place of King Moshoeshoe and the people of his generation, who laboured so hard to taste the fruits of freedom. His example will inspire them all.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa01">In the early morning hours of Monday, 15 January this year, His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II died in a car accident in the mountains of Lesotho, a terrain that is as forbidding as it is beautiful. His Majesty loved to travel in the countryside and admire the boundless beauty that is to be found there. On that fateful day, however, his mission was to go and inspect his livestock, which, in accordance with an old custom, had been sent out to pasture in the highlands, where conditions are more favourable for grazing.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa02">The loss of the King plunged the country into an abyss of grief and shock. The nation could not believe that the end of his life had come at such an early age and in circumstances that security and safety arrangements reserved for Heads of State are supposed to guard against. The message was driven home that death and the manner in which it occurs know no bounds of age or birth.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa03">The late King was born Constantine Bereng Seeiso in 1938 and assumed the name Moshoeshoe II upon ascending to the throne. Our first monarch to receive a modern education, he went to school in Lesotho and England and completed degrees in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University and in law at Warwick University in the United Kingdom. His university training imbued him with an abiding concern for the protection of human rights, and he devoted his life to that cause.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa04">During his reign, Lesotho went through some of the most trying times of its history as a sovereign African State completely surrounded by a hostile apartheid regime that had no regard for the worth of people of African origin. The nadir of relations between Lesotho and South Africa was reached in December 1982, when apartheid South Africa mounted a savage attack on the homes of members of the South African liberation movements exiled in Lesotho, an attack that was strongly condemned by the whole world.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa05">Speaking against this brutality before the Security Council on 14 December 1982, six days after the attack, King Moshoeshoe said:</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa06">"The reasons [for apartheid South Africa's aggression] are well known to the members of the international community. In the first place, the Pretoria regime resents our oft-expressed abhorrence, in line with the whole of civilized mankind, of the obnoxious policy of apartheid. They hope to intimidate us into dissociating ourselves from the world-wide condemnation of the policy of apartheid and from offering moral support to the oppressed people of South Africa in their struggle for justice, freedom and equality." (<i>S/PV.2406, pp. 12-15</i>)</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg003-bk04-pa07">Lesotho has lost one of its most illustrious sons, and, on behalf of the Government and people of the Kingdom of Lesotho, I thank you, Mr. President, the Ambassadors of Tanzania, Belarus and Portugal and the representatives of Colombia and India, speaking for the various regional groupings; and the representative of the United States for their kind words and tribute to the memory of our late King. I shall not fail to convey your and their sentiments to His Majesty King Letsie III, the present monarch, and his Government.</div>

	<div class="spokentext">
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa01">Members will recall that at its 77th plenary meeting, on 1 December 1995, the General Assembly decided to include this sub-item in the agenda of its fiftieth session and to consider it directly in plenary meeting.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa02">In accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1018(1995).pdf">resolution 1018 (1995)</a>, adopted by the Security Council on 7 November 1995, the General Assembly will proceed to the election of a member of the International Court of Justice for the unexpired term of office of the deceased Judge Andrés Aguilar Mawdsley of Venezuela.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa03">In connection with this election, I should like to bring the following matters to the attention of the members of the General Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa04">First, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 264 (III) of 8 October 1948, a State which is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice but not a Member of the United Nations shall participate in the General Assembly in electing the members of the Court in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations. On this occasion I am happy to welcome here the representatives of Nauru and Switzerland.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa05">Secondly, I should like to confirm that at this time the Security Council, independently of the General Assembly, is also proceeding to elect one member of the Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article 8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa06">"The General Assembly and the Security Council shall proceed independently of one another to elect the members of the Court."</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa07">Accordingly, the results of the voting in the General Assembly will not be communicated to the Security Council until one candidate has obtained the required majority in the Assembly.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the documents relating to the election. The Assembly has before it document <a href="../pdf/A-50-865.pdf">A/50/865</a>, which contains a memorandum by the Secretary-General on the present composition of the Court and the procedure to be followed in the General Assembly and in the Security Council with regard to the election; documents <a href="../pdf/A-50-866.pdf">A/50/866</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-50-866-Add.1.pdf">A/50/866/Add.1</a>, which contain the names of candidates who have been nominated by national groups within the required time for submission, that is, by 2 February 1996; document <a href="../pdf/A-50-882.pdf">A/50/882</a>, providing information concerning nominations received from national groups after 2 February 1996; and document <a href="../pdf/A-50-867.pdf">A/50/867</a>, which contains the curricula vitae of the candidates nominated by national groups.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa09">In accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly and in the Security Council shall be considered as elected.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk01-pa10">The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words "absolute majority" as meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this purpose, are all 185 Member States and the two non-member States: Nauru and Switzerland. Accordingly, 94 votes constitute an absolute majority for the purpose of electing a judge of the International Court of Justice.</div>

	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Allow me first to express thanks for this opportunity to speak, though my delegation is truly sorry to ask to speak at this particular moment.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa02">Our delegation, like some 40 others, was surprised this morning, before we began the procedure of electing a judge to the International Court of Justice, by the letter contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-50-888.pdf">A/50/888</a>. With regard to Syria's contribution to the regular budget of the United Nations for 1995, and in accordance with the letter sent by the Secretary-General to Member States, States can pay a minimum amount and remain within the terms of Article 19 of the Charter. In fact, the Syrian Government has paid an amount which is equivalent to half Syria's assessment, which is five times the required minimum.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa03">With regard to the budget of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine (UNTSO), the Syrian Government paid the equivalent of half the Syrian assessment on 1 November 1995. However, this morning the Committee on Contributions said that it had not been informed of this payment by its office in Damascus. At this very moment, the Secretary of the Committee is inquiring into the matter.</div>
	<div class="p" id="pg006-bk02-pa04">Unlike delays by some other Member States, Syria's is not due to inability or unwillingness to pay its contributions. However, there are certain procedures that we must take into account in our country, such as approval by our Parliament. Our delegation hopes that, in view of the fact that the contributions of the States on this list represent less than one half of one per cent of the United Nations budget, you, Mr. President, will bring the matter before the General Assembly and will ask that Article 19 of the Charter not be applied at this meeting, in view of the importance of the election taking place today. Furthermore, in view of the support deserved by a judge on the International Court of Justice, we hope that you will take the necessary measures, while knowing that the letter from the Secretary-General forewarned Member States of the possible consequences of failure to pay their contributions. We hope that your wisdom will prevail, Sir.</div>

I have just been informed by the Secretariat that no payment has been received as of this morning from any country besides those two that were previously reported. Any questions concerning matters contained in the letter from the Secretary-General should be referred to the Comptroller of the United Nations. Considering that no further payment has been received and that we should comply with Article 19 of the Charter, my decision is that we should go ahead with the election.</div>
