	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">I give the floor to Mr. Annabi.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Annabi</span> <span class="non-nation">Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">As the President of the Council has just noted, members of the Council will have seen the Secretary-General's report dated 26 July, which provides a fairly detailed account of developments in East Timor over the past six months. I will therefore limit myself to highlighting some of the most important issues dealt with in the report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">The humanitarian emergency which faced the United Nations following the popular consultation in August last year has been largely overcome, but the reconstruction of the destroyed infrastructure of East Timor and the rebuilding of public services from scratch are huge tasks. Significant progress has been made, and the basic governance and administration structures are now in place. There remains, however, a lot of work to be done to reactivate the economy and strengthen the delivery of basic services while maintaining a stable security environment. The situation of the refugees still in West Timor also remains a matter of serious and increasing concern.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I will deal first with political developments. Over the past six months we have seen the extension of the sharing of political decision-making. The most significant steps in this regard have been the creation of a transitional Cabinet, half of whose members are Timorese heads of government departments, and the establishment of the National Council. The Cabinet enables the Timorese to assume government responsibilities for the first time. The National Council will broaden participation in the legislative consultation process by including new sectors of the population that were not represented directly in its predecessor, the National Consultative Council. It will include members from the rural districts, whose circumstances are quite different from those of the capital, Dili.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">The immediate challenge is to ensure that this National Council is constituted in such a way that it is part of a process of consensus building, as open political activity and debate occur for the first time in East Timor. We should listen carefully, for example, to the youth and students who have been so active in the pro-independence movement and who are becoming increasingly vocal in their demands. As the Secretary-General has emphasized, there is a pressing need to strengthen tolerance for political bodies outside the broad umbrella of the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT), religious groups and ethnic minorities.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">The CNRT, which is the largest and most representative coalition of political forces in East Timor, will hold its conference in August -- next month. This will be a very important public policy forum and should significantly advance the debate on the key issues of the new constitution and the timetable for the holding of elections. A major political challenge in this period is to maintain unity of purpose among the Timorese while promoting the broadest possible political participation. There have been a number of political protest demonstrations this year, largely over employment and economic issues, but fortunately they have not caused any major security problems.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">I turn now to the subject of relations with Indonesia. As described in the Secretary-General's report, relations with the Indonesian Government have advanced considerably. There are, however, a number of key outstanding issues. The central issue requiring urgent attention and action concerns the refugees in West Timor. The very unsatisfactory situation of the refugees in the camps in West Timor is reflected in the priorities that have been drawn up by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for guaranteeing the security of the refugees and its own humanitarian workers. These include the separation of former Indonesian soldiers, police and civil servants from the bulk of the refugees. The failure to guarantee the security situation in the refugee camps is illustrated by the recent withdrawal of UNHCR staff from the camps following attacks on UNHCR personnel. This clearly is not a context in which the refugees can freely decide whether they wish to return or be resettled elsewhere.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">The Government of Indonesia should be encouraged to ensure that the influence of militias in the refugee camps and their activities in the border area are brought to an immediate end. The continued existence of the pro-integration militias and their evident capacity to operate along the border is fundamental to the central issue of border security. In this connection, I would like to mention that yesterday in Geneva the High Commissioner for Refugees highlighted these concerns about the situation of the refugees and of UNHCR's own staff in West Timor by issuing a background paper, which we would be happy to make available to interested Council members.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">While security has been stable throughout the rest of the country, allowing an initial reduction in the strength of the peacekeeping force, military component of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), the past six months have seen periods of calm interrupted by violent incidents and incursions across the border. Very regrettably, these culminated earlier this week with the killing of a member of the New Zealand contingent of UNTAET in the Cova Lima district, which is located along the southern border with West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">At the suggestion of Indonesian officials, a joint investigation involving UNTAET will begin on Monday.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">In this context, on behalf of the Secretary-General I would like to extend our profound condolences to the family of the New Zealand soldier who was killed in this incident, and to express appreciation to all his colleagues who have been working with UNTAET on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">I turn to the question of law and order. There has been a somewhat worrisome increase in thefts and violent crime, mainly in Dili, which has also seen some youth gang activity. Following a large gang fight in April, the decision was taken to make side arms available to the United Nations civilian police when necessary. The reduction of urban unemployment and of the drift from the countryside to the cities -- which appear to be the main causes of this problem -- remain a priority.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">The evolution of the thinking of the East Timorese about the defence requirements of the future independent State has led to the commissioning of a study of future defence needs and their financial and practical implications for East Timor. The study, as Council members are aware, is being conducted by King's College, London. The team is currently completing its work in East Timor. While we await the final report of this team, we understand that three options will be proposed. All assume that the Falintil will be at the core of a new defence or security force, which will require significant international aid and training. Meanwhile, provision has been made for the basic needs of Falintil troops, many of whom have been allowed to go home on leave.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">The Secretary-General observed in his report that East Timor's best assurance for a secure future lies in healthy relations with the countries in the region, particularly Indonesia. In this connection, I should mention that, at the invitation of the Government of Thailand, a delegation from East Timor, comprised of Mr. Vieira de Mello, Mr. Xanana Gusmão and others, attended the annual meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was held in Thailand on 24 and 25 July.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">I turn briefly to the economic situation. Given the levels of destruction and disruption which East Timor suffered in the wake of the popular consultation last year, the reactivation of the economy is clearly a long-term task that will continue well after independence. The reconstruction of essential buildings is proceeding, but not as quickly as many would hope. We are encouraged, however, that it has been possible to reach agreement with the Timorese political leaders on a modest budget of $59 million for next year. This will require an additional subsidy from voluntary contributions. I would like to take this opportunity to thank donors for their support since the Tokyo Conference last year and during the recent Conference held in Lisbon last month.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">In conclusion, I would like to say that, as we look back over the past six months, we can all feel satisfied about the progress that UNTAET has been able to achieve, even if it has not yet reached full capacity. It has contributed to the alleviation of the emergency brought about by the violence and destruction of last year; it has maintained a secure environment; it has established the foundations of an effective administration; and, above all, it has established a relationship of mutual respect and trust with the East Timorese. At the same time, the last six months have underscored the fact that the task that the United Nations and the international community have undertaken in East Timor is a truly daunting one, and that, as I stated at the beginning of this briefing, there is still a lot of work ahead of us.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">The international community's commitment in East Timor will have to be sustained well beyond independence, which the East Timorese hope to reach by the end of next year. UNTAET will continue to do everything possible, with the Council's support, to assist the East Timorese to prepare for this challenge.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chowdhury</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to thank you, Madam President, for scheduling this public meeting on the situation in East Timor. Let me begin by thanking Mr. Annabi for introducing the latest report of the Secretary-General and for his additional remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">The Secretary-General's report covers a number of significant developments in East Timor over the last six months. We take great pleasure in acknowledging once again the crucial role that the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) is playing in confronting the numerous challenges facing the territory of East Timor under the creditable leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Sergio Vieira de Mello. We heard from him last month about the idea of broadening the participation in governance of the East Timorese leadership. We support this initiative, as we have always advocated Timorese ownership of the development efforts. We welcome, therefore, the creation of the National Council that replaces the National Consultative Council. This is a significant development on the path to democratic and representative governance.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">While the vibrant nature of political expression is nothing unexpected for the people of East Timor, who are passing through turbulent times, we would like to sound a word of caution for the leaders and opinion-makers: they should take the utmost care not to allow intolerance of political expression and religious and ethnic sensitivities to take root. We say this because we notice certain tendencies in these directions. We would fully endorse UNTAET initiatives in the areas of civic and political education and establishment of the rule of law.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">We also note with satisfaction that UNTAET's policy of information and communication is being strengthened, which we believe is crucial not only to enhance confidence in UNTAET activities, but also to inculcate in the East Timorese population respect for others' rights. The role of close consultation with interlocutors, with regard to tolerance of the views of other political groups, is indisputable. It would be a cruel irony if yesterday's minority failed to adopt a culture of tolerance towards today's minority and resorted to an attitude of intimidation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa05">As in our last meeting, we have heard about the continuing problem of militia activity. In the last few weeks UNTAET positions have been attacked, and very recently a peacekeeper was shot dead. We take this opportunity to express our sincere condolences to his bereaved family and salute his courage and commitment to a noble cause. We convey our condolences to the Government of New Zealand, the country from which this peacekeeper came. We are very much concerned at this dangerous trend, which has the potential of undoing the good work done so far by UNTAET and the goodwill and cooperation that the Indonesian Government has shown. We recognize the determined efforts being made by the Indonesian Government in this regard. Clearly, there is need to do much more in order to terminate, once and for all, the continuing militia activity in the areas bordering East Timor. We are confident that the Indonesian Government will put a high priority on this aspect and take all necessary steps.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa06">We are also very concerned at the recent spate of attacks on the property and personnel of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Their safety and security is uppermost in our mind, as we feel that they are playing a pivotal role in the whole process of ensuring a rapid return of the refugees to East Timor. It is incumbent on the Indonesian authorities to ensure the safety of all aid workers in West Timor and to secure the refugee camps against the incessant attacks of the armed elements. The recurrence of these incidents does not augur well for the stalled repatriation process. It is also not in the interest of the Government of Indonesia to allow its commitment to falter due to the criminal activities of the militia and their accomplices. The other issue that has not been attended to is that of payment of pensions to the civil servants. We invite the Indonesian authorities to take necessary steps soon to reach a solution. This would give a long awaited fillip to the repatriation of refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa07">We encourage the ongoing process of investigation of human rights violations that occurred in the wake of the referendum last year. We deeply appreciate the efforts being made by the office of the Indonesian Attorney-General. We hope that all concerned will endeavour not to allow any delay in this process.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa08">Before concluding, let me touch upon the issue of transition to independence. We have said earlier that realistic benchmarks, and not an arbitrary time-frame, should be the guiding factor. Bangladesh believes that the process of transition will be slow and long. To our mind, haste should be avoided. Consultation with the national leadership, as well as regular feedback to the Security Council, would be our proposal in the setting of those benchmarks. We consider it very important that the people of East Timor, through their own leadership, perceive these benchmarks as milestones in their quest for national development that can rejuvenate, and not dampen, their spirits.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Harrison</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report, and Mr. Annabi for his introductory remarks this morning. The report is a very useful one. It contains some good news and some frustrations. It also reports a tragedy.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa02">To start with the good news, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) has made excellent progress in building the administration of East Timor. Most important, the Mission has taken real steps to involve the East Timorese people in the running of their territory. We praise Mr. Vieira de Mello for the establishment on 14 July of the National Council, and we congratulate UNTAET on the steps it has taken to reorganise itself, thus increasing the direct participation of the East Timorese. These steps are not only important in terms of accountability and legitimacy; they are also a crucial contribution to capacity-building for self-government in East Timor. They should be strengthened in the coming months.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa03">Another welcome development was the East Timor donor conference held in Lisbon from 21 to 23 June. The United Kingdom is very encouraged by UNTAET's efforts to simplify its procedures. But we are in no position to be complacent. UNTAET and the donor community should step up their efforts to ensure the delivery of practical benefits to the East Timorese people. As the Secretary-General's report makes clear, the need is great. An essential first step in this regard would be the establishment by UNTAET and by the World Bank of measurable performance indicators; this would allow them to judge their progress in the coming months. UNTAET and the World Bank should also provide regular reports on what they have achieved.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa04">The third piece of good news in the report was the work that is being done on East Timor's future defence and security needs and on their practical and financial implications. The United Kingdom is very pleased to have been able to provide funding for this valuable work. The final decision will be for the East Timorese people themselves, not for UNTAET or the international community. We encourage the East Timorese people to have the broadest possible debate on the options before them.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa05">One of the key voices in that debate will be Falintil. As one of the main forces in East Timor's independence movement, Falintil could reasonably have expected to have benefited in the same way as the military wings of successful independence movements elsewhere have benefited. But because the United Nations is the administering power, they have not so benefited. Neither has their role been given the recognition it deserves. Their forces remain cantoned, with nothing to do and with no role to play, 11 months after the ballot. The provision of $100,000 from the UNTAET budget to meet Falintil's immediate humanitarian needs is a welcome first step. We need to consider carefully what more the United Nations could do to address this problem. I would welcome the views of the Secretariat on this point.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa06">The section of the report on the refugee situation makes for enormously frustrating reading. Why is it that so many refugees remain in camps in West Timor, 11 months after the ballot? Why is it that those camps remain largely under the control of the thuggish pro-integration militias? And why have we allowed their acts of violence and intimidation against personnel of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to reach the level they have, to the point that UNHCR was forced to postpone indefinitely the vital effort to register the refugees and to determine whether they wanted to return to East Timor or to be resettled elsewhere?</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa07">This situation is deplorable. It cannot be allowed to continue. The registration process must be completed quickly to enable the repatriation or resettlement of the remaining refugees before the next rainy season. With this in mind, UNHCR has set the Government of Indonesia a deadline of 31 October. By that date, they must restore law and order in and around the camps. They must arrest those who are attempting to sabotage the resettlement process for their own sinister reasons. We expect the Government of Indonesia to take determined, concrete and effective measures to meet that deadline, and to meet it in good time.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa08">The continuing failure to resolve the issue of militias in West Timor has a destabilizing effect on East Timor itself. The Secretary-General's report shows a period of sporadic but continuing cross-border incursions. These culminated in the tragic murder on Monday this week of Private Leonard William Manning. We have all expressed our most profound sympathies to Private Manning's family and to the Government and the people of New Zealand. But sympathy is not enough. We must together show our determination that such an outrage will not happen again. We have a duty to Private Manning and to his colleagues, because they were sent to East Timor to implement the Security Council's resolution, <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1272 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa09">First, we hope that the Secretary-General will conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and will report to the Council on his findings as soon as possible. Secondly, the United Kingdom expects the Government of Indonesia to redouble its efforts to cooperate with UNTAET on the problem of cross-border incursions. They must disarm and disband the militias. And they must hunt down those responsible for Private Manning's killing and for other militia activities, and bring them to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa10">My delegation believes that this report by the Secretary-General provides a good point at which the Council can take stock of the situation in East Timor. We have therefore distributed a draft presidential statement which, with the assistance of our colleagues, we hope the Council will adopt as soon as possible next week. The statement will need to reflect the good news, the frustrations and the tragedy of which I have spoken. But we hope that the statement will also look forward. We should not forget that Private Manning died serving a wider goal. That goal was the implementation of the will of the East Timorese people, so unequivocally expressed on 30 August last year. UNTAET has made good progress in implementing the result of the ballot during this year. We look forward to renewed efforts to drive forward this vital agenda in the coming months.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Listre</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa01">I wish first of all to thank the Secretary-General for the comprehensive report contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2000-738.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/738</a>, and to thank Mr. Hédi Annabi for his statement this morning. I wish also to express the gratitude of my delegation for the excellent work being done in East Timor by the United Nations Transitional Administrator, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. My congratulations go also to all personnel of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) on the excellent job they are doing.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa02">The United Nations has taken up a major challenge in undertaking the administration of East Timor and preparing it for independence. In that connection, the report of the Secretary-General indicates the scale and excellent quality of the work that has been carried out thus far. But we know that a great deal remains to be done to lay the foundations for a politically stable and economically prosperous East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa03">A key political factor is the training of local leaders so that they can guide the country's future once the United Nations leaves. Here we welcome the recent initiative to include four Timorese officials in the transitional cabinet, because this will help familiarize them with the administrative work that will be their sole responsibility in the future. We also see as very positive the transformation of the National Consultative Council into a more broadly representative National Council with greater authority.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa04">In addition to the goal of increasing the direct participation and responsibility of the Timorese in the political arena, we believe that the people should be prepared for democratic elections. That is why we consider very timely the creation of the UNTAET programme entitled "The future of democracy in East Timor" whose objective it is to promote civic education, constitutional development, the rule of law and political education. In this context, we support efforts aimed at developing a culture of tolerance in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa05">From the economic perspective, international assistance has contributed to the rehabilitation of the infrastructure of the territory and to job creation. The main challenge for the future is to facilitate the creation of conditions to ensure that the Timorese economy can generate its own resources. We therefore believe it necessary to continue to make efforts to promote appropriate development of agriculture, which provides 80 per cent of the food for the population, and the oil industry -- two sectors in the territory with good prospects.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa06">We cannot fail to draw attention to the fact that, in contrast to the progress achieved in the political and economic areas, one serious problem has not been resolved satisfactorily, despite the passage of time. I refer to the suffering of the thousands of refugees who remain in West Timor. I should like to express the profound concern of my delegation about the seriousness of the current situation, particularly in certain areas where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has had to suspend important activities, such as the registration of refugees, because of intimidation by militias against UNHCR workers. My delegation trusts that the Indonesian authorities will continue to display a constructive approach in the framework of respect for the commitments undertaken, so as to resolve this serious problem.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk01-pa07">We note the Secretary-General's intention to make a major reduction in the force if the situation remains stable in the eastern sector, and also to reduce significantly the number of military observers. We would like additional information from the Secretary-General as to whether the conditions in the field are such that a reduction would be truly appropriate, particularly given the recent events that led to the death of a peacekeeper from New Zealand, on which we await clarification. We take this opportunity to express our very sincere condolences to the family of Mr. William Manning and extend our sympathy to the Government and people of New Zealand.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Andjaba</span> <span class="nation">Namibia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I thank the Secretary-General for his report on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and Mr. Annabi for the additional information that he has provided.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa02">I wish to begin my statement by addressing the significant assessment, in paragraph 62 of the report, which falls under the heading, "Humanitarian affairs", that "the immediate emergency is considered over" and that a country-wide review of the humanitarian operation concluded that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg007-bk01-pa03">"humanitarian assistance had been delivered in a timely and effective manner."</blockquote>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa04">If we recall the widespread destruction of last year and the humanitarian catastrophe that was unfolding in East Timor, we see that the present situation is testimony to what can be achieved to address such situations if the international community summons the political will to launch concerted efforts to address situations of potentially catastrophic proportions.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa05">UNTAET can, indeed, look with satisfaction on what it has achieved so far, especially if judged by the daunting tasks it faced at deployment and is still facing. My delegation is, however, convinced that many of the successes resulted from the professional and often ingenious manner in which Mr. Vieira de Mello and his staff took on their challenges. I should like to refer to some of the methods adopted that will play a major role in the eventual final success of the UNTAET mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa06">First, Mr. Vieira de Mello made the decision to remain at all times in close consultation with the East Timorese people in the decision-making process. This was mainly achieved through the establishment of the National Consultative Council, which has now become the National Council, to allow for the broader participation of the East Timorese and ensure that they become the major stakeholders in their own system of government and public administration.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa07">Secondly, it was decided to establish a transitional Cabinet, with the East Timorese holding the portfolios of administration, infrastructure, economy and social affairs. This move will provide the East Timorese with excellent preparation for their future governmental responsibilities.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa08">Thirdly, a continuous effort has been made to promote national reconciliation in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa09">My delegation also welcomes the ongoing efforts to normalize relations between East Timor and Indonesia: the value of mutual visits in strengthening bilateral relations cannot be over-emphasized. This process remains essential for future regional cooperation between the two countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa10">With regard to the ongoing rebuilding and rehabilitation process in East Timor, my delegation wishes to stress the importance of the private sector's becoming involved in the creation of employment opportunities, because of the temporary nature of the successful quick-impact projects. We also strongly support the number of projects in progress geared towards human resource development, and my delegation looks forward to the reopening of the national university of East Timor in October.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa11">My delegation is also concerned about the situation of Falintil, which is currently under cantonment, with no clear idea about its future. We therefore support any outcome of the studies under way which would put Falintil at the core of a future national security force.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa12">My delegation welcomes the continuing repatriation of East Timorese refugees from West Timor and would like to reiterate its satisfaction at the smooth reintegration of returning refugees into their original communities. We are, however, concerned about the fate of the refugees who remain in the camps in West Timor, and hope that their repatriation to East Timor will take place as soon as possible. We deplore the ongoing acts of intimidation and violence by militias against refugees and relief workers. We trust that urgent measures will be taken to ensure their safety and that UNHCR will be allowed to continue its work without hindrance.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa13">The number of border incidents decreased following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding regarding tactical coordination in the border area between UNTAET and Indonesia. However, the tragic event of 24 July, when Private Manning was killed, stressed the urgent need for further effective steps to disarm and disband militia groups. In this connection, I wish to extend our sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the Government of New Zealand and the bereaved family.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa14">My delegation notes the opposite situation that prevails in the eastern sector, which prompted the Secretary-General's intention to begin troop reduction. We support that intention and the proposed reduction of military observers.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa15">In conclusion, my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to Mr. Vieira de Mello and his staff for a job well done.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wang Yingfan</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">The Chinese delegation thanks the Secretary-General for his report and is grateful for the briefing provided by the Assistant Secretary-General, Mr. Annabi.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa02">There has been some gratifying progress recently in East Timor's political life. After extensive consultations, the National Council was established, with the participation of the representatives of all the political parties and other parties. The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and the East Timorese people have jointly formed a Cabinet to jointly decide and discuss State affairs. These measures have truly demonstrated the principle of emphasizing the Timorese people themselves. This can increase their self-confidence and their trust in the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa03">We believe that the East Timorese people, through greater participation in the work of the transitional period, which could thus be speeded up, and with the help of the international community, can achieve self-government and self-reliance at an early date.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa04">In terms of economic rehabilitation, housing and infrastructure reconstruction, preservation of the social order and security, legislation, employment creation and training of the local people, UNTAET has achieved obvious progress. We thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Vieira de Mello, and his staff for the huge amount of work they have done to achieve this progress. We support the efforts that UNTAET has made to promote the achievement of political democracy and reconciliation among the various parties. I wish to emphasize that in this process it is necessary always to respect local tradition and culture and the will and choices of the local people.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa05">We are concerned about the situation of the refugees remaining in West Timor. We hope that UNTAET can continue to consult with the Government of Indonesia to settle this problem.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa06">We welcome the maintenance of good, cooperative relations in all aspects between East Timor and the Government of Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa07">The general security situation in East Timor is stable. However, there have been some recent incidents of violence that are very disquieting. We condemn violent attacks against the United Nations peacekeepers and express our condolences to the family of the peacekeeper from New Zealand who was killed. We await the outcome of the investigation of this incident.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa08">We trust that the Indonesian Government will continue to fulfil its commitments and take measures to ensure security in the East Timor border areas.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Granovsky</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his second report on the activity of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and to Assistant Secretary-General Mr. Annabi for his statement at this meeting. The Russian delegation fully shares the report's assessments and conclusions.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa02">In preparing for today's meeting on East Timor, we experienced mixed feelings. On the one hand, the positive results of UNTAET activity to normalize life in the territory have been obvious. On the other hand, we have recently received a number of alarming reports, the culmination of which was the news of the death of a New Zealand peacekeeper serving in the military component of UNTAET. The circumstances which have come to light regarding the tragedy attest to unceasing armed attacks by the opponents of the independence of East Timor. We associate ourselves with the demands of other States that decisive measures be taken to prevent a repetition of such incidents.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa03">We are also alarmed by the conclusions of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees regarding the situation in the refugee camps and the activity of members of the pro-integration militias in West Timor. We hope that the Indonesian authorities on site will take steps to right this situation.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa04">At the same time, we also note the unquestioned major successes of UNTAET activities and the consistent manner in which it has been resolving problems. I refer to efforts in such varied fields as the establishment of an East Timorese judicial system, the study of the prospects for providing for the security of East Timor and even the training and equipping of farmers engaged in cultivating coffee beans. Also noteworthy are the positive examples of the training of national personnel in various areas of State and economic activity in East Timor. A source of satisfaction is the policy of the UNTAET leadership on expanding the involvement of the East Timorese themselves in resolving the problems facing the population. That in particular has been reflected in the establishment of a representative National Council and in the involvement of the East Timorese in the leadership of various areas of UNTAET activity. We see a great personal role in these successes by the head of UNTAET, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa05">Everything that I have just said inspires us with the hope that the transition of East Timor to independence will be, while laborious, a successful undertaking.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Fowler</span> <span class="nation">Canada</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">Canada also expresses thanks to the Secretary-General for his report and to Mr. Annabi for his briefing this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">We join other members of the Council in expressing our condolences to the family of Private Manning and to the people of New Zealand for their loss. Until fairly recently Canadian soldiers had the privilege of serving with the New Zealand battalion under their command in what remains one of the more exposed sectors of East Timor. Our soldiers also send their condolences to Private Manning's family and to his colleagues who remain in East Timor. This senseless murder reinforces the need for Indonesia to take immediate action to disarm and stop the activities of the militias in West Timor and improve the security situation in the area as it has repeatedly committed itself to do.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has felt compelled to suspend activities in three of the largest refugee camps in West Timor because of increasing violence and intimidation. The continuing aggression directed at its staff is truly deplorable. Militia leaders must be held to their commitment not to interfere with the safe return of refugees, and we look to the Government of Indonesia to play a constructive role in this regard. The recent violence directed at UNTAET and humanitarian personnel by pro-integrationist militias remains disturbing and suggests that Indonesia must take urgent and more effective steps to control the activities of these militias. Effective action by the Indonesian Government would reinforce the cooperation it has already demonstrated in normalizing relations with East Timor, as evidenced by the establishment of the Joint Border Committee and the memorandum of understanding signed with UNTAET in April on border security.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">Canada is equally concerned about other issues which are dissuading the refugees from returning. For example, it is likely that few refugees will return until issues such as civil service pensions, relocation options and infrastructure deficiencies in East Timor are forthrightly addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">Canada wishes to express its appreciation for UNTAET's efforts to involve the East Timorese fully in the work of administering the territory and for working, through the creation of the National Council, to build capacity for security and self-governance.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">We are pleased to learn of, and enthusiastically support, the Transitional Administration's efforts in the promotion of human rights and democratic development, state-building, gender equality and the establishment of an integrated security sector, and also its efforts to involve the East Timorese themselves -- as I mentioned a moment ago -- in every aspect of the territory's administration. Such efforts are fundamental to the territory's successful entry into the international arena. We are confident that UNTAET, under the able leadership of Special Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello, will guide the territory to independence with wisdom and perseverance, and we look forward to welcoming East Timor into the community of nations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">In closing, allow me to express my Government's deep admiration for the continuing massive and selfless commitment of the Government and forces of Australia to the vital job of maintaining security and helping East Timor to achieve a sustainable peace and effective development in the years to come.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mohammad Kamal</span> <span class="nation">Malaysia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">First and foremost, my delegation would like to thank Assistant Secretary-General Annabi for his briefing this morning and the Secretary-General for his latest lucid and comprehensive report on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), pursuant to <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1272 (1999)</a> of 25 October 1999.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa02">The dynamics of this new, emerging independent nation are positive, although the situation is not without problems. Let me first welcome the historic announcement and swearing-in of East Timor's eight-member transitional Cabinet, four of whom are East Timorese, at UNTAET's headquarters on 15 July. The first meeting of the new Cabinet of the transitional government, on 17 July, is particularly welcomed by my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa03">The holding of that meeting represents a very important step in the right direction towards an independent East Timor. It represents the first time in the territory's history that East Timorese leaders have participated as equal partners in the governing of their own country. Nevertheless, Malaysia recognizes that while a new state structure has emerged in East Timor, reconciliation, tolerance and cooperation will continue to remain the basis for a lasting peace in the future new nation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa04">There have been other positive developments in the last month, which my delegation applauds. These include the decision by the Government of Indonesia to send a 17-member team from the Attorney-General's office to Dili on 20 July to question witnesses and collect any material evidence concerning five criminal cases presented by the Indonesian authorities. The visit was the outcome of the first working-level meeting between UNTAET's legal and political units and its Indonesian counterparts in Jakarta last month.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa05">In addition, we hope that the graduation on 11 July of the first batch of 50 graduates of East Timor's Police Training College in Dili as police officers will enable the territory to fully undertake the responsibility of maintaining law and order.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa06">At the same time, the coming into operation of the East Timor Revenue Service on 1 July is indeed timely. Ninety per cent of the businesses liable for the new impositions have been contracted by UNTAET. We welcome also the decision of UNTAET's land and property unit to start a pilot mapping exercise on 26 July to determine land boundaries in Dili, which hopefully will be the beginning of a systematic registration of land parcels in open areas. Nevertheless we are mindful that the project is not to determine legal ownership or right of occupancy.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa07">Meanwhile, we note with satisfaction the establishment of a Joint Border Committee for the management of all cross-border matters, agreement on which was reached during two days of talks between the Indonesian authorities and UNTAET in Surabaya on 5 July. In this connection, we urge the two parties to continue to explore ways and means to overcome the problem of a land corridor to link East Timor with the isolated Oecussi enclave, on the northern coast of West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa08">We are confident that further progress on other remaining issues -- such as scholarships for East Timorese studying at Indonesian universities, pensions for East Timorese who had worked in the Indonesian administration, Indonesian assets and archives, and the culture of East Timor -- will be achieved at the upcoming September meeting.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa09">My delegation's optimism is tempered, however, by the deterioration of the security situation in some refugee camps in West Timor. We are particularly dismayed at the fact that small groups of thugs are able to carry out with impunity a campaign of intimidation in the camps. We deeply regret that registration of East Timorese refugees in the main refugee camps in Kupang and in the border districts of West Timor has been cancelled as a result of serious security conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa10">Equally, the repeated abuse and threats by the militias against the staff of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are a cause for serious concern to my delegation. Malaysia believes that UNHCR must be allowed to play its part in resolving the refugee problems in West Timor with the full cooperation of the Indonesian authorities.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa11">We are also deeply saddened by the death of a New Zealand peacekeeper, Private William Manning, on 24 July, who was killed in a gun battle with armed militias in East Timor. We extend our deepest and sincerest condolences to the family of Private Manning. This tragic incident serves to remind the international community of the remaining daunting challenges it faces in meeting its commitment to the people of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa12">We welcome the actions taken by Indonesia to date and look forward to further efforts by that country to address this issue.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa13">Although the process of achieving independence and nation-building is currently under way in East Timor under UNTAET, the local population is still living in difficult conditions. Unemployment runs about 80 per cent, and there is little indication that things will improve anytime soon.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa14">Foreign investment, considered vital to reviving the shattered economy, is only trickling in. Apart from a handful of service companies setting up shop in Dili in the hope of profiting from the United Nations short-term presence there, East Timor's private sector barely exists.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa15">Equally disturbing is the fact that land disputes are proving to be one of the greatest stumbling blocks to the economic development needed to sustain East Timor as an independent country.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa16">Without clear ownership laws, and with many Government records destroyed, businesses, quite understandably, are reluctant to invest in long-term projects. While we fully support the proposal of the</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa17">United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to set up an independent tribunal to arbitrate claims, the hundreds of cases that are waiting could take years to be completed. Unless UNTAET is able to resolve the problem quickly, the new nation risks being left without a functioning economy when the Transitional Administration comes to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa18">We recognize that East Timor will need substantial funding from outside the country for the foreseeable future, if it is going to be able to rebuild successfully and to lay the foundations for a society in which the basic needs of all its citizens are met. While donors are prepared to be generous in the short term, they will be justifiably hesitant to commit themselves to assisting East Timor for an indefinite period of time.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa19">In conclusion, my delegation is pleased to hear from Mr. Annabi just now that the leaders of East Timor attended the recent thirty-third annual ministerial meeting of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), in Bangkok. This positive development augurs well for the future relations between independent East Timor and the ASEAN countries -- and, of course, for peace, stability and prosperity in the South-East Asian region.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa20">Finally, my delegation also wishes to pay tribute to the efforts of UNTAET, under the leadership of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. These efforts have contributed to the transformation of East Timor over the past 11 months.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Soderberg</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa01">Let me use this opportunity to praise your leadership, Madam President, and that of your team. As Ambassador Holbrooke told your Foreign Minister just two weeks ago, it has been a very busy and productive month -- and for this we take our hats off to you.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa02">The Council authorized you on Tuesday to express its heartfelt condolences to the family of Private Leonard William Manning, who was killed earlier this week in the service of peace, the international community and the people of East Timor. Private Manning's untimely death reminds us of the risks of peacekeeping and of the courage of the men and women who make up the United Nations forces. I note that New Zealand Permanent Representative Michael Powles is in the Chamber today, and I take this opportunity to convey to his Government and the people of New Zealand our sympathy and our respect. I am sure we all hope that UNTAET, New Zealand and the Government of Indonesia can work together to apprehend and bring to justice Private Manning's killers.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa03">As we heard from Assistant Secretary-General Annabi this morning, the United Nations is doing an important job in East Timor, and UNTAET's great progress is aptly described in the Secretary-General's report. As we heard from Sergio Vieira de Mello last month, UNTAET is increasingly "Timorizing" its administration, working with the East Timorese leadership to develop a timetable to draft a constitution, set elections and declare independence. The Secretary-General's report contains important benchmarks for UNTAET as it moves into the next phase of its work. It underscores that East Timor will require attention and assistance from the international community even after independence. And despite instability in the border area, the situation in the eastern part of East Timor is calm and the United Nations is correctly proceeding with a logical and gradual diminution of UNTAET's troop strength -- which will result in a significant reduction by early next year, without sacrificing overall security.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa04">Despite UNTAET's great progress, problems remain along the border, fuelled by the intolerable situation in West Timor. The Government of Indonesia is abrogating its responsibility to maintain law and order in West Timor, especially in and around the camps. Their failure to do so threatens the work of the United Nations and the impressive progress made to date. The Council for months has expressed concern about the situation in the refugee camps. Yet the situation continues to deteriorate, and UNHCR is threatened by thugs and blocked from doing its vital work.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa05">For months the Council has called on the Government of Indonesia to end cross-border incursions, to disarm and disband the militia and to prosecute those responsible for violence. But the situation does not change. The Indonesian Government and the security forces do not act, and violence and instability continue in West Timor. The death of Private Manning is the tragic result of these failures.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa06">There have been many useful discussions between President Wahid, Xanana Gusmão, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Sergio Vieira de Mello. These discussions are described in detail in the Secretary-General's report. Important agreements have been reached on cooperation, and there have been visits of openness, such as those by West Timor Governor Piet Tallo and Baucau Bishop Basilio Nascimento. Indeed, the sharing of information occurring now between Indonesian and UNTAET human rights investigators demonstrates what can be accomplished with the right intentions. However, what is needed urgently are tangible improvements on the ground, especially in West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa07">Indonesia must do more: it must live up to its written commitments; it must live up to its international agreements; and it must pave the way for a future stable and friendly relationship between two sovereign neighbours: the great, multi-ethnic Republic of Indonesia and the new, fledgling State of Timor Lorosa'e.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa08">I understand that the delegation of the United Kingdom has circulated a draft presidential statement. We support the draft and stand ready to finalize it as soon as possible. We do believe, however, that additional language should be added to more accurately reflect the serious problems experienced by UNHCR in the West Timor camps, in particular the failure of the Government of Indonesia to fulfil its responsibilities to maintain law and order. We will come to the meeting this afternoon with suggestions along those lines.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa09">I would like to end my statement by touching on an entirely separate issue, unrelated to East Timor. The United States Government, as well as other Governments and the Secretary-General, has expressed concern to the Government of Indonesia over the continuing violence in the Moluccas, which has resulted in the death of thousands and a humanitarian crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of Indonesian citizens. Muslims are killing Christians, Christians are killing Muslims. We have heard many alarming reports over the last few months. For instance, just this morning, we heard a report that members of the Laskar Jihad are driving through the city of Ambon, instructing all Christians to evacuate by 31 July or face execution. Similarly, in Poso there are reports of actions by Christians against Muslims. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm these reports since the Government of Indonesia does not allow us access, but given the history of Rwanda and of Srebrenica, the international community must speak out against this violence.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk01-pa10">It is the responsibility of the Government of Indonesia to act to end this crisis. The United States calls on the Government of Indonesia to take steps to restore law and order and basic services to all affected communities, Christian and Muslim alike. The United States further calls on the Government of Indonesia to allow international humanitarian aid workers immediate safe access to the region to provide urgently needed assistance to its people. Jakarta must take action immediately.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the United States for her kind words addressed to me and my delegation.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg013-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Doutriaux</span> <span class="nation">France</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">Allow me, too, to congratulate you, Madam President, regarding this month of July. While I realize that it has not yet ended -- the weekend and Monday remain -- we have already had a very active and productive month, for which the French delegation thanks you. I would also like to thank Mr. Annabi for his very comprehensive report to the Council on the situation in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">Allow me to begin my observations by expressing the great sympathy of the French authorities for the New Zealand Government and authorities and for the people of New Zealand. I would like to ask Ambassador Powles to convey all our sympathy and condolences to the family of the late peacekeeper Private Manning. This tragic event shows clearly that there remain serious security problems in East Timor, problems that we must fully address. In his briefing, Mr. Annabi indicated that an investigation is under way in order to fully determine who was responsible for this tragic assassination. Of course the Security Council would like to learn as soon as possible all that this investigation uncovers and would like to be fully informed about the steps that the Indonesian authorities are taking in this regard.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">Going beyond this tragic event, as the Secretary-General's report clearly shows, there have been some positive developments in East Timor. I would like to comment on the current prospects for its transition to independence. The success of the peacekeeping operation in East Timor rests on the mainly exemplary behaviour of the people and its leadership, who immediately called for the calming of tensions. The relative solidarity within the transitional National Council and the remarkable understanding between Xanana Gusmão and Sergio Vieira de Mello have created a positive synergy with the United Nations, which increasingly has to take administrative decisions. Therefore, the recent establishment of a sort of coalition government composed of Timorese and United Nations representatives is a very positive development. It seems logical that a people who spoke massively 11 months ago in favour of independence should have the will to take their fate into their own hands quite soon.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">As Mr. Vieira de Mello rightly said at the donors' conference in Tokyo, the impact on the country's economy of an international presence of such significance, in terms both of resources and duration, should also be taken into account.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">We feel that the timetable for drawing up a constitution and preparing for elections, which can certainly be forecast to take place towards the end of August 2001, could be shortened to some extent. United Nations assistance could then take the form of traditional development aid. It seems to us that it is in the best interests of East Timor and the United Nations to achieve an exemplary transition towards a normal system of government and the exercise of sovereignty.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">As previous speakers have done, I would like to briefly mention the situation in West Timor. My authorities, like those of previous speakers, are rather tired of having to note that less progress than we would like has been made in the situation in the refugee camps in West Timor. We continue to appeal to the Indonesian authorities. We support the efforts of the United Nations, and of the UNHCR in particular, to find a solution promptly to the problems of the refugee camps in West Timor. If Mr. Annabi could suggest possible action, we would be very grateful.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa07">In conclusion, my delegation will closely examine the draft presidential statement presented by the United Kingdom delegation, with a view to its adoption as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Scheffers</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa01">First of all, I thank Mr. Annabi for his briefing and the Secretary-General for his very comprehensive report.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa02">I realize that many, if not all, issues related to the transitional process in East Timor and the United Nations mission there have already been touched upon. That is why I would like to highlight three aspects only: the security situation, the question of the East Timorese armed forces and the question of independence.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa03">Before doing so, given the mixed picture presented this morning of, on the one hand, good news, and, on the other, frustration and tragedy, my delegation believes it is useful to stress once more how much the Netherlands commends the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) for its untiring efforts in preparing East Timor to become a free, prosperous and independent country.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa04">Unfortunately, the security situation still gives rise for concern. Indeed, the recent incident that caused the death of Private Manning and continuing cross-border attacks demonstrate that it is premature to contend that a situation of stability has been reached. I would like to seize this opportunity to join previous speakers in expressing, on behalf of my Government, our sympathies and condolences to the Government of New Zealand and to the loved ones of Private Manning. We call upon the Indonesian authorities to renew their efforts in cooperating with UNTAET and to disarm and disband the militias operating in the border areas.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa05">Coming back to the security situation in general, I believe that the Council should consider the question of troop reductions very carefully, taking into account all aspects of the situation on the ground. We therefore feel that decisions on the number of troops deployed should be taken only on the basis of sound military advice, preferably by hearing the UNTAET Force Commander who is in an excellent position to enlighten us on this subject. In this context, I echo the wish of, in particular, the representative of Argentina, for further clarification, hoping that the overall security situation will not be compromised by the intended reductions.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa06">Another aspect of the security situation is the question of the future East Timorese armed forces. As my delegation has stated before, their establishment may contribute to strengthening the security in East Timor and thus provide a horizon to the international presence there. We therefore very much welcome the statement made by Mr. Annabi that members of Falintil will be at the core of the future self-defence forces. We take due note of his statement that international assistance is called for. In this respect, my delegation looks forward to the results of the study being conducted by King's College, London.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa07">Prospective independence for East Timor is a matter of great importance. We are all aware of the problems on the way to independence, especially in terms of capacity-building and economic reconstruction. Here the United Nations bears a heavy and grave responsibility. Much as we would like to see East Timor's prospective independence realized, and the current United Nations operation successfully completed, I reiterate that the United Nations should make sure that the process of handing over responsibilities to the East Timorese is carefully calibrated to correspond to the actual emergence of local capacity.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa08">We spoke on earlier occasions in terms of benchmarks, which are referred to, I have noted with pleasure, in paragraph 68 of the Secretary-General's report. We also welcome the establishment of an interim Cabinet and of the newly formed National Council, steps in the right direction.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa09">On the subject of elections, it would seem logical that the election schedule for next year will be elections for a constituent assembly which will debate and adopt the constitution; therefore, it seems that independence should not immediately follow the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg014-bk01-pa10">In conclusion, on a separate and unrelated issue, I very much share the concern expressed by the representative of the United States about the situation in the Moluccas and the alarming reports, so far not confirmed. We call upon the Government of Indonesia to restore law and order and allow humanitarian aid workers to do their work in a terrible situation in the Moluccas.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Ayari</span> <span class="nation">Tunisia</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa01">I wish to begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-738.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/738</a>). My thanks go also to Mr. Hédi Annabi for his introductory remarks.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa02">I join other delegations in offering our condolences to the people of New Zealand and to the family of the peacekeeper who was killed while carrying out his noble task. It is sad to see the international community paying a price in human lives lost in the cause of peace. Criminal acts and attacks on personnel of the United Nations and of humanitarian agencies must be condemned and their perpetrators brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa03">We express our satisfaction at the report of the Secretary-General on developments in the situation in East Timor, which shows that the period of intense crisis is over, and that the focus has shifted to reconstruction and renewal. In our view, this means that progress has been made in the overall situation, but it also makes clear how much remains to be done to consolidate what has been achieved on the path towards peace and reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa04">We are particularly encouraged by progress in the process of normalizing relations between Indonesia and East Timor. The agreements concluded in that respect -- including notably the agreement on border crossing arrangements to make it easier for people to move about and to engage in exchanges, and the establishment of a Joint Border Committee -- are important signs with positive implications, especially for the way in which the refugee issue will be addressed.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa05">At the same time, we are concerned by the difficult refugee situation; according to the report of the Secretary-General, between 85,000 and 120,000 refugees remain in camps. We call upon the parties to help the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) carry out its vital mission.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa06">Two days ago, the Council discussed the issue of children and armed conflict. Everything said in that debate holds true for the children of East Timor. The fate of those children is of great concern; we must help them, as a matter of primary importance.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa07">We share the view stated by the Secretary-General in his report, that the achievement of the important mission entrusted to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) will depend to a degree on the relationship between UNTAET and the Timorese. In that connection, we hail the consultations undertaken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General with the Timorese and the excellent coordination between the Transitional Administration on the one hand and the Government of Indonesia and the agencies in the field on the other.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk01-pa08">Finally, we consider that economic factors and the promotion of the economy must be among our highest priorities; the international community, donor countries and financial institutions should therefore help East Timor to consolidate its achievements and to address the humanitarian and economic needs of the post-conflict period.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Krokhmal</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa01">I join previous speakers in thanking the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the situation in East Timor and on the activities of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). Our thanks go also to Mr. Hédi Annabi for his introduction of the report and for his comments this morning.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa02">It was with deep sadness that we learned that on 24 July an UNTAET patrol investigating a cross-border incursion in the Cova Lima district was attacked with automatic fire and that a New Zealand citizen, Private Leonard William Manning, was killed in that incident. We express our profound condolences to the family and to the Government of New Zealand. We strongly urge the Indonesian authorities and UNTAET officials to investigate the incident thoroughly and to bring to justice all those responsible for this crime without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa03">Although I agree with the evaluation of many previous speakers, that UNTAET has managed to halt political violence and that the security situation in East Timor is generally stable, I note that there are still challenges before us. More than once, it has been pointed out in this Chamber that the Council should be given an opportunity to consider the whole military and security situation in East Timor and to receive a specific briefing on that issue. We believe it is essential that the Council receive the most detailed and accurate information on the security situation on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa04">The security situation is of obvious relevance to the return of refugees. Mr. Annabi mentioned that the registration of refugees has been indefinitely postponed owing to attacks on workers attached to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) by militia members earlier this month. We condemn those attacks, and we believe that the UNHCR should be given all the support it needs to attain its objectives.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa05">We strongly support the role of UNTAES in guiding East Timor through its transition to independence. The establishment on 14 July of the National Council and the reorganization of UNTAET to include direct participation by East Timorese were of vital importance. The "Timorization" of the Transitional Administration is of fundamental interest to the local communities at this stage, and is conducive to long-term success in terms of independence for East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa06">We are pleased to see that more and more East Timorese people are involved in the reconstruction process. We were encouraged to hear from Mr. Annabi that a number of projects to provide employment for them are being successfully carried out by the UNTAET trust fund and by United Nations agencies.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa07">We could continue to highlight significant advances in the difficult task of promoting reconciliation and reconstruction in East Timor. At the same time, it is clear to us that there are still serious and difficult obstacles. It falls to the Security Council and to the entire international community to continue to play an active and leading role in implementing what was agreed upon in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1272(1999).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1272 (1999)</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg015-bk02-pa08">In conclusion, we pay tribute to UNTAET and to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, for their efforts.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg016-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Keita</span> <span class="nation">Mali</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa01">I thank you, Madam President, for convening this briefing on East Timor. My thanks go also to Mr. Hédi Annabi for his detailed introduction of the report of the Secretary-General. At the same time, I convey the condolences of the delegation of Mali to the family of the New Zealand peacekeeper who was killed, as well as to the people of New Zealand and to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). We hope that the investigation of this criminal act will be successful and that the perpetrators will be brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa02">My delegation wishes yet again to commend UNTAET for its administration work in East Timor. That work has been marked by constant progress, as described in the 26 July report of the Secretary-General (<a href="../pdf/S-2000-738.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/738</a>). But a number of matters continue to give rise to concern, and we have a few brief comments to make in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa03">My delegation welcomed the creation on 14 July of the National Council to replace the National Consultative Council. Thanks to its broader base, it will allow greater participation by the Timorese in the political process. The setting up a few days ago of a Cabinet with Timorese members will ensure improved decision-making.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa04">During our consideration of the question of East Timor last month, we appealed to UNTAET to ensure that the participation of the Timorese people in the political process would come about quickly, and in a calm and transparent manner. We are therefore concerned to see an increase in political intolerance in the form of harassment and intimidation. We renew that appeal, while supporting the steps taken by UNTAET to bring about the rule of law and expressing our satisfaction at the continuing normalization of relations with Indonesia. The creation of a Joint Border Committee with responsibility for managing all cross-border matters will give a new impetus to the search for solutions to important issues such as the return of refugees and the payment of pensions.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa05">We are pleased by the quality of the humanitarian assistance mentioned in the Secretary-General's report. However, the number of refugees still in West Timor is considerable. We appeal to the Indonesian authorities to act with greater rigour to halt the actions of the militias. Militia attacks against humanitarian workers and associated personnel cannot be tolerated.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa06">Turning to economics, I regard the Tokyo and Lisbon conferences as important milestones in reviving the economic sector in East Timor. We therefore urge donor countries to continue to provide assistance to UNTAET, working together with the financial institutions and various specialized United Nations agencies, as it carries out integrated development projects. The support of the private sector and the promotion of investment should be a priority objective with a view to bringing about a considerable reduction in unemployment. In this regard, my delegation would like to thank the Japanese, Australian and American cooperation agencies and all the countries that have contributed to the Trust Fund for their considerable support for the reconstruction of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg016-bk01-pa07">In conclusion, I urge the international community to continue to support UNTAET so that the progress achieved over the past nine months can be sustained.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg017-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa01"> I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Jamaica.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa02">I wish to join previous speakers in expressing my delegation's appreciation to Mr. Hedi Annabi for his introductory remarks and to the Secretary-General for his report, which provides an excellent overview of the present situation in East Timor, covering political developments, the status of refugees, governance, public administration, security and humanitarian affairs, as well as relations between East Timor and Indonesia.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa03">When the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and head of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, briefed the Council last month, my delegation paid tribute to him and to the men and women of UNTAET for their dedicated and dynamic service, which had seen the transformation of East Timor since the start of the mission.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa04">We noted the positive developments, which included the increasing involvement of the East Timorese in creating and building institutions of governance, the cooperation which had developed between UNTAET and the Government of Indonesia, and the commitments received from the international community in support of East Timor's reconstruction and rehabilitation process. We welcome the further developments described in the report of the Secretary-General, including the formation of the interim Cabinet and the graduation of the first batch of East Timorese police. At the same time, we expressed our deep concern about the status of refugees and the attacks on staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and on United Nations peacekeepers by suspected militias.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa05">It is therefore with deep regret that my delegation must express its sincere condolences to the Government and people of New Zealand and to the family of Private Leonard William Manning, who was killed on 24 July while on duty in East Timor. The perpetrators must speedily be brought to justice.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa06">The death of the young peacekeeper, as well as the continued attacks on UNHCR staff, which have forced the closure of the UNHCR office in the border town of Betun and the withdrawal of its international staff there, highlight the continued security problems on the border between East and West Timor, occasioned by the operation of armed militia groups. The Indonesian authorities must act quickly and firmly in cooperation with UNTAET to deal with these incidents, which clearly endanger the security presence, as well as the lives of the 85,000 refugees who remain in camps in West Timor. Moreover, UNHCR must have free and unhindered access to these camps to enable refugee registration in order to determine those who wish to be resettled or returned to East Timor. The prospect of a possible withdrawal of UNHCR would have devastating effects on this process.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa07">The reported harassment and intimidation of religious and ethnic minorities is also disturbing. There are reports of the intimidation of groups and parties outside the National Council of Timorese Resistance. We believe that the inclusion of all groups and parties is fundamental to the process of democracy in East Timor. The gains which have been made so far must be consolidated, and not destroyed. Tolerance of various groups on different sides of the political, religious and ethnic divide must be one of the foundations for an independent East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa08">UNTAET's role in promoting peaceful coexistence and stability is evidenced in the recently launched programme on the future of democracy in East Timor. We welcome this programme, and would like to hear more about its achievements and strategies in future briefings. My delegation strongly supports this venture, as we believe it can promote a culture of tolerance and peace.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa09">My delegation also wishes to acknowledge the role of UNTAET, in collaboration with the humanitarian agencies, in ensuring country-wide provision of humanitarian assistance. This is demonstrated in the establishment of a coordination centre to support the work of non-governmental organizations. The development of the capacity of local development organizations is an important facet of this centre's work. In addition, the handing over of the centre to the East Timorese is very positive, as we believe that local groups and organizations are at the core of local community development initiatives and that in the long run this will contribute to sustainability.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa10">The Secretary-General's report notes that there has been some improvement in the economic situation, particularly the moderate expansion of business activity and the strong recovery in the agricultural sector due to the good coffee crop and domestic demand. The projects being implemented by the United States Agency for International Development, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency and the Australian Agency for International Development, as well as those funded by the United Nations Trust Fund, have made a significant contribution to creating jobs and improving the overall unemployment situation. We recognize, however, that these programmes will come to an end, leading to a possible reduction in employment. This could have negative effects on the situation in East Timor, where the unemployment rate still far exceeds 50 per cent. It is therefore vital for an enabling environment to be created to encourage private sector investment.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa11">Jamaica fully recognizes the daunting tasks which remain. The process under way in East Timor has to be examined from a long-term perspective, each development being seen as an incremental step forward in the creation of an independent territory.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa12">My delegation supports the benchmarks set out by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative as a means of providing the East Timorese with a sound basis for independence. These include arrangements for the security of an independent East Timor; the establishment of a credible system of justice, an efficient system of law and order and an effective public service; and the eventual adoption of a constitution and the holding of democratic elections. UNTAET has, in less than one year, demonstrated measurable successes in difficult circumstances, and we again salute the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the men and women of UNTAET and the people of East Timor, and assure them of our continued solidarity and support.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa13">I now resume my function as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk01-pa14">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of New Zealand. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Powles</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa01">I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this meeting. I am instructed by my Government to speak today because of its concern over the situation which led to the killing on Monday this week of a New Zealand soldier deployed as a United Nations peacekeeper in East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa02">As the Council is aware from an earlier briefing by the Secretariat, Private Manning was a member of a small reconnaissance patrol sent to follow up reports by local East Timorese of a militia presence near the border with West Timor. At 10.30 a.m. East Timor time on 24 July, the patrol was engaged by a group of suspected militia lying in wait in well-defended positions, and during the action, Private Manning was killed. When his body was recovered some hours later, it was found to have been mutilated.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa03">The death of a United Nations peacekeeper on active service is an all too common event. I think of the casualties suffered by troop-contributors to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) only recently. What singles out Private Manning's death, perhaps, is the circumstances surrounding it. Only last month in this Chamber, we spoke of our concern at recent militia incursions and attacks on United Nations peacekeepers, including the wounding of an Australian peacekeeper. While acknowledging the positive actions taken by Indonesia up to that point, we called in June for renewed efforts by the Indonesian Government to rein in the militias in West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa04">My Government is grateful for the messages of sympathy from the Security Council expressed in the statement to the press by you, Madam President, on behalf of the Council, on Tuesday. It has been passed on to Private Manning's family. The condolence messages this morning, including from Assistant Secretary-General Annabi on behalf of the Secretary-General, are also very much appreciated and similarly will be passed to Private Manning's family. Now we demand that those responsible for his death be brought to justice. We welcome the undertakings given to this effect by the Indonesian Government and trust that there will be the fullest cooperation among the parties concerned to achieve this outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa05">The dangerous security environment along East Timor's border with Indonesia has been allowed to persist for far too long. We again urge the Indonesian Government to redouble its efforts to put an end to all militia activity in West Timor. This will require effective action to disarm and disband the militia groups. These extremists must be dealt with firmly.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa06">Furthermore, the continued large-scale presence of refugees in West Timor provides cover for the militias' existence and activities. We are deeply concerned that repatriation of refugees to East Timor has virtually halted. They continue to face threats and intimidation. The Indonesian authorities must take effective steps to remove obstacles to the repatriation or resettlement of the refugees in accordance with their wishes. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees must be given unimpeded access to these people, and they and other humanitarian workers must be given adequate protection. It is essential that law and order and security in and around the refugee camps be established as soon as possible. This is clearly the responsibility of the Indonesian Government and its armed forces and police.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk01-pa07">New Zealand condemns those who threaten East Timor's stability and the United Nations-sponsored process of peace and reconciliation for which Private Manning made the ultimate sacrifice. The Secretary-General's valuable report makes clear the substantial progress achieved by UNTAET over the past six months in the face of enormous challenges. The increased direct participation of East Timorese people in the governance of the territory of the period under review is especially welcomed. But there must be no further violence against those who have been deployed in East Timor from so many nations around the world in the service of peace and under the mandate of this Council.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Portugal. I invite her to take a seat at the Council table and to make her statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Paiva</span> <span class="nation">Portugal</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa01">At the outset, allow me to thank the Secretary-General for his excellent report on the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and Assistant Secretary-General Annabi for his comprehensive briefing.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa02">We welcome the measures that were taken with regard to reinforcing the capacity-building of the East Timorese, namely through their participation in the transitional Government. We also welcome and commend the efforts carried out by the UNTAET through the able leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, regarding the rehabilitation of the infrastructures and the setting up of mechanisms and systems in the fields of education, health and judicial administration.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa03">Despite all the efforts that were made by UNTAET to find a solution to the refugee problem and to secure the border, we must recognize that the dialogue with Indonesian authorities has not yet produced the expected results. It is with deep regret that I express the serious concern of the Portuguese Government over the killing of a New Zealand peacekeeper by elements that had crossed the border from West Timor to East Timor. Portugal deeply regrets the situation and has already conveyed through appropriate channels its condolences and solidarity to the Government of New Zealand and the family of Private Leonard William Manning.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa04">These regrettable events overshadow the East Timorese transition process towards independence. Despite all efforts and public pronouncements of the Indonesian Government, there still prevails a lack of control over the activities carried out by some militia elements along the border. Therefore, Portugal would like to call on the Indonesian authorities, in particular its military forces, to cooperate more closely with UNTAET to completely disarm and disband the militias in order to end cross-border incursions from West Timor and to bring to justice those militia members responsible for crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa05">Portugal regrets the difficulties experienced in, and the slow pace of, the return of East Timorese refugees remaining in West Timor. We also wish to express our great concern at the continued militia presence in the refugee camps and their intimidation of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk02-pa06">The Portuguese authorities welcomed the attention of the Security Council to the East Timorese transition towards independence and hopes it will continue to keep the issue under close consideration. Portugal remains firmly committed to work together with Indonesia and the United Nations for the implementation of the New York agreements.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg020-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Stuart</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa01">I commend your decision to open this meeting to participation by non-members of the Council at short notice. Developments in recent days have again highlighted the continuing challenges faced by the people of East Timor and by the international community in the transition process. These challenges deserve the focus and concern of all United Nations Member States and warrant opening up the Council to broader participation.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa02">The Australian Government was deeply saddened by the death of the New Zealand peacekeeper on 24 July at the hands of suspected militia members, near the East Timor border with West Timor. We call on the Indonesian Government to help bring to justice those responsible for Private Manning's death.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa03">We condemn the violent behaviour of those who continue to seek to destabilize the process of peace and reconciliation in East Timor. This tragic event serves to remind the international community of the remaining challenges it faces in meeting its commitment to the people of East Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa04">Australia calls upon all parties to stiffen their resolve to stamp out militia activity on both sides of the border.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa05">We are conscious of the efforts already made at the most senior levels of the Indonesian Government to deal with this problem, but ultimately only that Government can take the steps which are needed to prevent such incidents.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa06">We urge Indonesia to redouble its efforts to bring militia activity in West Timor to an end, including by bringing to justice those militia members who have committed crimes.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa07">Another issue of serious concern to the Australian Government is the situation in the refugee camps in West Timor. Ongoing militia activity in and around the camps continues to affect the refugees, who are the most vulnerable members of East Timorese society. Until these people feel safe enough to return to East Timor or to make other free choices about their future, the process of reconciliation will remain fragile.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa08">We again urge the Indonesian authorities to take all the necessary measures to bring an end to militia activity in West Timor by disarming and disbanding the militia, removing them from the refugee camps, and enhancing cooperation with the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to ensure an end to cross-border militia incursions.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk02-pa09">We also call on the Government of Indonesia to do everything possible to accelerate the resettlement and repatriation of refugees, including separating militias from refugees, ensuring that international agencies have unimpeded access to refugees to determine their preferences and to supervise repatriation; to work with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to respond to its serious concerns about its capacity to continue to carry out its responsibilities in West Timor; and, together with the international community, to plan for the permanent resettlement of those who do not wish to return.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kobayashi</span> <span class="nation">Japan</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa01">Madam President, I would like to thank you for providing us with this opportunity to present Japan's views on the situation in East Timor in the light of the recent events, particularly the tragic death of Private Leonard William Manning on 24 July. The Government and people of Japan extend their profound condolences to the family of Private Manning, who gave his life while serving the cause of peace, and also express their sincere sympathy to the Government and people of New Zealand.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa02">Japan's views on the situation in East Timor, as presented in the open meeting last month, remain unchanged. Today I would like to focus my comments on recent developments and issues which were not elaborated on in our previous statement.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa03">First of all, Japan is gravely concerned at the recent resurgence of militia activities in the border areas of East Timor. As we have repeatedly stressed, the maintenance of security is a prerequisite for successful nation-building, and every effort should be made to this end. We recognize that the measures taken by the Indonesian Government have resulted in a decrease in incidents caused by the militias in the border areas since April, but recent events have shown that these efforts need to be continued and furthered.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa04">Such efforts should be twofold. First, the border areas must be secured to prevent cross-border incursions. In this respect, we call on the military forces of Indonesia and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to cooperate more closely in order to fully implement the Memorandum of Understanding on tactical coordination signed on 11 April. Secondly, the root cause of the problem must be addressed by disarming and disbanding the militias in West Timor. Difficult and complex as this task may be, only the Government of Indonesia is in a position to take effective measures to this end, and we call on it to make further efforts in this respect.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa05">The fate of the remaining East Timorese refugees in West Timor is also a matter of concern to Japan. Efforts by the Indonesian authorities and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have enabled more than 167,000 refugees to return, but the Secretary-General has estimated that 85,000 to 120,000 refugees still remain in West Timor. The lack of tangible progress on this issue in recent months makes it clear that greater efforts are required by the parties concerned. We are also reminded of the fact that UNHCR's resources are not limitless. Nevertheless Japan believes that international support is essential in resolving this difficult problem, and it supports the involvement and efforts of UNHCR. We call upon the Indonesian authorities to make further efforts in collaborating with UNHCR, which is the only effective formula for resolving this refugee problem.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk04-pa06">The recent tragic incident and the lack of progress in certain aspects of the situation underscore the need for continued and determined efforts on the part of all the relevant parties and players. In this respect, I would like to reiterate once again Japan's commitment to cooperate to the best of its ability with UNTAET and the people of East Timor in their efforts to build a peaceful and democratic nation.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01"> The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his statement.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wibisono</span> <span class="nation">Indonesia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">My delegation has noted the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General contained in <a href="../pdf/S-2000-738.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2000/738</a>. Having participated in the meeting of the Council on 27 June 2000 concerning the situation in East Timor, we will confine our intervention to the developments that have taken place over the last month.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">As affirmed in that report, the Government of Indonesia has established a satisfactory level of cooperation with the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) since the inception of its mandate by the Security Council. Significant developments reflective of Indonesia's sincere cooperation and support for the development of East Timor have included, among others, the visit of President Abdurrahman Wahid to Dili on 29 February 2000 and the signing of a joint communiqué on issues that need to be resolved in order to establish friendly and mutually beneficial relations between Indonesia and East Timor. The two sides are committed to taking measures that include the promotion of trade and communication; the provision of legal cooperation; the establishment of representative offices in Jakarta, Dili and Kupang; and the continued access by East Timorese to Indonesian educational institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa03">As a result of intensive discussions that took place in Jakarta on legal matters on 6 April 2000, the Government of Indonesia and UNTAET concluded a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in legal, judicial and human rights matters. In the context of implementing the understanding, the Indonesian authorities have continued to extend every form of assistance to bringing the perpetrators of alleged human rights violations to justice. In this regard, a team from the Indonesian Attorney-General's Office arrived in Dili on 19 July for a 10-day mission, the purpose of which is to collect evidence and testimony in connection with the five priority criminal cases to be presented by Indonesia. During this visit the Indonesian team met with officials from the UNTAET Serious Crimes Unit, the Political Office and the Human Rights Office.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa04">As is acknowledged in paragraph 52 of the report, the security situation has been "generally stable". In line with the Memorandum of Understanding regarding tactical coordination in the border area to enhance cooperation, signed between the Commander of East Nusa Tengarra and UNTAET's Force Commander on 11 April 2000, the Indonesian Armed Forces, in fulfilling their responsibility for security on their side of the border, deployed additional battalions on the border to assure security and stability. These renewed efforts have resulted in an even quieter situation.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa05">Indonesia's cooperation is further evidenced by the number of agreements reached with UNTAET during three rounds of negotiations. Following the third round of negotiations in Surabaya early this month, the two sides agreed <i>inter alia</i> to establish a joint border committee, which will be entrusted with the task of establishing a border regime, including the demarcation of the borders between East Nusa Tenggara and East Timor, and the delineation of the maritime boundary between Indonesia and East Timor. This committee, to be comprised of officials from the Indonesian Government and representatives of UNTAET, is expected to work in the near future to initially establish a regime for cross-border traffic and visits of Indonesians and East Timorese. In addition, the Government of Indonesia and UNTAET are currently working on arrangements regarding transit between the Oecussi enclave and the rest of East Timor. The question of pensions of former East Timorese employees living in East Timor is also being addressed by the two sides.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa06">My delegation deems it pertinent to reiterate that there are no easy solutions to the multifaceted problem of the refugees in East Nusa Tenggara. From the outset, the Indonesian Government has spared no effort in extending its cooperation to UNTAET, the UNHCR and other relevant international humanitarian organizations to expedite the repatriation of refugees. Over the past few months 167,000 refugees have been reintegrated into East Timorese society. Paragraph 13 of the report depicts this process as "generally smooth".</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa07">Despite these endeavours, the repatriation of the remaining refugees in East Nusa Tenggara would be greatly facilitated by adequate guarantees being given to them concerning basic necessities, including food, shelter and security in East Timor. A successful resolution of this problem requires the much needed assistance of the international community. At the same time, the responsibility for the refugees is a collective one, and hence the United Nations has an important role to play in addressing the refugees' concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa08">My delegation regrets the decision of UNHCR to temporarily close its office in Betun, due to security concerns, while conducting the registration exercise of refugees. We have noted, however, that the UNHCR will continue to carry out its activities from Atambua. To address these concerns, as well as to expedite the repatriation of refugees, a meeting of various East Timorese factions, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the United Nations Force Commander and the Commander of Udayana Military Command was held in Denpasar, Bali, on 26-27 July. We are hopeful that this meeting will lead to a productive outcome. During this meeting the concerned parties expressed their initial agreement on expediting the return of the refugees and hoped that this plan could be implemented in the near future.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa09">In this connection, while we underscore the imperative need to promote reconciliation among the East Timorese of all political persuasions, my delegation is pleased to inform the Council that such an undertaking recently began, on the margins of the said Bali meeting. We believe that this constitutes an encouraging development in the context of establishing a solid foundation upon which a harmonious East Timorese society can be built.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa10">It has been the consistent policy of Indonesia to strongly condemn all acts of violence, including the tragic incident that took place in Suai, East Timor, on 24 July. The killing of a United Nations peacekeeper from New Zealand is deeply deplorable to my delegation. On this solemn occasion my delegation joins other speakers in extending our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family in this hour of sorrow. In spite of the untiring efforts of the Indonesian Government to provide security, it is impossible under such uncertain and tenuous circumstances to control the actions of each and every individual in the refugee camps. The incident occurred after strenuous efforts had been made by the Government of Indonesia to prevent such acts of violence from occurring. Such acts have been depicted by UNTAET as isolated incidents.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa11">The Indonesian Government has, however, swiftly responded to this tragic incident by extending its full cooperation to the ongoing investigation. Its exemplary cooperation is reflected by Indonesia's invitation to the Government of New Zealand to jointly investigate this incident involving its national. Even though this is the first combat-related death of a United Nations peacekeeper in East Timor, my delegation earnestly believes that this loss of life is one too many and hence warrants our urgent attention.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa12">It may be recalled that, in order to avoid the occurrence of unfortunate incidents, the Indonesian authorities earlier proposed to UNTAET that there was a need to maintain joint patrols and joint border posts and to exchange military liaison officers. But, unfortunately, these proposals were rejected by UNTAET on the basis that the parties concerned had to be responsible for providing security on their respective sides of the border.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa13">Finally, as the Secretary-General states, the best assurance for a secure future for East Timor</p>
	<blockquote id="pg021-bk02-pa14">"lies in healthy relations with the countries in the region, particularly Indonesia, its closest neighbour". (<i><a href="../pdf/S-2000-738.pdf" class="pdf">S/2000/738</a>, para. 67</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa15">Indeed, the attainment of this noble objective will facilitate the inauguration of a new era of amity and friendship, to the mutual benefit of the two peoples. Towards this end, Indonesia will continue to extend its cooperation and support. We would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and other concerned parties for their efforts in bringing this complex and challenging task to a successful conclusion.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to Mr. Annabi to respond to the comments made and the questions raised.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Annabi</span> <span class="non-nation">Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">Since it is late, I will try to be brief. There were essentially two questions, one on the situation of the Falintil and what could be done to improve it, and one on what might be done regarding the refugees in West Timor.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">As regards the Falintil, some members are serving as security officers in UNTAET; some others are serving in liaison functions, liaising between UNTAET and the local population. They were, of course, given the option of applying for participation in the new East Timorese police force, but chose not to do so for reasons that are well understood. A significant number have gone on leave, some on extended leave, returning to their homes and families. As a result of all this, the number of Falintil in the cantonment in Aileu has fallen from over a thousand people to under 500. UNTAET has been considering various options for the reintegration into civilian life of those members of Falintil who will not join the proposed defence or security force, either because they do not wish to do so or because they would not qualify. We feel that the recommendations to be prepared by the ongoing King's College study on the possible establishment of a security or defence force in East Timor will enable UNTAET to move forward on some of these options. In the meantime, of course, those Falintil members who are still in the cantonment in Aileu have received food supplies, and efforts have been made to improve their accommodation and their general living conditions, in addition to the grant that was provided from the consolidated East Timor budget, as I mentioned in my statement.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">As regards what can be done to improve the situation of the refugees in West Timor and what measures may be taken, I think they are quite well known; some have been mentioned by members of the Council. To summarize, what is required is unhindered access to the refugees; guarantees for the security of the refugees and the humanitarian workers; separation from the refugees of former soldiers, police officers and civil servants; and the conduct of a credible registration exercise which would enable UNHCR to confirm the exact numbers of those present in the camps, as well as to ascertain their wishes. A commitment on the part of the Government of Indonesia to pay pensions to former civil servants, including beyond independence, would also help to remove an obstacle to return of the refugees. Finally, of course, the Government of Indonesia should be encouraged, as I mentioned in my statement, to ensure that the activities of the militias in the camps are brought to an end.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">The Council may wish to address these issues in the proposed presidential statement that it will be considering in the coming days, but Council members may also wish individually to engage the Government of Indonesia to see how these steps could be taken and what could be done to ensure that they materialize.</p>
