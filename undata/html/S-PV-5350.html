<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them <a href="../pdf/S-2006-2.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2006/2</a>, which contains the seventh progress report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council strongly condemns the recent violent attacks against the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) and international NGO facilities in Côte d'Ivoire by street militias and other groups associated with the 'Young Patriots', as well as their instigators. The Security Council expresses its deep concern also at the violent and orchestrated street protests led by the 'Young Patriots', in particular in Abidjan and in several cities in the west.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council regards these particularly serious and unacceptable incidents as endangering the process of national reconciliation enshrined in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1633(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1633 (2005)</a> and as contrary to this resolution. It calls upon all Ivorians to refrain from any hostile action, and demands the immediate end of this violence and of all hatred messages in the media, in particular the attacks against the United Nations. The Security Council welcomes the urgent mission led by President Obasanjo in Abidjan. It pays tribute to his efforts and hopes that they will lead to a rapid decrease of the current tensions on the ground.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council underlines also that the occupation of the RTI facilities constitutes an attack against freedom and neutrality of information as well as a breach of the principles of the process of national reconciliation, of the previous resolutions of the Security Council and of the peace agreements. It demands that effective control by the board and the General Director over the RTI shall be re-established immediately.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the Prime Minister, Mr. Charles Konan Banny, and invites UNOCI, in accordance with its mandate, to provide him all the necessary support. It reiterates also its full support for the International Working Group (IWG), the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the High Representative for the elections. It endorses the final communiqué of the IWG of 15 January 2006.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council firmly calls upon all the Ivorian parties to cooperate with the Prime Minister, the International Working Group, the Mediation Group, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the High Representative for the elections in implementing the road map.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"It underlines that targeted measures will be imposed against persons to be designated by the Committee established by paragraph 14 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1572 (2004)</a> who, among other things, block the implementation of the peace process, including by attacking or obstructing the action of UNOCI, of the French forces, of the High Representative for the elections or of the International Working Group, or who incite publicly hatred and violence, as provided in <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1572(2004).pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 1572 (2004)</a> and <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1643(2005).pdf" class="pdf">1643 (2005)</a>."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2006-2.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2006/2</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
