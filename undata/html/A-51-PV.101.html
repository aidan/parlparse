	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa01">It is my sad duty to inform members of the passing of one of our colleagues, His Excellency Mr. Benny Kimberg, the Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations since 1995.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">Ambassador Kimberg had a long and distinguished career as a diplomat who was well respected both at home and abroad for his admirable qualities and devotion to his country and to the ideals of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa03">On behalf of the General Assembly, and on my own behalf, I should like to convey our heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of Denmark and to the bereaved family.</p>

	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa01">In my capacity as Chairman of the Group of African States, I would, on behalf of the African Group, like to pay tribute to the memory of the late Benny Kimberg, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations, who sadly passed away on 8 June 1997.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa02">We will all remember Ambassador Kimberg for many years to come, not simply because he was one of us, but more so for what he personified, both as a man and as a diplomat. He was an astute diplomat and consummate negotiator, showing keen interest characterized by boundless enthusiasm and energy in dealing with issues of global concern. His sterling leadership qualities were quite apparent in his role as Chairman of the Humanitarian Liaison Working Group and in his participation in many other international forums.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa03">The late Ambassador Kimberg's long and meritorious service to his country in the field of diplomacy earned him the admiration, love and respect of friends and colleagues. In many ways, he epitomized the indefatigable spirit and sincere commitment of the international community to the pursuit and attainment of international peace, security and development, as well as the universal promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa04">The passing away of Ambassador Kimberg has robbed Denmark and the international community of the services and presence of an outstanding diplomat. It behooves me therefore to extend, on behalf of the African Group, our heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of Denmark and members of the bereaved family. We share their profound grief and deep sense of loss.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk06-pa05">As we mourn the passing away of our dear friend and colleague, let us, in dedication to his cherished memory, keep alive his share of our collective commitment to the realization of the objectives and mandates for which the United Nations was founded. May his soul rest in perfect and everlasting peace.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the States members of the Asian Group, I wish to express our deepest regret and sorrow at the untimely passing away of Ambassador Benny Kimberg, Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations. The late Ambassador Kimberg had an impressive record of service to his country, serving in varying capacities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and abroad. His service to his Government extended a little over 33 years. He was a sincere and dedicated man, committed to his duty and service to his country, his people and his fellow men, serving as Ambassador of his country to the United Nations. His loss is indeed a loss to his country and to his people. We will remember him as a friend and as a colleague.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk02-pa02">At this moment of sadness we offer our condolences to the Government and the people of Denmark, to his family members and relatives, to his close friends and to the staff of the Mission of Denmark, which he led as Permanent Representative. We offer our prayers to the Almighty to comfort the bereaved, and we beseech the good Lord to console the soul of the late Benny Kimberg.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa01">On behalf of the States members of the Eastern European Group, I would like to express our most sincere condolences to the people and the Government of Denmark in connection with the untimely death of Ambassador Benny Kimberg, Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations. Many if not all of us knew and respected Ambassador Kimberg for his professionalism and good-natured character. He displayed an active interest in the activities of this world Organization and worked for its benefit and for the benefit of his own nation until the last moment of his life.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa02">He will be remembered by the United Nations diplomatic community for his tireless efforts aimed at promoting the high purposes and values of our Organization. It was a great privilege to have known and worked with Ambassador Kimberg. His loss will be felt by many for a long time to come.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk04-pa03">We also convey our deepest sympathy to the relatives of the deceased. May he rest in peace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Leonce</span> <span class="nation">Saint Lucia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa01">I have the sad duty on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group of expressing deepest condolences to the family and friends of the late Ambassador Benny Kimberg, and to the Government and the people of Denmark.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa02">While we mourn his death, we cannot but stop a moment to celebrate his accomplishments. Ambassador Kimberg was a diplomat par excellence. His experience was varied. He served in Europe, Asia and North America. His performance was excellent, and his steady rise, from officer in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to First Secretary at his Mission in New York, all the way to Permanent Representative, is testimony to that fact. His contribution to his people and his country, and to the international community, was outstanding. The confidence vested in him by his Government and by the international community through the responsibilities delegated to him is strong evidence of that fact.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa03">He accomplished all of this in a great hurry, with a sense of purpose, before retirement age. He took his mission on Earth seriously, and executed it thoroughly and with distinction. And while he rests from the exhaustion of his terrestrial sojourn, he has left behind a new standard of excellence in international affairs for all living diplomats to emulate. May we who are left behind to finish the work he began and who still have time on our side approach our missions with the same commitment, reliability and efficiency that Ambassador Kimberg upheld, so that while he rests we may continue to live out the attributes he lived for.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk06-pa04">May we be comforted by our fond memories of his sterling contribution, and may his soul rest in peace.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Campbell</span> <span class="nation">Ireland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the Group of Western European and Other States, I wish to offer profound condolences on the tragic death of Benny Kimberg, Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">Benny Kimberg took up his appointment at the United Nations in the summer of 1995. Before that he had had a distinguished career in the Danish Foreign Ministry, serving at the United Nations in New York, in Moscow and Washington, and as Under-Secretary for Political Affairs in Copenhagen, before becoming Ambassador in Tokyo and Paris.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">I first worked with Benny in the mid-1970s, in the early days of European political cooperation. Subsequently we met again in Paris where we were both Ambassadors to France. All who knew Benny cherished his friendship and his deep insight into international affairs. He was a warm and approachable colleague, whose advice and observations were given with generosity and humour, even extending to the particular affection he had for his dog, his beloved companion, who accompanied him from Paris to New York.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">A convinced European, he set the European ideal squarely in a framework of international cooperation. His knowledge of the United Nations was extensive and his determination to advance the aims of the Organization in many practical ways was evident to all who knew him. He had only recently assumed the chairmanship of the Humanitarian Liaison Working Group, to whose activity he promised to bring all the experience and commitment associated with his country's role in humanitarian affairs.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">Benny Kimberg had only a comparatively short time in the knowledge of his fatal illness. He was determined to fight that illness to the end. As it happened, he lost that fight. But we who remember Benny will always treasure the memory of his friendship. He spoke directly and honestly of the things he loved in his work and life, and he gave richly to both.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">To his family and relatives, to the Danish Government, which has lost a distinguished public servant and a lover of Denmark, and to all the staff of the Permanent Mission of Denmark, who held him in special affection, we extend our very sincere sympathy.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Gnehm</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa01">It was with great sadness that my delegation and my Government learned of the death of the Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations, Ambassador Benny Kimberg, on 8 June. On behalf of the host country to the United Nations, I would like to express our deepest condolences to the family of Ambassador Kimberg, to our colleagues at the Permanent Mission of Denmark to the United Nations, and to the Foreign Ministry, the Government and the people of Denmark.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa02">Ambassador Kimberg was not only a valued colleague here in New York and a good friend to many of us -- to all of us -- here at the United Nations, but also one of his country's most distinguished diplomats. His service included senior postings at the Danish Foreign Ministry, in Moscow, as well as in Tokyo and Paris, as some of his friends have already said. He was a familiar and welcome presence in the United States, having served both in Washington and, twice, here in New York. Ambassador Kimberg represented well the activist, engaged role played by Denmark on the entire range of foreign policy questions, notably on European policy and security issues, and also here at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk04-pa03">A respected and exemplary envoy, Ambassador Kimberg will be greatly missed by the diplomatic community. We at the United States Mission join this Assembly in paying tribute to his memory and to the lasting legacy of strong international partnership that he helped to create.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Truelsen</span> <span class="nation">Denmark</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa01">I thank the members of the General Assembly for the very moving tribute they have paid to the memory of Mr. Benny Kimberg. I am deeply touched by the words that have been spoken here, and I am sure that many of my staff members who are present here in this room are very touched too. I will certainly convey these condolences to my Government and to Benny Kimberg's family.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa02">The Danish foreign service has lost -- much, much too early -- a great servant. The international community has lost an outstanding supporter, and my comments apply to the United Nations in particular. He always stood up for the United Nations; he did not accept the comments of critics, but argued with them right from the beginning. I will never forget his intellectual capacity, creativity, dedication and straightforwardness, his very unsnobbish character, and, last but not least, his extremely well developed sense of humour.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa03">We at the Mission will never forget 13 March this year when we were told that Benny had pancreatic cancer. He believed the whole way through that they would find a cure, and all of us tried to support him as much as we could. But we certainly also noted all the efforts of his colleagues and friends, who, with talks, letters and flowers, kept his spirits up during the two and a half months he had after it was discovered. I should like to take this opportunity to thank you all for that support.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk06-pa04">In the light of what has been said here today, I am sure that we are all going to miss Benny greatly. Let me conclude by saying, "<i>au revoir, Benny</i>".</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa20">With regard to agenda item 157, entitled "Financing of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti", the report of the Fifth Committee is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-51-638-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/638/Add.2</a>. In paragraph 6 of the report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of draft resolution A/C.5/51/L.67, which was adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa21">I wish to mention also that the Committee has examined, during this part of its resumed session, item 141, "Report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services", as well as the question of gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities and the strengthening of external oversight mechanisms, under agenda item 112, "Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations", and decided to resume its work on those issues in September, since the Committee was not in a position to agree on consensus resolutions on them.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk06-pa22">Finally, concerning agenda 112, entitled "Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations", the report of the Fifth Committee is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-51-922.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/922</a>. In the report, the Committee recommends to the General Assembly the adoption of one draft resolution and two draft decisions. Draft resolution A/C.5/51/L.70 concerns procurement reform in the United Nations Secretariat. The two draft decisions deal with the reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (A/C.5/51/L.72) and with the question of management in the United Nations (A/C.5/51/L.75), respectively. The draft resolution and the draft decisions were adopted by the Committee without a vote.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Peleg</span> <span class="nation">Israel</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa01">This draft resolution, adopted by the Fifth Committee under agenda item 123 (b), is fundamentally flawed. The singling out of one country to bear the costs of the damages to a United Nations peacekeeping force attributable to a military incident is utterly unprecedented and contrary to the practice of reimbursing expenditures related to peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa02">The Fifth Committee is mandated to deal solely with non-political, budgetary and administrative issues. It has never been charged to assign political blame or responsibility for expenditures to individual Member States, but rather to act on the premise of collective responsibility and consensus. Member States are normally assessed for their payments to peacekeeping operations on the basis of their proportional share of the scale of assessments according to a determined group system. The unacceptable precedent that would be set by this draft resolution could well undermine the established method of financing peacekeeping operations, and if allowed to stand, its repercussions could play havoc with future peacekeeping operations everywhere.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa03">Moreover, it was clearly indicated in the Secretary-General's report (<a href="../pdf/A-51-535-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/535/Add.1</a>) on the Qana incident that about half of the sum in question, $880,330, represented the estimated costs of relocating a battalion headquarters which had nothing to do with the incident <i>per se</i>. The report explicitly states that</p>
	<blockquote id="pg008-bk06-pa04">"Subsequent to the incident at Qana, it was determined that it would no longer be operationally acceptable for a battalion headquarters to be located within a town that had since grown in population to encompass a headquarters position originally sited on the outskirts of the town. For this reason, it has been decided to relocate the Fijian battalion." <i>(<a href="../pdf/A-51-535-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/535/Add.1</a>, para. 13)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa05">Attributing the need to relocate the headquarters to the incident itself is, therefore, totally untrue. The headquarters had to be relocated in any event because of demographic pressures for which, absurdly, Israel is also held responsible by the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa06">The tragic events that took place at Qana on 18 April 1996 were brought on by a series of violent Hezbollah attacks against northern Israel. In the absence of any Lebanese effort or action to prevent them, Israel was left with no option but a military one. The responsibility for those events lies squarely on the shoulders of the terrorist elements who are prepared to wage their fanatic war against Israel and the peace process to the last drop of Lebanese blood. Such responsibility lies equally with the Lebanese governmental authorities who only justify, encourage and support such acts, and in doing so conveniently look the other way as others turn their country into a terrorist haven.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa07">Any damage caused to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as a result of military operations conducted in self-defence is, therefore, the direct consequence of terrorist aggression and Lebanese collusion. Both United Nations and Israeli investigations confirmed separately the activity of terrorist elements close to the UNIFIL battalion headquarters at the time. It was that activity which elicited the artillery response that is blamed for this damage.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk06-pa08">The terrorists and their patterns should be held fully accountable for such misdeeds. Israel rejects in both letter and spirit the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-51-725-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/725/Add.1</a>. Israel is bound by no legal or moral obligation to assume responsibility for reimbursing the amount referred to in paragraph 7 of this draft resolution. Israel will vote against this draft resolution.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I call now on those delegations wishing to speak in explanation of vote after the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Moubarak</span> <span class="nation">Lebanon</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">I wish first of all to say on behalf of the delegation of Lebanon that the Assembly's adoption of today's resolution on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is recognition of the fact that Israel is responsible for the costs and losses caused by the bombardment of the Qana headquarters. This resolution marks a victory not just for Lebanon, but for the credibility of the United Nations, international law, the status of international forces and international peace and security, all matters that are the responsibility of the Organization.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">When Lebanon proposed that Israel be made to bear the costs of the damage resulting from its bombing of the international headquarters at Qana, its goal was to strengthen the credibility of international forces and to show how vital it is for Lebanon to reaffirm the importance it attaches to UNIFIL, in particular because it represents the rule of international law. Everyone clearly understands the strategic importance of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a> and the role of UNIFIL as the force established by the Security Council to implement that resolution. The Force is no mere safety-valve for southern Lebanon; it is there to safeguard international peace and security in the region.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">I wish today to pay tribute, on behalf of the Government of Lebanon, to the active pioneering role played by UNIFIL. On this matter, Lebanon holds an unswerving position of principle based on the need to hold all parties responsible for their own acts with a view to deterring other parties from perpetrating similar acts and at the same time to strengthening the role and the credibility of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The Lebanese delegation also thanks the Group of 77 and China for having embraced the position of the Arab Group and Lebanon on this item. My delegation believes that the views of the international community have now been heard through the voice of the General Assembly, the body that adopts binding financial resolutions and determines whether countries are to bear the costs of their acts. By this resolution, the General Assembly has affirmed that a Member State cannot refuse to pay the bill for acts it has committed, and that such a Member State must itself bear the costs arising from its acts.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">My delegation believes that there must be an end to Israel's continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon, its failure to implement <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a> and the suffering it has caused the international forces and the local population. But we consider that the suffering will continue so long as Israel maintains its position: stubbornly to turn its back on the views of the international community and on the rule of international law.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mirmohammad</span> <span class="nation">Iran</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk03-pa01">My delegation would like to recall its position on the financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (<a href="../pdf/A-51-724-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/724/Add.1</a>) and of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (<a href="../pdf/A-51-725-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/51/725/Add.1</a>): that the expenses of these two missions should be borne by the aggressor and occupying party.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Zlenko</span> <span class="nation">Ukraine</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa01">The delegation of Ukraine voted in favour of the resolution just adopted by the General Assembly. We did so based on the fact that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) plays an important role in the process of building peace in the Middle East, which has always been supported by Ukraine. At the same time, we cannot but express our deep regret that the draft resolution on the financing of UNIFIL was adopted both in the Fifth Committee and in plenary meeting by a vote. This does not correspond to the current practice of taking budgetary decisions by consensus, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-41-213.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 41/213</a>. In this regard, we are strongly concerned that the resolution on the financing of UNIFIL, adopted by a vote, could be substantially devalued; this in turn could negatively affect the practical implementation of the mandate of a very important peacekeeping operation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk04-pa02">In our view, additional efforts should have been made between the time of the vote in the Fifth Committee and today to find a compromise decision that could have been acceptable to all delegations. Since that did not happen, the delegation of Ukraine voted in favour of the draft resolution. However, our position should not be interpreted as agreement with the departure from the practice of adopting budgetary resolutions by consensus.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Shearouse</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk01-pa01">The United States has worked in good faith over the past few weeks to find compromise language on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) that would have allowed the Fifth Committee to arrive at a consensus text that was consistent with the report of the Secretary-General, that did not set an undesirable precedent or raise issues of the legality of the Committee's action and, most important, that did not politicize the technical task assigned to the Fifth Committee: deciding on the financing of UNIFIL, an operation which is implementing a difficult and important mandate. We deeply regret that the author of the draft resolution did not seriously consider the possibilities for compromise.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sulaiman</span> <span class="nation">Syria</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">My delegation welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-51-725-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/51/725/Add.1</a>. I should like to thank all the countries that supported the resolution, in particular the Group of 77 and China. They have taken a stance in support of justice and law.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">The adoption of the resolution reflects the conviction of the international community that the aggressor should not be rewarded for its aggression. This resolution again expresses the international community's condemnation of Israel's aggression and reaffirms that Israel must bear the costs of its terrorist aggression against the United Nations headquarters in Qana, Lebanon, last year.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">That act of aggression, which is unparalleled and exceeded all limits, amounted to a systematic terrorist attack on a United Nations position in the territory of a third State -- Lebanon -- which is a State Member of the United Nations and a sovereign State. The principle of collective responsibility cannot apply when it comes to financing. No United Nations position in the territory of a sovereign third State has ever before been the target of an attack by another country. Israel cannot be permitted to commit such an attack and then call on Member States to cover the costs arising from it.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The resolution places on Israel the financial burden resulting from its attack on the United Nations headquarters at Qana. It cannot, therefore, be considered to be outside our purview, as certain delegations have alleged. It is true that this is a financial and technical matter, but even the question of feeding human beings has become political. Financial compensation by Israel, in accordance with this resolution, constitutes a minimal portion of the entire cost resulting from its act of aggression towards the United Nations headquarters at Qana. The demand for Israel to meet all the costs of its aggression is just, as is supported by the adoption of this resolution. No other State should bear the financial burden.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">The costs resulting from that act of aggression amount to $1,773,618, and must be borne in full by Israel, in accordance with the resolution, as Israel is the party responsible for the aggression. Indeed, Israel should be responsible for the bulk of the financing of the Force itself, because it is the occupation of Lebanese territory by Israel that lies at the origin of the existence of this Force. The human, financial and moral losses caused by Israel's attack and the Qana massacre exceed the figures and calculations. The effects of this aggression continue and will continue until Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa is terminated, in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-425(1978).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 425 (1978)</a>, and until Israel withdraws from all the Arab territories.</p>
