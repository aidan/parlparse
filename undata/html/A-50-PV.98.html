<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Mustafa</span><span class="nation">Sudan</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa01">It is both my honour and my pleasure to address the Assembly on behalf of the African Group to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.64-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.64/Rev.2</a>, "Situation in Rwanda: international assistance for a solution to the problem of refugees, the restoration of total peace, reconstruction and socio-economic development in Rwanda".</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa02">The draft resolution before us recalls two similar or identical resolutions: 48/211 of 21 December 1993 and 49/23 of 2 December 1994, both adopted by the General Assembly during its forty-eighth and forty-ninth sessions, respectively. It also recalls <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1029(1995).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 1029 (1995)</a> of 12 December 1995, whereby the Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) for a final period, until 8 March 1996. The new mandate focuses on the exercise of good offices to assist the return of refugees, together with assistance to the Government of Rwanda in facilitating the return of refugees, assistance to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) by providing logistical support, and support for the protection of the International Tribunal for Rwanda until alternative arrangements are made.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa03">The draft resolution we have before us notes the Secretary-General's report of 1 December 1995, the statement by the President of the Security Council of 17 October 1995, and the Secretary General's additional report on emergency international assistance for a solution to the problem of the refugees.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa04">The draft resolution refers, as well, to the serious consequences of genocide, mass killings and the destruction of the economic, social, educational and administrative infrastructure, which form the appalling background and the legacy with which Rwanda has had to grapple in recent times.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa05">In view of regional implications of the Rwandese crisis, the draft resolution refers to the plan of action recommended by the Government of Rwanda, UNHCR and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) within the framework of the Arusha Peace Agreement of 4 August 1993. The draft resolution recognizes that this Agreement is the appropriate framework for national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa06">Furthermore, the draft resolution encourages the Government of Rwanda to pursue its efforts with a view to creating conditions conductive to the voluntary return of refugees to their homeland. It commends the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General to draw the attention of the international community to the humanitarian situation in Rwanda. It welcomes, as well, the increased commitments and funds pledged for the Government's Programmes of National Reconciliation and Socio-Economic Rehabilitation Recovery. On the other hand, it calls on the international community to continue its support for Rwanda's rehabilitation programmes. It also welcomes the commitment of the Government of Rwanda to taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of all humanitarian personnel operating in the country.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa07">The draft resolution addresses the intolerable conditions in Rwanda's prisons, as well as the delays in processing cases, by calling on both the international community and the Government of Rwanda to continue their efforts to improve the situation in prisons and to accelerate the processing of cases.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa08">The draft resolution welcomes the indictments recently issued by the International Tribunal for Rwanda and calls on States to honour their obligations as established by the Security Council to arrest and detain persons suspected of genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. It encourages, as well, the Government of Rwanda to cooperate with the Secretary-General and the Tribunal to establish an effective protective force for the Tribunal.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa09">All States, in particular donor countries, are urged to contribute to the Secretary-General's trust fund for Rwanda, which was established in July 1994 in order to help finance humanitarian relief and rehabilitation programmes to be implemented in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa10">The draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to consult with the Government of Rwanda and with relevant United Nations agencies on the nature of a continued United Nations presence in Rwanda after the date of the Security Council's final extension of UNAMlR's mandate until 8 March 1996.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa11">Resolution <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1029(1995).pdf" class="pdf">1029 (1995)</a>, adopted by the Security Council last week, requested the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on 1 February 1996 on the discharge by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda of its mandate and progress towards the repatriation of refugees. Given that the tasks before Rwanda are huge and that it is likely to continue to require substantial and coordinated United Nations input, the draft resolution we have before us requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly on the same date about his consultations with the Government of Rwanda on the nature of that continued United Nations presence in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa12">As the draft resolution before us is endorsed and co-sponsored by the African Group, together with a range of other States, it is the fervent wish of the African Group that the draft resolution be adopted by consensus.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa13">It is also a great honour for me to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.43-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.43/Rev.1</a>, "Emergency assistance to the Sudan", on behalf of the African Group and China, Honduras, India, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa14">This draft resolution -- like similar texts that have been adopted at every session of the General Assembly since the forty-third session -- acknowledges the cooperation by the Government of Sudan with the United Nations to facilitate relief operations. It also takes into consideration the ongoing review of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) and stresses the need for that review to address the effectiveness, and for the efficiency of the Operation, as well as its transparency and the involvement of the Government of Sudan in the Operation. It further calls upon the international community to contribute generously to the Operation. It also calls upon the donor community and the United Nations system to provide financial, technical and medical assistance to combat malaria in the Sudan.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa15">The draft resolution contains, in addition to provisions in previous resolutions, paragraphs stressing the importance of assuring the safety of personnel providing humanitarian assistance within the OLS and appealing to all parties to the conflict to continue negotiations towards the re-establishment of peace. The draft resolution further stresses that the OLS should operate within the principle of national sovereignty of the Sudan and the framework of international cooperation in accordance with relevant international law.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa16">As this consensus text was reached after very intensive consultations with interested parties, it is the wish of the co-sponsors that it be adopted without a vote, following the example of previous sessions.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg001-bk04-pa17">On behalf of my delegation, the African Group and the co-sponsors of all the draft resolutions on assistance to African countries, I express our deep appreciation to His Excellency Ambassador Sucharipa, the Permanent Representative of Austria, for leading the informal consultations to the success reflected in the attainment of a consensus text. Our thanks go also to the able Secretariat and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, as well as to those delegations which participated in the endeavours to reach consensus texts on assistance to countries or regions under item 20 (b).</p>

	<p id="docA50PV98-pg003-bk10-pa02">The European Union has noted with concern that a substantial number of resolutions continue to be submitted which contain appeals of countries and regions for special economic assistance.

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Eteffa</span><span class="nation">Ethiopia</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa01">Allow me at the outset to express our deep appreciation to the Ambassador of Belgium for skilfully leading the negotiations on this draft resolution at the international level.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa02">As a representative of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and on behalf of African States, I have the honour to introduce draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.40-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.40/Rev.1</a>, "Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s".</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa03">It will be recalled that on 18 December 1991 the General Assembly adopted <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-151.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/151</a>, the annex to which contained the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. The New Agenda contained an expression of the renewed commitment of the international community to support Africa's own efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development. The international community accepted the principle of shared responsibility and partnership with Africa and committed itself to giving full support to African development. The question of follow-up and monitoring of the measures taken so far, and of how to proceed in the future, including the convening of a mid-term review of the implementation of the New Agenda, was viewed as essential in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-151.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/151</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa04">The draft resolution before us is in pursuance of that decision and contains 15 preambular and 12 operative paragraphs.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa05">The preambular part basically highlights the major decisions taken by the United Nations General Assembly and the Organization of African Unity as well as the summary made by the President of the Economic and Social Council during the discussion of the Council's high-level segment on the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda. The preambular paragraphs also highlight how exogenous factors, in particular the problems of external debt, inadequate resource flow, lack of progress in the diversification process of the African economies and the negative impact of the Uruguay Round agreements, affected the socio-economic recovery of Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa06">The operative part of the draft resolution takes note of the report of the Secretary General on financial intermediation and the diversification of African commodities and concentrates mainly on the mid-term-review mechanism of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa07">While preparing this draft resolution the African Group consciously avoided raising at this juncture issues of debt, flow of resources, diversification of commodities and questions of trade in general as subjects of negotiation. The African Group believes that the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda will provide to Africa and the international community an opportunity to conduct an in-depth assessment of the actions so far taken to implement the New Agenda and the measures needed for sustained economic growth and sustainable development beyond the 1990s, as well as to set out new and corrective policies and measures for strengthened external support.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa08">In substantive terms, while operative paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 make reference to the various reports of the Secretary General and the summary made by the President of the Economic and Social Council during the Council's high-level segment, operative paragraph 4 decides to establish an ad hoc committee of the whole of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly to prepare the mid-term review of the New Agenda, as provided for in the annex to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-46-151.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 46/151</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa09">Operative paragraphs 5 to 9 deal with the modalities of the mid-term review as well as indicating the roles to be played by African countries, the United Nations system and specialized agencies, the Organization of African Unity and other relevant institutions in the mid-term-review process. Although the Bretton Woods institutions are not mentioned by name, it is our understanding that those institutions should play important roles in the development of Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa10">Operative paragraphs 10 to 12 request the Secretary-General to come up with projected resource requirements for the implementation of the New Agenda and to report to the fifty-first session of the General Assembly on the work of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole and the implementation of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg005-bk01-pa11">Finally, on behalf of the African States, I request the unanimous adoption of this draft resolution by the General Assembly.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Maquieira</span><span class="nation">Chile</span><span class="language">Spanish</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa01">On behalf of the co-sponsors listed in document <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.66.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.66</a> and of Algeria, Austria, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guyana, Indonesia, Kenya, Liechtenstein, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, Turkey and Zambia, it is my pleasure to introduce the draft resolution on the implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa02">The draft resolution contains basically three parts: the preamble, and the operative portion, which is divided into two parts. I shall briefly highlight the outstanding aspects of each of the components of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa03">The fundamental aspect of the preamble, aside from citing the relevant resolutions, is the appreciation expressed to the Government and people of Denmark for the hospitality they extended to the participants at the Summit. Also highlighted is the policy decision taken at the highest level by the international community to give the highest priority to social development and human well-being now and into the twenty-first century by adopting the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa04">As regards the operative portion, it has been subdivided into two parts, the outstanding aspects of which are the following.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa05">The first part, which refers to the critical importance of national action and international cooperation for social development, includes some of the objectives from the Programme of Action and the policy Declaration in a selective manner, yet without establishing priorities. That is the case, for example, of the reaffirmation of the pledge made by the Heads of State and Government to give highest priority to national, regional and international policies and actions for the promotion of social progress; the recognition of the necessity to create a framework for action to place people at the centre of development; the emphasis on the need for a renewed and massive political will at the national and international levels to invest in people and in social well-being; and the recognition that social development and the implementation of the Programme of Action are primarily the responsibility of Governments, and that international cooperation and assistance are essential for their full implementation. Finally, on this aspect, emphasis must be placed on the need for promotion of an integrated and multidimensional approach and the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels. This is contained in operative paragraphs 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the draft resolution, where various aspects of financial matters are dealt with, including the 20/20 proposal.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa06">The second part of the operative portion of the draft resolution refers specifically to the role of the United Nations system. Generally speaking, it establishes a three-tiered structure at the intergovernmental level. Yet, at the same time, it includes the multidimensional and multisectoral aspects of the implementation of the Programme of Action in such a way that it relates the organization of the intergovernmental process to what is being developed by the specialized agencies and other interested sectors. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this part of the draft resolution is that it recognizes that the multidimensional approach exists and that there are various institutions and agencies that contribute to the implementation of the progress, without interfering with each other or bothering about hierarchy. Consequently, this aspect, the major detail of which concentrates on the intergovernmental section, recognizes that there are three levels: the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Commission for Social Development.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa07">As regards the General Assembly, especially its functions as a principal organ of the United Nations, the draft resolution decides to hold a special session of the General Assembly in the year 2000 for an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of the outcome of the Summit and to consider further actions.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa08">As regards the Economic and Social Council, the draft resolution reaffirms that the Council will provide overall guidance and oversee system-wide coordination in the implementation of the outcome of the Summit. It requests the Council, in the light of the progress towards implementing the outcome of the Summit, and consistent with the mandates of the Charter and in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions, to continue examining ways to strengthen its role, authority, structures, resources and processes and to bring specialized agencies into a closer working relationship with it in the implementation of the outcome of the Summit and also in the implementation of the outcomes of other conferences, which must be integrated with that of the Summit.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa09">The following provisions of the draft resolution refer in more detail to the Commission for Social Development. As a result of the Copenhagen Summit, a process of marked revitalization of that Commission is required. Consequently, the draft resolution calls on the Commission to develop a multi-year programme of work to the year 2000, selecting specific themes and addressing them from an integrated perspective. Further on, endorsing the first resolution on reform of the Economic and Social Council, it requests the Commission to adapt its mandate, to integrate sectoral issues, to review its methods of work and to establish the practice of inviting experts to contribute to its work to ensure that this work is not limited to the intergovernmental process but enjoys the participation of civil society.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa10">With the three tiers of the intergovernmental process established -- the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and the Commission for Social Development -- the draft resolution goes on to request various entities to contribute to the process. Such is the case with the regional commissions, which should meet biennially on appropriate issues of the implementation of the World Summit for Social Development.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa11">The draft resolution takes note of the creation of the well-known task forces for the follow-up to the Summit, invites the International Labour Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to be actively involved in the follow-up to the Summit, and, finally, requests the Secretary-General to establish within the Secretariat an entity with clearly assigned responsibilities to assist with the follow-up to the social Summit.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa12">In conclusion, I believe that the significant characteristic of this draft resolution is that it does not focus only on the intergovernmental level, but also integrates, in a coordinated way, the work that other entities can carry out.</p>
	<p id="docA50PV98-pg006-bk07-pa13">The draft resolution was negotiated with much interest and enthusiasm, and I would like to express appreciation to all the delegations which made contributions to the drafting. We think that the draft resolution should be adopted by consensus.</p>
