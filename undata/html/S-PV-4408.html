	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">The Security Council will now continue its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After consultation among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">"The Security Council welcomes the 1 November 2001 inauguration of Burundi's Transitional Government, and calls on all Burundians to support it and work together to ensure the success of this broad-based and inclusive government's fulfilling its functions in accordance with the agreements that led to its establishment.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">"The Security Council welcomes the continued engagement of the Regional Initiative and, in this regard, also welcomes the deployment of the first elements of the multinational security presence tasked with the protection of returning political leaders. The Council calls on all the Burundian parties to support this undertaking, and expresses its gratitude to the Government of South Africa for its contribution to the cause of peace in Burundi.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its deep appreciation to former President Nelson Mandela for his dedicated service as facilitator of the Arusha Peace Process, and reiterates its hope that the region and the international community may continue to rely on his moral leadership. The Council welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative for the Great Lakes, through the Implementation Monitoring Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">"The Security Council condemns the recent attacks by the FDD and FNL on civilians, and is gravely concerned that the frequency of such attacks has increased. The Council once again states that the installation of a broad-based government in accordance with an internationally supported peace process makes armed rebellion an unacceptable means of political expression.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa07">"The Security Council reiterates its call for an immediate suspension of hostilities in Burundi and for the armed groups to enter into negotiations to reach a definitive ceasefire, which is the priority issue. In this regard, the Council welcomes the involvement of President Bongo of Gabon and Deputy President Zuma of South Africa and expresses its full support for their efforts.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa08">"The Security Council expresses its concern at the human rights and humanitarian situation in Burundi and once again calls on the responsible parties to ensure full compliance with the relevant international conventions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa09">"The Security Council calls on the international community to increase its humanitarian assistance, as well as to assist in Burundi's economic recovery and development through, inter alia, honouring the pledges made at the Paris donors' conference."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa10">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2001-33.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2001/33</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa11">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.</p>
