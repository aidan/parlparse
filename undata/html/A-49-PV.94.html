	<div class="boldline-p" id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk02-pa02">United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s: draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.44/Rev.2</a>)</div>

<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">The President</span><span class="nation"></span><span class="language">French</span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa01">Members will recall that the General Assembly concluded its debate on agenda item 154 at its 88th plenary meeting, held on 14 December 1994.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa02">As members know, following the recommendations of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and of the Secretary-General relating to the need to establish a diversification fund for Africa's commodities within the framework of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, negotiations on this matter began during the forty-eighth session and continued during the present session. They gave rise to intense consultations among experts from Africa and from donor countries. To break the impasse that arose, I myself have conducted the consultations for the past week. After lengthy discussions, representatives of African countries and of donor countries, demonstrating a praiseworthy spirit of cooperation and a determination to find a constructive compromise, approved a consensus text that I had proposed.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa03">That text relates particularly to paragraph 12 of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.44/Rev.2</a>. It reads as follows:</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa04">"Invites State participants in the African Development Fund existing within the African Development Bank to pay particular attention to the diversification of African commodities with a view to accelerating this process, and invites them to consider urgently making an initial adequate special contribution to finance the preparatory phase of commodity diversification projects and programmes in African countries". (<i><a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.44/Rev.2</a>, para. 12</i>)</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa05">As members know, the Organization's medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 gives high priority to African economic recovery and development -- hence the special importance for African economies of the draft resolution now before the Assembly. Its adoption by consensus would certainly confirm the interest of the international community, and particularly of donor countries, in the question of the development of Africa. In that connection, it should be seen as a test of the real chances of success for the implementation of the New Agenda.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa06">Finally, I wish sincerely to thank the various parties that during the consultations demonstrated true open-mindedness and political will in seeking a compromise acceptable to all, which made it possible for the consultations on paragraph 12 of the draft resolution to succeed.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa07">The Assembly will now take a decision on draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.44/Rev.2</a>.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg001-bk03-pa08">May I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.44/Rev.2</a>?</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk03-pa01">We are pleased at the adoption today by consensus of draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.44/Rev.2</a>, on the implementation of new financing arrangements for the preparatory phase of the diversification of Africa's commodities.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk03-pa02">On behalf of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for your tireless efforts and praiseworthy contribution to the reaching of consensus on this text.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk03-pa03">We also congratulate our African colleagues and brothers and our partners from the developed countries on their constructive spirit, without which it would not have been possible for us to reach this conclusion on this vital issue which is so close to our hearts and on which negotiations have been dragging on for almost three years. Tunisia, having had the honour this year to continue these long and often difficult negotiations on behalf of the African countries, is particularly pleased at this favourable outcome, which opens up such promising possibilities.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk03-pa04">The adoption of this text is a first step towards the effective implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. We have high hopes that the decision taken today will in the future be translated into concrete action for the implementation of United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, thus proving the international community's commitment to giving priority to Africa's economic recovery and development. Such support would make it possible for African countries, in a spirit of solidarity and partnership, to overcome their difficulties and confidently tackle the attainment of their legitimate aspirations to progress, development and well-being.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk03-pa05">African countries depend on a small number of commodities for their earnings. They must therefore diversify their production and exports so that their economies can withstand without great harm the impact of fluctuations in export prices and terms of trade. In this context, the diversification of African economies is regarded as one of the priorities of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk03-pa06">Accordingly, I wish to express once again our appreciation for the interest shown by our partners from the developed countries in contributing to the success of this African development endeavour. A developed Africa with the means to participate actively in international economic cooperation will be of great benefit to its trading partners.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk03-pa07">For those reasons we appeal to the donor countries to see to it that the adoption of this resolution leads to generous contributions and clear support during the African Development Bank's consideration of this question, so that we can all honour our commitments and thus support the development efforts of the African countries.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk04-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union, Austria, Finland and Sweden.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk04-pa02">Let me first thank you, Mr. President, for your vigorous personal involvement in this complex issue.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk04-pa03">We joined the consensus on the resolution just adopted by the Assembly. The text has been discussed very intensively, and in many aspects it reflects a consensus we can support.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk04-pa04">We regret, however, that the text of operative paragraph 12 was presented to us at such a late date and that there was a lack of willingness to negotiate on it. It presents a number of difficulties for us. The negotiations on the seventh replenishment of the African Development Bank have not yet been concluded; indeed, they have reached a difficult phase. The text we adopt here must not be interpreted in a manner that prejudges the outcome of these negotiations. We believe that it is, in the first place, a matter of setting the right priorities at the African Development Bank to promote the financing of the preparatory phase of diversification projects. The European Union has made it clear in all discussions that existing mechanisms and financing should be relied upon to support diversification efforts and that the sense of urgency prevailing in this forum on this matter should be reflected in the setting of priorities within the relevant body: the African Development Bank.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk04-pa05">Our Governments will continue to approach the question of financing for diversification in the light of whether efforts are made by all concerned to use the existing resources. Our view on this issue also takes account of the fact that diversification of the commodity sector in African countries may not be primarily a question of providing financing for studies. Viable projects for diversification depend on an economic and administrative environment favourable to market-oriented initiatives from the private sector. Contributions to a bank will not in themselves elicit such projects. We also believe that it is not wise to set up new financing mechanisms or to make contributions to existing ones solely for political reasons.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg002-bk04-pa06">We understand the African countries' appeal for support for their efforts, particularly in the field of diversification, and we support these efforts in a number of ways. We will continue to have special regard for African interests and needs in our efforts to facilitate access to existing resources and mechanisms.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"><span class="name">Mr. Marrero</span><span class="nation">United States</span><span class="language"></span></h3>	<div class="spokentext">
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa01">The United States of America was pleased to join the consensus on the resolution on the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. We especially appreciate the tireless efforts made by the delegation of Tunisia, in its representation of the chairmanship of the Organization of African Unity, to draw out the prime concerns of the African States and other delegations in order to design a resolution holding meaning, clear objectives and broad-based support.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa02">The United States is a leading supporter of international efforts to assist the troubled economies of Africa. We regard this resolution as containing many positive elements. For example, we strongly support the resolution's call upon African countries to continue to take measures to improve the investment climate domestically in order to attract foreign investment. Similarly, we welcome the resolution's invitation to relevant multilateral institutions to give high priority to assistance for commodity diversification in Africa. Additionally, the United States looks forward to the Secretary-General's report, to be produced next year, on the implementation of this resolution, especially in regard to the activities of the Inter-agency Task Force for the Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa03">However, in joining the consensus on this text, we wish to underline our position on two important points: the idea of a diversification fund for Africa's commodities and the notion of convening a conference on African debt.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa04">The United States believes that it is important to note that our understanding of operative paragraph 12 of the resolution we have before us acknowledges two important principles: first, that the States participants in the African Development Fund existing within the African Development Bank are uniquely competent to make the important decisions regarding the financial focus and the priorities of the Fund; and, secondly, that it is our understanding that the invitation to participant States to consider making an initial adequate special contribution to the Fund for Africa's commodity diversification is not intended to suggest that a separate fund should be established for this purpose. During the negotiation of this resolution, the United States expressed the view repeatedly that we consider it ill-advised to set up a new commodity diversification fund or its equivalent when suitable funding sources already exist that could be used for this purpose.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa05">On the question of considering the convening of a conference on African debt, as mentioned in paragraph 9, the United States continues to oppose convening such a gathering. It is our view that international debt matters are best handled on a case-by-case basis through the international financial institutions and through the Paris Club. Many African countries have benefited substantially from this approach and will continue to do so, especially in the light of the recent Paris Club decision to seek to increase even further the response of creditor countries to the indebtedness of the poorest countries.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa06">The United States will continue to work with other creditors and international financial institutions on strategies to reduce the debt burdens of African countries in the context of their economic and structural reforms. However, we do not believe that a United Nations conference on the subject would be at all helpful in this regard. Indeed, the Paris Club's recent deliberations have addressed precisely the concerns that any additional forum on debt issues might hope to take up.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa07">We feel that it is important also to reiterate our position on the notion of</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa08">"agreed international targets of devoting 0.7 per cent of gross national product to official development assistance and 0.15 per cent to least-developed countries". (<i><a href="../pdf/A-49-L.44-Rev.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.44/Rev.2</a>, para. 10</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa09">The United States is not among the States that have accepted such targets nor have we made commitments to reach them.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg003-bk01-pa10">Finally, Mr. President, my delegation would like to take this opportunity to recognize your helpful, constructive involvement in the negotiation of this resolution. Through your timely intervention, you have exemplified again the spirit and benefit of patient dialogue and collective partnership. We thank you for affording us all one more opportunity to celebrate mutual agreement.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa02">Members will also recall that in the statement which I made at the conclusion of the debate on the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization under item 10 of the General Assembly's agenda for its forty-ninth session, I indicated that I would continue my consultations on the question of the financial situation of the United Nations and would keep the Assembly fully informed of their outcome.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa03">After intensive consultations, and in order to assist the Assembly on this important question, I have been able, in my capacity as President of the General Assembly, to submit the draft resolution which is now before the Assembly in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-L.63.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/L.63</a>. However, before the Assembly takes a decision on this draft resolution, which would establish a high-level open-ended working group, I should like to make the following comments concerning this working group.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa04">On the basis of the informal consultations which I have undertaken with delegations on the financial situation of the Organization, we are all agreed that the high-level working group to be established will consider the questions raised both in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization and in the statement made by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly on 12 October 1994, as well as the views expressed by Member States in the general debate during the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly and the views expressed by delegations during the debate on the financial situation of the United Nations that was held on an exceptional basis in plenary meetings of the Assembly on 12 December 1994.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa05">In this connection, it appears from the views expressed by delegations that the measures which could ensure a viable financial base for the Organization relate, <i>inter alia</i>, to the following questions: the payment by Member States of their contributions in full and on time; the problem of arrears in the payment of contributions by Member States; the procedure for the approval of peace-keeping budgets and appropriations; the cash-flow situation of the Organization; and methods for calculating the scale of assessments.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa06">It should, accordingly, be clearly understood that the mandate of the working group will be to consider any appropriate measure which could be introduced with a view to ensuring a sound and viable financial base for the Organization.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa07">To that end, the working group will consider all the elements, without exception, and in particular those that I have just mentioned, which contribute to the difficult financial situation the Organization is experiencing. In addition, any other element which has a bearing on the situation and which is presented by any delegation will also be considered by the working group.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa08">It is also understood that the working group will make every effort to reach the broadest possible measure of agreement on the results of its work.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg004-bk10-pa09">With regard to the timetable for the working group, it would be desirable if the report on the progress achieved, which the working group is to submit before the end of the forty-ninth session could enable the General Assembly to take the appropriate measures in time to provide the Organization with a viable financial base commensurate with the challenges it will have to face after its fiftieth anniversary.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg005-bk01-pa03">As regards conference services, it is understood that the open-ended working group would hold approximately 36 meetings from January to September 1995. The meetings would require the provision of interpretation and documentation -- 48 pages pre-session, 200 pages in-session, and 24 pages post-session -- services in the six official languages of the Organization. The actual schedule of the meetings of the working group will be decided in consultation with the Office of Conference and Support Services.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg005-bk01-pa04">Provision was made in the proposed programme budget not only for meetings programmed at that time but also for meetings that would be authorized subsequently, provided that the number and distribution of meetings were consistent with the pattern in previous years. On that basis, it is assumed that conference-servicing requirements for the meetings of the working group would be met from within resources programmed under sub-section E of section 25, "Office of Conference and Support Services", of the programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg012-bk09-pa01">The United Kingdom joined the consensus on the resolution entitled "Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime", despite substantial reservations of a technical and procedural nature, because it did not wish to mute the resolution's political message - namely, that the General Assembly welcomes the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime. That is a message which the United Kingdom wholeheartedly endorses.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg012-bk09-pa02">But the United Kingdom does not believe that a conference on a specific sector of United Nations-related activity, even one convened at ministerial level, is able to determine the relative priority of that activity when set against all other aspects of the work of the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg012-bk09-pa03">The General Assembly is equipped to do this, but the United Kingdom would like to place it on record that, despite our delegation's efforts to stimulate discussion on those aspects of this text that attempt to address issues of budgetary prioritization, no opportunity to comment upon the draft was forthcoming.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg015-bk03-pa02">The United States appreciates the difficulty of drafting language which encompasses the vast and diverse issues surrounding refugee flows in Africa. It is for that very reason that we have in past years questioned both the inclusiveness and the accuracy of the way in which this perennial draft resolution purports to address the refugee situation in Africa. We look forward to working with the sponsors and supporters of next year's draft resolution on this item during the preliminary drafting stages at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. We encourage other interested parties to join us in this effort so that we can collectively, in a spirit of good will and cooperation, develop a meaningful text that reflects the current situation of all refugees in Africa.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg015-bk03-pa03">To facilitate our work in this regard, we may want to avail ourselves of the annual session of the Executive Committee of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the collective wisdom and experience of the experts on refugees, who attend that session, to discuss the possible elements of a draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly at its next session.</p>

We believe that such protection can be granted only on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis following consideration of the particular circumstances of each individual.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg015-bk04-pa02">It is with that reservation that Turkey takes note of the definition of temporary protection included in the conclusions with respect to international protection that are contained in the report of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the work of its forty-fifth session.</p>

Our position is based on the following considerations:</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg016-bk16-pa02">We do not deny that under some special circumstances the United Nations, at the request of the countries concerned, can play a certain role in providing technical assistance in connection with elections held in those countries. We are also aware of and fully understand the desire of some countries for assistance of this kind to be provided by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg016-bk16-pa03">However, we have always held that elections are internal affairs of the State. In accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, it is beyond the purview of the United Nations to interfere in the internal electoral affairs of Member States. But the draft resolution sponsored by the United States and other countries is aimed at actively involving the United Nations in the whole electoral process -- before, during and after elections -- as well as in the so-called democratization process. Furthermore, the draft resolution seeks to establish a link between the United Nations and agencies that have no such authorization. This is not in keeping with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, we cannot support the draft resolution.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg017-bk01-pa02">During our discussions of this draft resolution in the Third Committee, it was understood that the French wording of the title would be "<i>Décennie des Nations Unies pour l'éducation dans le domaine des droits de l'homme".</i> All the other language versions use the word "education" in the title. Indeed, consensus was reached in the Third Committee that the word <i>éducation </i>would be used, and not <i>enseignement</i>. We wish to point out that the word <i>enseignement </i>would limit the action we have in mind, which indeed is education.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg017-bk02-pa01">Draft resolution XII in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-610-Add.2.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/610/Add.2</a>, entitled "Strengthening the role of the United Nations in enhancing the effectiveness of periodic and genuine elections and the promotion of democratization", continues to stray quite notably from the norms established by Member States in connection with electoral assistance. Cuba reiterates that national electoral processes fall strictly within the domestic jurisdiction of States and are a fundamental expression of their political sovereignty. That is why Cuba also reaffirms that it is up to peoples to determine the methods and establish the appropriate institutions for their electoral processes, in conformity with their Constitutions and national legislation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg017-bk02-pa02">We would also repeat that, despite what draft resolution XII implies, there does not exist, any universal need for the United Nations to give electoral assistance to Member States; this can be done only in very specific circumstances and only at the express request of a sovereign State. These exceptional cases, however, can in no way form the basis for a general principle underlying action by the United Nations and Member States.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg017-bk02-pa03">None the less, draft resolution XII seems to condition the legitimacy of national electoral processes on an evaluation made by the United Nations and subordinates the extension of electoral assistance to the results of that evaluation. This makes national institutions and indigenous political practices subject to norms and models that are allegedly universal and disregards the diversity of political systems, cultures and traditions of the States Members of this Organization.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg017-bk02-pa04">But, above and beyond this intention, draft resolution XII includes new provisions that would distort and disregard the mandates of certain bodies of the United Nations, with the aim of involving them in tasks that are alien to their proper functions. At the same time, the aim is to extend electoral assistance at the pre- and post-electoral stages on the pretext of consolidating democracy, while in what is involved is legitimizing interference in the domestic affairs of States.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg017-bk02-pa05">In this context, we are also concerned over the recent administrative decision taken by the Secretariat, without consultations and in violation of provisions established in many General Assembly resolutions, to transfer the newly named Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs to the Department of Peace-keeping Operations. This decision has serious political and administrative consequences and must be corrected as swiftly as possible.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg017-bk02-pa06">For all those reasons, Cuba cannot vote in favour of draft resolution XII.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa01">My delegation has gladly joined the consensus on draft resolution VII, entitled "Human rights and terrorism", since it addresses a concern that India has repeatedly voiced at the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa02">We are gratified that the international community has endorsed our view that the violation, indeed the destruction, of human rights, particularly the right to life of innocent and law-abiding citizens by terrorists on any pretext should be condemned, and that global measures should be taken not only to combat terrorism but also to provide succour to the victims of terrorism.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa03">The present resolution, together with the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism that the Assembly adopted earlier this year, marks a significant step towards the formulation of a comprehensive international convention on terrorism that India has called for.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa04">Our position stands vindicated. As a nation that has been a victim of terrorism from across the border, India is acutely aware of the devastation that terrorism can cause not only to life and property but also to the very institutions established to protect and promote the human rights of citizens.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa05">The policy of some States which minimize the gravity of terrorist acts by treating them as less serious than actions of States that violate human rights is perplexing to us. States, by their very nature, have legal and constitutional restraints on them, while the terrorists are a law unto themselves, and they engage in the most heinous of crimes, which deserve strong condemnation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa06">Addressing the Security Council in January 1992, the Prime Minister of India, Mr. P. V. Narashima Rao, said:</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa07">"...we cannot countenance a situation where all human rights are reserved only for the practitioners of terrorism, while Governments dealing with this menace are arraigned day and night on grounds of violation of human rights -- real or imaginary, mostly the latter." <i>(S/PV.3046, p. 98)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa08">In this year's resolution on human rights and terrorism the obligation of the international community to assist the victims of terrorism has been recognized. The leader of the Indian delegation to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session specifically suggested this during the general debate. He said:</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa09">"The international community must also provide the necessary succour to the victims of terrorism, whose numbers are swelling by the day." (<i>Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-ninth Session, Plenary Meetings, 14th meeting, p. 16</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg021-bk11-pa10">We hope that the voluntary fund proposed in the resolution will be set up promptly. Similarly, we hope that the relevant human rights machinery of the United Nations will gear itself to tackle the toxin of terrorism. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, who has the mandate to protect and promote all human rights, will do well to include a strategy against terrorism in his programme of action.</p>

Therefore, we chose -- I repeat, we chose -- not to participate in the voting on the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg022-bk01-pa02">My country adheres to the principle of periodic and genuine elections, and, in accordance with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the affairs of the country must be administered on the basis of public votes, through the election of the President, representatives of the Consultative Assembly and members of the Council, or through referendums on certain important economic, cultural and political issues. In practice, since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, 21 presidential and parliamentary elections have been held in the country, with the participation of a majority of the population.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg022-bk06-pa01">In a few minutes the General Assembly will be concluding an exercise that, besides being selective and discriminatory, is one of the greatest injustices in the recent history of this Organization and an inexcusable concession to the use of force by a great Power in its unremitting attempt to bring a small country to its knees. Draft resolution V, introduced by the United States and entitled "Situation of human rights in Cuba" -- like the similar draft resolutions introduced in the past -- is one more act of aggression in the context of that country's hostile policy towards mine.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg022-bk06-pa02">The Government of the United States, instigator of the farce that has led to this situation, is utterly lacking in the political or moral authority to set itself up as the arbiter of human rights in Cuba -- not only because it is an inveterate violator of those rights in its own territory or because it has historically supported the most repressive regimes since the Second World War, but also, and most particularly, because through its policy and through the genocidal blockade it keeps in place against my country is massively, flagrantly and systematically violating the human rights of 11 million Cubans.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg022-bk06-pa03">Cuba, which has done so much to guarantee the human rights of its people within a broader concept of freedom and social justice and which has shown great solidarity with others in their suffering, does not consider itself accused or on trial here. It will move forward in its historic endeavour of independence and national dignity and will continue to develop its policy of opening up to the world. It will continue to make those changes required by its sovereignty and the will of its people, and it will maintain constant cooperation with the United Nations on the basis of the principles of universality, impartiality and non-selectivity. It will never tire of rejecting and denouncing, time and time again, as often as is necessary, the kind of ploy we are witnessing today; nor will it ever accept a major Power's interference with the independence and sovereignty of its people.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg022-bk06-pa04">For all those reasons, Cuba will vote against draft resolution V contained in document <a href="../pdf/A-49-610-Add.3.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/610/Add.3</a>.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg027-bk11-pa01">My explanation of vote concerns draft resolution VII; on the situation of human rights in Iran. Cape Verde voted in favour of the draft resolution, but we would like to express our disappointment at the way in which it and other draft resolutions relating to items before the Third Committee were handled: private and restricted discussions, personal contacts and, finally, <i>faits accomplis</i>.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg027-bk11-pa02">The resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran could, in fact, be more balanced in its emphasis and wording, reflecting in a more complete way the conditionalities and nuances reported by the Special Representative in his report. It could have been the product of a broader scope of opinions and approaches - but this could have been possible only with more transparent, extensive and participative consultations.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg027-bk11-pa03">Finally, on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations, we believe that if it is to fulfil the basic principles which assist the promotion, implementation and protection of human rights world-wide, the General Assembly will have to be able to address with similar vigour and determination other cases of violations of human rights in other parts of the world that are of the same nature and gravity as the classic cases which have been addressed by the Third Committee.</p>

Kosovo is an integral part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose sovereignty and territorial integrity as a sovereign State should be respected. The General Assembly's resolutions should be in stricter conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and should respect national sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk02-pa03">However, my delegation also wishes to place on record its reservations concerning the title of the resolution, which is directed not at the general or national human rights situation in a country, but, rather, at a territorial part of a country.

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa01">Allow me to express my profound thanks to you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to speak on draft resolution XI on the situation of human rights in Rwanda.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa02">The Rwandese delegation wishes first to thank those countries that have been good enough to show their interest in the human rights situation in Rwanda, even if we must regret that this gesture has come a bit late, following the death of 1 million people during the civil war.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa03">In the specific context of human rights in my country, my delegation must point out that the national coalition Government established on 19 July 1994 has faced the following obstacles.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa04">Many criminals who committed or encouraged genocide did not flee; they took shelter in the south-west security zone during Operation Turquoise. This made for precarious security within the country. The Government of Rwanda has inherited a country that has been destroyed, looted, drained and deeply traumatized by genocide and other massacres.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa05">The judicial institutions of the country have been decimated, which makes it difficult for the new Government to carry out its task of rendering justice; for there is a dire shortage of magistrates and adequate legal structures.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa06">Nevertheless, although it is only five months old, my Government has the following achievements to its credit.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa07">On the political level, the country is being governed by a broad-based Government of national unity reflecting all the political trends in the nation. All sectors of society are integrated in the various national institutions, with the exception of the sectors implicated in the genocide.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa08">On the military level, more than 2,500 soldiers from the former Government forces have been incorporated into the Rwandese Patriotic Army.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa09">On the administrative level, we have set up a territorial administration which favours national reconciliation, as is shown by the fact that all but one of the civil prefects have been appointed and two prefects of the former regime have been reinstated.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa10">In the economic, administrative and social spheres, various obstacles have been put in the path of the national coalition Government's efforts, the absence or shortage of the necessary resources and personnel is impeding progress.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa11">As for training and information, at major rallies regularly held throughout the country, the President of the Republic, the Vice-President and the Prime Minister are calling for reconciliation and peace.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa12">On the question of national representation, the recently established National Assembly consists of the representatives of all sectors of our society, including the army.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa13">Despite the lack of resources, the Government is defending human rights and ensuring their strict observance -- unlike the sinister advocates and perpetrators of genocide, with whose adventures the international community is very familiar. As for strict compliance with human rights, my Government deserves not harsh criticism but, rather, economic, technical and material assistance and moral support for our good intentions, to enable us to carry out the policy we have decided on: to the establishment of a State of law on the basis of universal respect for human rights.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa14">My delegation believes that if a country wishes to have a resolution adopted that it deems useful for another country, the latter should of course be associated in the drafting of that resolution. My delegation has the right to speak freely on a sensitive subject like human rights, and I therefore have the right to express regret that we were not closely associated from the very outset in the drafting of the text of the draft resolution concerning my country. It is true that operative paragraphs 7 and 8 were slightly amended upon the request of my delegation, which sought to have the resolution make it clear that the policies of the new Rwandese administration were far removed from any planned violation of human rights.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa15">We had intended to make this clarification on the human rights situation in Rwanda in the Third Committee on 14 December 1994. It is highly regrettable that on that day pressure was exerted on the delegation of Rwanda and on the representative who had been authorized to make such a statement, and he was obliged to keep silent.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa16">The national coalition Government, only five months old, has inherited a looted, ravaged and drained country, with a decimated population and with all the vital sectors of the State in need of reconstruction. We hope that the international community will be more understanding towards the Government of Rwanda. All we are asking for is help to help ourselves.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa17">Again I thank the countries that are kind enough to support Rwanda in its efforts to resolve its situation.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg028-bk04-pa18">We associated ourselves with the consensus on this draft resolution, but we wished to make this clarification.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg029-bk02-pa02">I should like to point out at the outset that in any case India should not have explained its vote, because it was a sponsor of that draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg029-bk02-pa03">But I wish to point out something else. The representative of India, in his so-called explanation of vote on the draft resolution concerning human rights and terrorism, tried to project India as an innocent victim of terrorism. By innuendo, he tried to give the impression that India was the victim of terrorism from across the border. I do concede that the people of the Indian Union are victims of terrorism -- but not from across the border; they are victims of terrorism from within India, the terrorism unleashed by the Indian security forces in all parts of India.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg029-bk02-pa04">Pakistan does not want to dilate on this point. We are concerned only with the distortion of the resolution on human rights and terrorism and its use by India in the context of the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir. The main sponsor of the resolution, Turkey, in its statement before action was taken on the draft resolution in the Third Committee, clearly indicated that the draft resolution did not militate against the right of peoples under alien domination and foreign occupation to self-determination. Pakistan also believes that the resolution on human rights and terrorism is without prejudice to the struggle of peoples under alien domination and foreign occupation for the exercise of their right to self-determination.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg029-bk02-pa05">Finally, the indigenous struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for the exercise of their right to self-determination cannot be characterized as "terrorism". Those who are suppressing that right of the Kashmiri people are guilty of State terrorism.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa01">My delegation will join the plenary consensus on draft resolution II, entitled "Need to adopt efficient international measures for the prevention and eradication of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography", despite the fact that it contains an inaccurate and misleading reference to the sale of children's organs. My delegation attempted to delete this reference by amendment during the Third Committee's consideration of this draft. The amendment failed, but my delegation joined the consensus on the Committee draft we have before us.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa02">The United States Government strongly objects to the inclusion in future resolutions of the United Nations of wording regarding the sale of children's organs.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa03">If such a practice could be proved to exist, the United States Government would condemn it in the strongest terms. Fortunately for all children, no credible evidence has been found to support these references. My delegation, both here and in the Commission on Human Rights, has repeatedly asked for such evidence from Governments and from non-governmental organizations, and no one has been able to provide it.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa04">In October of this year, the report of Mr. Vitit Muntarbhorn, the Special Rapporteur on child prostitution, child pornography and the sale of children, was issued. The Special Rapporteur praises the safeguards the United States carries out to prevent these practices. He notes in his report that he was unable to find credible evidence that even one instance of the sale of a child for the harvesting of organs had occurred. On the contrary, Mr. Muntarbhorn reported that innocent civilians had been assaulted owing to</p>
	<blockquote id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa05">"unfounded rumours concerning the trafficking of children for organ transplantation." <i>(<a href="../pdf/A-49-478.pdf" class="pdf">A/49/478</a>, para. 84)</i></blockquote>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa06">Specifically, the Special Rapporteur reports that in one instance during the past year a United States citizen was brutally beaten by a mob in Central America when it was falsely alleged that she was kidnapping children in order to harvest their organs for sale. She remains in a coma almost eight months after the attack.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa07">By adopting a draft resolution containing this reference, the United Nations is giving credence to unfounded rumours which demonstrably have resulted in vicious attacks on individuals. To fuel the fire of speculation, fear and rumour is the height of irresponsibility and is a misuse of this important body.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg030-bk18-pa08">We urge the sponsors of this draft resolution to give the most careful thought to this issue if it is addressed again, either at the forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights or at a future session of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="docA49PV94-pg032-bk16-pa02">We joined the consensus on the draft resolution just adopted because Brazil remains fully committed to the goals of the Decade, set forth in <a href="../pdf/A-RES-48-163.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 48/163</a>. Although many of our concerns have been met in the final text, we maintain reservations on some of its language, in particular operative paragraphs 5 and 13 (b).</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg032-bk16-pa03">The delegation of Brazil has consistently maintained that the reference made to the "draft United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-RES-49-214.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 49/214</a>, para. 5</i>) -- in the plural form suggested by the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities -- tends to prejudge important decisions still to be taken by other bodies of the United Nations on this highly complex and controversial issue. It is our understanding that the use of the expression "indigenous peoples", in the plural form, in the text of the resolution is not to be construed as having any consequence for further consideration of the matter nor any implication related to possible rights to be attributed to this terminology in international law.</p>
	<p id="docA49PV94-pg032-bk16-pa04">We would have preferred, therefore, that this resolution properly reflect the consensus formulations contained in previous texts, in particular that of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.</p>
