	<p id="pg001-bk03-pa02">I request the Rapporteur of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, Mr. Reniery Valladares-Gómez of Honduras, to introduce in one intervention the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee).</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Valladares-Gómez</span> <span class="nation">Honduras</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa01">It is a great pleasure for me to present to the General Assembly the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) on agenda items 29 to 40, 121 and 129. These reports have been issued as documents <a href="../pdf/A-62-401.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/401</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-62-414.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/414</a>. They include the texts of the draft resolutions and draft decisions recommended to the General Assembly for adoption. For the convenience of delegations, the Secretariat has prepared a checklist of reports of the Fourth Committee (A-C.4-62-INF-3).</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa02">During the main part of the sixty-second session of the General Assembly, the Fourth Committee held 24 formal meetings and adopted 24 draft resolutions and two draft decisions. The Working Group of the item 31, "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", also held formal and informal meetings to draft the text of the two draft resolutions on that item.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa03">The work of the Fourth Committee was carried out in a constructive spirit and in a results-oriented and flexible manner. The Committee held interactive dialogue sessions with the Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information on agenda item 35, entitled "Questions relating to information", with the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations and the Officer-in-Charge of the Department for Field Support on agenda item 34, entitled "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", as well as with the Secretariat under agenda item 29, entitled "Assistance in mine action".</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa04">Similarly, the Committee benefited from the interactive dialogue with the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and with panels organized by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs and the secretariat of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. This format enabled delegations to participate actively in the Committee's deliberations.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa05">The report submitted under agenda item 29, "Assistance in mine action", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-401.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/401</a>. The draft resolution submitted under that agenda item is contained in paragraph 10 of the report of the Fourth Committee and was adopted by the Committee without a vote. In conformity with the provisions of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-58-316.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 58/316</a>, this item is to be considered every two years and will next be taken up at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa06">The report submitted under agenda item 30, entitled "Effects of atomic radiation", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-402.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/402</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-46.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/46</a>. We had a very informative presentation on this subject by the Secretary of that Committee. The draft resolution submitted under this agenda item is contained in paragraph 11 of the report of the Fourth Committee and was adopted without a vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa07">The report submitted under agenda item 31, entitled "International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-403.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/403</a>. In preparing the draft resolutions submitted under that item, the Working Group of the Whole established by the Fourth Committee and chaired by the delegation of France held several formal and informal meetings. The Working Group prepared two draft resolutions, set out in paragraph 14 of the report; the Committee adopted them, as a whole, without a vote, although one paragraph of draft resolution II was retained by a recorded vote.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa08">The report submitted under agenda item 32, entitled "United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-404.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/404</a>. The Fourth Committee considered the report of the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) (<a href="../pdf/A-62-13.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/13</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-62-13-Add.1.pdf" class="pdf">Add.1</a>), as well as the report of the Working Group on the Financing of UNRWA (<a href="../pdf/A-62-361.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/361</a>) and various reports of the Secretary-General. Under this item, the Committee adopted four draft resolutions by recorded votes. The draft resolutions submitted under this agenda item are contained in paragraph 15 of the report of the Fourth Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa09">In these draft resolutions, the Fourth Committee recommends, inter alia, the extension of UNRWA's mandate for five years, until 2011. The Fourth Committee recommends that these draft resolutions be adopted by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa10">The report on agenda item 33, entitled "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-405.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/405</a>.

The Fourth Committee held an interactive dialogue with Mr. Jean-Marie Guéhenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, and Ms. Jane Holl Lute, Officer-in-Charge of the recently established Department for Field Support, and held a general debate on this item. The Committee will resume its consideration of the item after receiving the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations next year.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa12">The report submitted under agenda item 35, entitled "Questions relating to information", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-407.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/407</a>. The Fourth Committee reviewed the report of the Committee on Information and the report of the Secretary-General, and heard a statement by Mr. Kyotaka Akasaka, Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information. The Committee also held an interactive dialogue on this item with the Under-Secretary-General. The Committee adopted without a vote two draft resolutions that appear in paragraph 8 of its report.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa13">The Fourth Committee considered the decolonization items together and held a single debate on all of those items.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa14">The report submitted under agenda item 36, entitled "Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-408.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/408</a>. The draft resolution submitted under this item appears in paragraph 7 of the report. The Fourth Committee recommends that the draft resolution be adopted by the General Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa15">The report submitted under agenda item 37, entitled "Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories", is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-409.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/409</a>.

	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa20">I wish to congratulate all delegations on the remarkable spirit of cooperation that prevailed during this session of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee). On behalf of the Bureau of the Committee, I should like to express our deep gratitude to the delegations, whose tireless efforts and expressions of goodwill led the Committee to adopt the draft resolutions before it. I also wish to thank all delegations that helped the Committee to reach consensus on many draft resolutions and draft decisions.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa21">I wish to pay a special and well-deserved tribute to Ambassador Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad of the Sudan, Chairman of the Fourth Committee. His in-depth knowledge of and interest in the broad range of issues considered by the Committee enabled him to lead us with great effectiveness. His vision proved invaluable to the Committee's smooth consideration of a number of particularly complex items on its agenda.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa22">I also wish to thank the other members of the Bureau -- Mr. Alexandros Vidouris of Greece, Ms. Viktoriia Kuvshynnykova of Ukraine and Mr. Hossein Maleki of the Islamic Republic of Iran -- with whom I had the pleasure of working and who contributed significantly to the successful conclusion of this stage of the work of the Fourth Committee. In addition, I wish to thank Mr. Saijin Zhang, Secretary of the Committee, and Mr. Peter Kenilorea, Deputy Secretary, for their expert advice and assistance and to thank the rest of the dedicated team of the Committee's secretariat for their valuable support.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa23">Finally, I respectfully submit to the General Assembly for its consideration and approval the recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), which are included in the reports contained in documents <a href="../pdf/A-62-401.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/401</a> to <a href="../pdf/A-62-414.pdf" class="pdf">A/62/414</a>.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01"> If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee that are before the Assembly today.</p>

	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa01">Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote. The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records. May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, the General Assembly agreed that when the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa02">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa03">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, unless the Secretariat is notified to the contrary in advance. That means that where recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Special Political and Decolonization Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa04">Before proceeding further, I would like to draw the attention of members to a note by the Secretariat, entitled "Checklist of reports of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) to the General Assembly on agenda items 29 to 40, 121 and 129", which has been circulated as document A-C.4-62-INF-3. The note has been distributed desk to desk in the General Assembly Hall as a reference guide for action on draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the Special Political and Decolonization Committee in its reports.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk03-pa05">In that connection, Members will find, in column 2 of the note, the numbers of the draft resolutions or decisions of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), with the corresponding symbols of the reports for action in the plenary in column 5 of the same note.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Salsabili</span> <span class="nation">Iran</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa01">My delegation voted in favour of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-108.pdf" class="pdf">resolutions 62/108</a> and <a href="../pdf/A-RES-62-109.pdf" class="pdf">62/109</a> under item 33, "Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories", in order to reiterate our solidarity and sympathy with the Palestinian people. Our positions with regard to the question of Palestine are well known and, therefore, we wish to place on record our reservations on certain paragraphs of these resolutions that may not be in line with the stated positions and policies of my country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa02">To the knowledge of all, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been unwavering in its full support for the Palestinian people in their endeavours to attain their national rights, dignity and aspirations and has supported the legal and democratic Government of Palestine. In that context, the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that the issue of Palestinians' internal differences is a matter of a purely internal nature and should therefore be addressed by the Palestinians themselves. The references made to certain internal issues of Palestine in some of these resolutions are not helpful, may be construed by many Palestinians as outside interference in their domestic affairs and, as a consequence, may further exacerbate the current dangerous situation. Indeed, the internal issues of Palestine should be dealt with internally, through national dialogue and in the process of national reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa03">The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to emphasize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, who have been suffering under occupation and brutal oppression for decades, and stresses the importance of support by the international community for the Palestinians struggle against foreign occupation and aggression.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa04">The Islamic Republic of Iran emphasizes that the settlement of the Palestinian issue would be achievable only if the inalienable rights of the people of occupied Palestine were fully and unconditionally realized. Regrettably, previous initiatives for the settlement of the issue have not contributed to the solution of this long-standing crisis, due to their lack of attention to the root causes of the crisis. The recent conference seems to have met the same fate.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk04-pa05">We believe that a durable peace in Palestine will be possible through justice, an end to discrimination, an end to the occupation of all Palestinian territories, the return of all Palestinian refugees, a resort to democratic means to determine the wishes of the people and the establishment of a democratic Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.</p>

The current paragraph 6 should be replaced with the following text:</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Bethel</span> <span class="nation">Bahamas</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa01">The member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) at the United Nations, along with the sponsors, are pleased to introduce for adoption today the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.32.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/L.32</a>, entitled "Permanent Memorial to and Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade". We thank Botswana, which signed on behalf of the African Group, as well as other States Members of the United Nations, for their co-sponsorship in support of this important draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa02">I would like at this point also to name the other countries that have since signed up as co-sponsors of the draft resolution but are not listed on the text itself. Those countries are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Singapore, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, the Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand and Turkey. We thank all of them.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa03">The draft resolution before us today, which essentially is procedural in nature, is twofold in its focus. First, it highlights an idea first emanating from CARICOM arising from the 26 March plenary meeting of the General Assembly in commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade and endorsed by the Council on Foreign and Community Relations of CARICOM for the establishment of a permanent memorial, to be prominently placed in the halls of the United Nations, to the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa04">The permanent memorial will stand as an acknowledgement of one of the most horrific tragedies of modern history, often forgotten, and as a reminder of the struggle and triumph over the enslavement and dehumanization of a single race over four centuries for economic gain, and the legacy it has left behind. Its placement at the United Nations will be a significant symbol of what the United Nations represents -- the promotion and preservation of the dignity and worth of all human beings, which is an integral provision of and central to the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa05">The establishment of the permanent memorial will significantly serve as a tangible contribution by the international community to partially implement paragraph 101 of the Durban Declaration, which, inter alia, invites the international community to honour the memory of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa06">The draft resolution recognizes the establishment of a fund -- the permanent memorial fund -- which has been set up under the custody of the permanent mission of Jamaica towards the realization of the memorial. It acknowledges with appreciation contributions received thus far from Member States, while also inviting other interested parties to contribute as well.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa07">The draft resolution also seeks to designate 25 March as an annual international day of remembrance of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, beginning in 2008. The significance of that date is of historic importance, recalling 200 years ago on that date the ultimate concession to the abolition advocates as their untiring efforts finally led to the passage of the act in the British Parliament calling for the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in the British Empire, which served as an important trigger for the end if the heinous act of slavery all over the world. That date was also recognized during the sixty-first session by this Assembly as the International Day for the Commemoration of the Two-hundredth Anniversary of the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa08">The proposed annual remembrance day, linked to the accomplishment of the abolitionists, will serve as a valuable complement to the existing UNESCO International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, whose date of 23 August aptly recognizes the historic important contribution of the slaves themselves, who rose up in resistance to slavery and engineered their own emancipation in our CARICOM sister country, Haiti.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa09">Racism, racial discrimination and prejudice continue to cast a destructive stain and shadow on societies across the globe. The roots and linkages with slavery and the transatlantic slave trade are clearly established. The work being pursued in the context of UNESCO through the Slave Route Project will help to address the ignorance and knowledge gap in understanding the impact and consequences of slavery and the slave trade.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa10">By adopting the draft resolution, the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General, in collaboration with and building upon the work undertaken by UNESCO, to establish a programme of outreach to mobilize, inter alia, educational institutions and civil society in order to inculcate future generations with the causes, consequences and lessons of the transatlantic slave trade and to inform of the dangers of racism and prejudice.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa11">The General Assembly, by its adoption of this important draft resolution, hopefully by consensus, would undertake in a unique, unprecedented and powerful way to memorialize the victims of slavery and the horrific transatlantic slave trade, while recognizing its continuing impact on the descendants of the slave trade and the African diaspora, many of whom are in this Assembly today. It will, in a practical and deliberate way, engage in a programme of educational outreach with a view to addressing the dangers of racism and prejudice that continue to threaten the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms today.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa12">The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in his report to the Third Committee just a few weeks ago, confirmed what we already know about new and persistent challenges in the fight against racism. We as Member States must employ all strategies at our disposal to combat that scourge from all ends, seek to correct historical injustices, and bring atonement as a part of the struggle against the ills of the past.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa13">Last Friday, CARICOM, in association with the Department of Public Information (DPI) and supporting Member States, brought to the United Nations a rare celebration of the culture and diversity of the African diaspora in a cultural event held in the Trusteeship Council Chamber. We express our deep appreciation to the permanent missions of the Netherlands and Spain for their support, as well as to DPI for its role in facilitating the cultural exposé. That was an important finale to the commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary, which CARICOM is proud to have initiated. We express our heartfelt thanks to all present for their overwhelming support.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk05-pa14">The States members of CARICOM once again thank the many sponsors and supporters of the draft resolution and now call upon the General Assembly to give its unequivocal support to its adoption as a successful conclusion to a process begun last year in this very Hall.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wolfe</span> <span class="nation">Jamaica</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa01">Jamaica join its Caribbean Community (CARICOM) partners in welcoming the General Assembly's consideration of agenda Item 119, entitled "Commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade", together with the report of the Secretary-General submitted in accordance with <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-19.pdf" class="pdf">General Assembly resolution 61/19</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa02">My delegation is very proud to align itself with the statement made by Ms. Paulette Bethel, Permanent Representative of the Bahamas, in her capacity as chair of the caucus of the CARICOM group of permanent representatives and on behalf of the sponsors of <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.32.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.32</a>, entitled "Permanent Memorial to and Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade".</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa03">My delegation fully supports the draft resolution, which would, inter alia, have the international community give tangible expression, in an appropriately noble, dignified and yet practical manner, to the implementation of paragraph 101 of the Declaration of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, aimed at countering the legacy of slavery and contributing to the restoration of the dignity of the victims of slavery and the slave trade.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa04">Accordingly, the draft resolution would have the General Assembly welcome and indeed support and endorse the initiative of the States members of the Caribbean Community, supported by other Member States, to erect in the halls of the United Nations a permanent memorial under the theme "Acknowledging the tragedy, considering the legacy, lest we forget".</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa05">Jamaica and its CARICOM partners believe that this would be a tangible, fitting monument to the memory of the victims of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery. It also represents a unique opportunity for the international community to honour the memory of the victims in this symbolic United Nations building, which represents the hopes, collective aspirations and ideals of the entire world community, as reflected in the United Nations Charter.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa06">It is therefore against that backdrop that we would urge all delegations to consider the profound significance of the draft resolution, which seeks to honour and restore some level of dignity to the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, when taking into account any other attendant considerations relevant to the adoption of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa07">As we review the state of our world today, it appears abundantly evident that the tragic legacy and consequences of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade remain with us, especially the continued political, social and economical impact.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa08">In remembrance of the victims, we are also deciding on establishing an international day for the remembrance of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade and, in that regard, the draft resolution seeks to galvanize the firm resolve of the international community that such horrific acts, which so dehumanized the victims and stripped them of their dignity, spirit and self-worth, should never be forgotten or allowed to recur, for the benefit of future generations.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa09">It is precisely for that reason that the draft resolution requests the Secretary-General, in collaboration with and building upon the work undertaken by UNESCO, to establish a programme of educational outreach to mobilize, inter alia, educational institutions and civil society on the subject of remembering the transatlantic slave trade and slavery. As indicated in the draft resolution, the main purpose is to inculcate future generations with the causes, consequences and lessons of the transatlantic slave trade and to inform of the dangers of racism and slavery.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa10">The programme of educational outreach, as contemplated in the draft resolution, and which is indeed of critical importance to its implementation, should not present any significant budgetary implications beyond that approved by the General Assembly for other similar events and programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa11">My delegation would also like to emphasize that, rather than seeking to impose any burden on the regular budget of the United Nations, CARICOM member States have in fact moved to establish a voluntary fund, called the permanent memorial fund, under Jamaica's custody, for the permanent memorial. In that regard, we join in expressing sincere appreciation to those Member States which have already contributed to the fund and invite other interested representatives to do so, as outlined in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa12">Beyond the adoption of the draft resolution, my delegation looks forward with keen anticipation to the establishment of a committee and a board of governors, representative of the membership of the United Nations, to advance the initiative for the construction of the permanent memorial, including discussions on a possible design, as well as the management and oversight of the permanent memorial fund.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk01-pa13">In conclusion, my delegation joins our sister CARICOM partners and other sponsors in urging the Assembly to support <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.32.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.32</a> and to adopt it by consensus.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg022-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Núñez Mordoche</span> <span class="nation">Cuba</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa01">The transatlantic trade in African slaves represented one of the most sordid, heartbreaking and bloody chapters in modern history. It is clear that the tragedies of slavery and the slave trade were crimes against humanity. While it is estimated that the slave trade affected 15 million to 28 million Africans between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, there are even gloomier estimates of up to twice that number.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa02">The insatiable lust for profit on the part of European slave traders and the limitless greed of nascent capitalism created a need for slave labour to build the great colonial empires of the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The slave trade was driven principally by the commercial needs of European countries. The various areas involved in that business were important players in the industrial and commercial revolution. Many of the most important European cities, from Liverpool to Amsterdam and other well-known urban areas, achieved their great economic development as a result of the trade.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa03">In Cuba, that reality has left deep physical marks in the form of old sugar mills, coffee plantations, slave quarters and other structures that remain in our countryside, some of them already blended into our natural landscape. As part of the cruel trade, approximately 1.3 million slaves from the African continent arrived on our island. The arrival of Lukumí, Carabalies, Congos, Gangas, Minas, Bibies, Yorubas and other ethnic groups had an immediate impact on the colonial society of the time and, through a complex transcultural process, gave rise to the Cuban nationality, which is essentially an Hispanic-African mixture.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa04">However, many of the slaves brought by force did not resign themselves to being exploited. Those who decided to run away from the whips of the foremen and the humiliation of the plantations embodied the principle of the spirit of rebellion and emancipation of the Cuban people. In Cuba today, the runaway slave and the hiding place are symbols of an entire people's struggle for its independence and sovereignty.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa05">Referring to the slave trade histories similar to that of Cuba were repeated virtually throughout the American continent and the Caribbean. The slave route was an intrinsic part of the brutal exploitation and impoverishment of the African continent and the cruel discrimination suffered for many years by the descendants of slaves in the western hemisphere. Nor can there be any doubt that colonialism led to racism and racial discrimination or that the suffering caused by colonialism must be condemned.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa06">For all those reasons, at the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban in 2001 and in which nearly all those present in this Hall participated, we acknowledged that the historical injustices of the slave trade, slavery and colonialism contributed to the poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and economic disparities suffered throughout the world, particularly in developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa07">Nevertheless, today we see with astonishment that many of those who promoted and benefited from the affront of slavery ignore, justify or, worse yet, try to erase the sad chapter in the history of humanity represented by the slave trade and slavery. These are the same countries that seek to set themselves up as judges of everyone, while remembering little or nothing about the crimes that they themselves committed. Those who built their vast fortunes on the sweat and blood of slaves and mired our nations in the disastrous consequences of monoproduction and monoculture cannot now wash their hands of their dark past through historical amnesia.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa08">It is neither moral nor ethical that those who live in opulence thanks in part to slavery now oppose any formula, no matter how simple, aimed at ensuring that the former colonial cities honour their historical debt to those who suffered slavery for centuries. This is occurring in the midst of neoliberal globalization, in which the rich -- the same people as those in former times -- are increasingly rich and our nations are relegated to exclusion and impoverishment.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa09">Cuba supports the demand being made to the States concerned that they take effective measures to halt and reverse the enduring consequences of the horrendous crime of slavery and to fulfil their moral obligation in that regard. Although at the Durban Conference we achieved an initial rapprochement and a critical assessment of slavery and colonialism as crimes against humanity committed throughout history, we consider this an appropriate time to stress that we must still go further in examining those issues. That is why we also fully support <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.32.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.32</a>, submitted by the Caribbean Community.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa10">Cuba, despite the fact that it is being subjected to a tight blockade and defamatory campaigns, will continue its cooperation programmes with African, Caribbean and other third world nations as part of the effort to reverse the consequences of the slave trade and other sad chapters in the history of colonialism and neo-colonialism. Since 1961, Cuba has provided cooperation to 154 countries. In our cooperation programmes, more than 270,000 civilian volunteers have provided services, mainly in the areas of health care and education.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk01-pa11">We Cubans will continue to study and preserve the legacy of those who, despite hard labour on the sugar and coffee plantations, left us their language, their religious beliefs, their music and temperament and their spirit of struggle for independence and sovereignty, and who changed us forever.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Edrees</span> <span class="nation">Egypt</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I should like at the outset to thank the members of the Caribbean Community for introducing the draft resolution adopted in the last session (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-19.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/19</a>) to commemorate 25 March 2007 as the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. I also wish to thank them for their initiative at the present session to make that date an annual international occasion to honour the memory of the victims of slavery throughout the world and to teach the lessons learned from the transatlantic slave trade and the dangers of racism and discrimination.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa02">As history shows, the practices of the era of slavery resulted in the loss of approximately 3 million lives during the journey across the Atlantic -- the infamous "middle passage" -- in utterly inhumane circumstances, while the 12 million who survived fell captive to servitude and racism. For generations -- in the New World indeed, to this very day -- the historic injustice visited upon the innocent has caused social and psychological problems for their descendants, not to mention racial prejudices that still hinder the ability of some societies to progress and to attain total integration.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa03">Undoubtedly, the African continent has borne the greatest burden, having been deprived throughout long centuries of its finest youth and having suffered from the continuous and illegal exploitation of its natural resources. Moreover, such exploitation is organically linked to the fuelling of armed conflict and the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons, thereby contributing to instability, poverty, endemic diseases and marginalization in the global economy that many of the African countries are facing today.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa04">These conditions have inhibited the ability of the African countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the year 2015, especially when developed countries' repeated pledges, action plans and partnerships aimed at helping Africa to realize its economic aspirations -- such as the commitment to set aside 0.7 per cent of their gross national income for developmental assistance -- remain unfulfilled.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa05">Regrettably, because of the scourge of slavery, humanity has suffered a myriad of social ills that were too often related to colour, race, belief or religion. Despite the international community's sincere efforts to implement the Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, despite the steps taken to follow up on the Durban Declaration of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, and despite the progress made towards achieving the universality of the various international covenants on human rights, we still witness the expansion of new forms of slavery and racism. These include forced labour, mandatory recruitment in armed conflicts, human trafficking and sexual exploitation, as well as incitement to xenophobia and religious defamation.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa06">Clearly, this situation runs counter to the world's growing need to rely on the diversity of civilization, culture and religion to heal the wounds that arose from this dreadful era in human history and to promote understanding, tolerance and the achievement of the common interests of different societies, regardless of their background.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa07">In order to respond to these serious negative phenomena, the international community must redouble its efforts to eliminate the modern effects of historical racial slavery, namely xenophobia and religious prejudice, as it seeks to consolidate the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. These objectives should be pursued in a spirit of cooperation, mutual respect and commitment to the principle of equal rights and obligations, not to mention the principles of international law and the complementarity of international humanitarian law and international human rights law.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa08">Accordingly, as we prepare for the upcoming Durban Review Conference in 2009, we must work on strengthening the complementarity of standards contained in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. These steps should be taken in order to restore the faltering trust between the countries of the North and South in the area of racial discrimination. Also required are intensified efforts to develop international machinery for controlling and combating human trafficking and other new forms of slavery, and to encourage States to enact national legal frameworks for curbing the growth of new racist trends. This should be accomplished through enhanced dialogue, mutual understanding and enlightened education, within a framework of partnership and cooperation among non-governmental organizations, the private sector and the wide spectrum of civil society.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa09">Moreover, at the same time, we must deal with the issue of migration in a comprehensive and serious manner by, inter alia, placing migrants' rights on an equal footing with those of other citizens in the receiving countries and by curbing discrimination and racism. Our attempt to encourage freedom of the media should also be matched by prohibiting attacks on the religions, prophets and cultural characteristics of the faithful of other religions. Clear-cut boundaries should be established between freedom of expression as enshrined in international instruments and national legislation, on the one hand, and infringement on the freedom of belief, on the other hand. In this way, we can achieve our goal of eliminating racism and hatred based on religion, origin, ethnicity or culture.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa10">It is high time that, through vigorous international action, we confront the proliferation of racism and discrimination of every stripe and from any source. Furthermore, while intensifying its efforts to comprehensively and seriously eliminate the scourge of racism, the international community must strive to maintain the necessary balance between the rights and the duties adopted and proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa02">Under the terms of operative paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would decide</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk02-pa03">"to designate 25 March as an annual International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, beginning in 2008, as a complement to the existing United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition",</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa04">and would request the Secretary-General,</p>
	<blockquote id="pg024-bk02-pa05">"in collaboration with and building upon the work undertaken by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, including its Slave Route Project, to establish a programme of educational outreach to mobilize, inter alia, educational institutions and civil society on the subject of remembering the transatlantic slave trade and slavery, in order to inculcate future generations with the causes, consequences and lessons of the transatlantic slave trade and to communicate the dangers of racism and prejudice".</blockquote>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa06">Pursuant to operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution, it is envisaged that various public information activities would be undertaken, including online dissemination of information relating to the current anti-slavery efforts and other materials in the six official languages of the United Nations, and exhibits at the various United Nations information centres. Should the General Assembly adopt <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.32.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.32</a>, it is estimated that the implementation of operative paragraph 4 would involve additional public information resources in the total amount of $43,800 under section 27, Public Information, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk02-pa07">Although provisions have not been included under section 27, "Public information", of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, to implement the activities as envisaged under paragraph 4 of the draft resolution, it is anticipated that the requirements could be met from within the resources proposed under that section for the biennium 2008-2009. Accordingly, no additional appropriations will be required.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Pierce</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk05-pa01">With your permission, Sir, I should like to make a general statement.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk05-pa02">The United Kingdom welcomes the adoption of the resolution on the permanent memorial to and remembrance of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. It is fitting that, as we close the year marking the two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, the General Assembly once again acknowledges the horrors of slavery and the slave trade. We have a duty to ensure that those horrors and their victims are never forgotten.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk05-pa03">For that reason, my Government warmly welcomes the initiative of the Caribbean Community to establish a permanent memorial to the victims of the transatlantic slave trade at the United Nations. The United Kingdom has already pledged to support the memorial, and I should like to take this opportunity today to encourage others to do likewise.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk05-pa04">The United Kingdom Government Minister Margaret Hodge said last week that "understanding the slave trade and its legacy is vital to broadening our history and recognition of the challenges we still face as a society today". Through the resolution adopted today, the United Nations gains a dedicated day each year to remember the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. That will provide us all with an opportunity in future years not only to remember those victims, but also to remind ourselves of the lessons of tolerance, respect and human dignity that the victims of slavery throughout the ages have taught us all and the lessons we can also learn from the campaign for the abolition of the slave trade. I should like in that context also to highlight the issue of human trafficking, which so tragically persists today.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk05-pa05">Those lessons, as the resolution points out, will complement the work done by UNESCO. They are enshrined in the UNESCO International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, which takes place on 23 August each year. As part of the United Kingdom Government's own commitment to that work in this bicentenary year, we have announced that in future years national activities to remember the valuable lessons of the bicentenary will be held to coincide with the UNESCO Day. We are committed to ensuring that the educational, cultural and historical focus of this bicentenary year is carried forward in the future, just as we are committed to remembering the victims of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery throughout the ages with the international community each year on 25 March.</p>

	<p id="pg026-bk04-pa01"> I now give the floor to the representative of Guyana to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.35</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg026-bk05">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Talbot</span> <span class="nation">Guyana</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa01">The delegation of Guyana welcomes the consideration of agenda item 50, "The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order".</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa02">The new global human order is concerned with a human development dilemma -- in an era of unprecedented global prosperity and expanded opportunity, billions of people face poverty and despair, bypassed by the benefits of globalization. It is concerned also with the growing disparities between rich and poor, among and within countries, and about what that means for human development and the fulfilment of the Charter objective of higher standards of life in larger freedom. Those are challenges that we believe must be addressed if we are to create a global environment in which people everywhere are better placed to develop their potential and to contribute to their societies and to the achievement of progress worldwide.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa03">Those considerations inspired Guyana's formal submission of the proposal for a new global human order in the General Assembly seven years ago. The submission coincided, interestingly, with the adoption of the Millennium Declaration. The latter event signalled a renewed global commitment to the implementation of the development agenda and the restoration of core issues of development cooperation to the heart of the United Nations work in the twenty-first century.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa04">In the period that has elapsed, global events and trends of particular consequence to the realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have given cause for reflection and concern. Today, at the midpoint of the 2015 calendar, despite appreciable gains in some areas, the prospects for attainment of the MDGs remain uncertain, with many countries falling behind on several of the goals, human development indicators falling in key areas and the already deep gap in inequalities and inequities widening. These developments attest to the increased need for initiatives such as the new global human order in the quest for a world free from want.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa05">In the context of a globalized world, increased interdependence is axiomatic and the necessity for intensified international cooperation  imperative. Despite the expanded opportunities and the growing prosperity occasioned by globalization, increasing inequality among and within countries is a regrettable feature of the contemporary global order. The full benefits of globalization must be harnessed for all. Otherwise, vulnerable economies will be exposed to the risks of devastation, social and economic disparities will be further widened, and the promise of greater prosperity, peace and security and the enjoyment of human rights will remain unfulfilled for many of the world's people.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa06">The new global human order aims at providing a framework for integrating different aspects of development -- economic, environmental, social, cultural and political -- through a holistic approach linking disparate but related initiatives and proposals. Premised on partnership, interdependence and people-centred development, it aims at expanding common ground and advancing practical measures for effective and coherent implementation of international development policy.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa07">In this regard, particular attention, we believe, needs to be paid to the following issues. New and additional resources for development need to be mobilized. There needs to be greater coherence in international economic cooperation, including through the strengthening of the United Nations so that it can play a more dynamic role, as envisaged by the Charter. Implementation of the commitments emanating from United Nations global conferences needs to be enhanced. The democratization of global institutions also needs to be enhanced. A fairer global trading regime to accelerate global growth needs to be promoted, thereby allowing for a more equitable distribution of benefits. And finally, military expenditures need to be reduced in favour of greater investment in human development.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa08">It is Guyana's view that the magnitude and complexity of the development challenge points to the need for a qualitatively different approach to international cooperation that takes into account the recognized shortcomings of previous global strategies. Today, consensus-building, enhanced cooperation among all relevant actors and multilateral solutions to common problems are more vital than ever. The United Nations Charter mandates the Organization to address political, security, economic, social, cultural and humanitarian issues in a holistic manner, bearing in mind their recognized interrelationships. A key challenge in this regard would be to address global disparities in a comprehensive and sustainable manner.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa09">Let me say a few words in introduction of the draft resolution that is before the Assembly, entitled "The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order", contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/L.35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa10">In the preambular part of the draft resolution, the Assembly, among other things, would recognize that the well-being of people and the full development of their potential is pivotal to sustainable development and would express its deep concern about the growing disparities between rich and poor and about the adverse implications thereof for the promotion of human development throughout the world. In recognizing the action under way and the progress made to implement the internationally agreed development goals, including the MDGs, the Assembly would also recognize that the achievement of many of these goals is currently off track and that vigorous implementation of all development commitments will be needed to achieve the goals.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa11">In the operative part, the Assembly stresses the need for a broad-based consensus for action within a comprehensive and holistic framework towards the achievement of the goals of development and poverty eradication involving all actors, namely Governments, the United Nations system and other international organizations and relevant actors of civil society, including the private sector and non-governmental organizations.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa12">It notes with interest the proposal regarding a new global human order, recognizes that inequality within and among countries is a concern for all countries regardless of their level of development and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session a report on the implementation of the resolution and to include in that report an assessment of the implications of increasing inequality for development, peace, stability and international economic cooperation.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa13">In conclusion, my delegation takes this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to delegations for the flexibility and spirit of accommodation shown throughout the many informal consultations held on this draft resolution, which have led us to the result before us today. We offer special thanks to the delegations that have joined in sponsoring this text.</p>
	<p id="pg026-bk05-pa14">It is now my honour to commend <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.35</a> to the General Assembly for adoption by consensus.</p>

We do this to express our support for the draft resolution entitled "The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order", contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/L.35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa02">On the basis of the mandate of the Turkeyen Summit, the States members of the Rio Group undertook to support initiatives aimed at promoting a new kind of human and social development within a more just and equitable economic order. We recognize the central importance of the United Nations to augment multilateral actions that can place the human being at the centre of all proposals for development. We reiterate the need to implement social and economic policies that are aimed at bringing about harmonious and comprehensive development based on equality, social justice, increased well-being and the eradication of poverty.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa03">We support the improvement and the strengthening of international commitments on development, particularly those that identify programmes that aim to provide financial and technical assistance, training of human resources and transfers of technology to smaller economies and the least developed countries in the international system.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa04">We believe that the goals of the Millennium Summit relating to economic development and the eradication of poverty have certainly seen significant progress over the last few years. However, we still have much to do in order to eliminate the growing disparities between rich and poor and to guarantee to present and future generations economic and social development that will gather pace in an environment of peace and social justice.</p>
	<p id="pg027-bk01-pa05">Finally, we consider that addressing major issues facing humankind -- such as the protection of the environment, health, the protection of human rights and education -- cannot fail to help create a world where human development is fully guaranteed.</p>

	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to address the Assembly today on behalf of the States members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on agenda item 50, "The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order".</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa02">CARICOM member States are united in support of the call for a new global human order and welcome the consideration of this item by the General Assembly. Our countries also support and have sponsored the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">document A/62/L.35</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa03">Despite the greater integration of markets and expanded opportunities for prosperity which globalization has brought for some, the contemporary world order is marked by growing inequality in the distribution of its benefits. Disparities between rich and poor continue to increase both among and within countries. Unfulfilled commitments from international conferences and summits, increased environmental vulnerability and new threats to peace and development underline the urgency of alternative approaches to ensure human development in a globalized world.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa04">We believe that the proposal of a new global human order speaks to the need for a qualitatively different approach to development, one which addresses these realities and takes account of the shortcomings of previous global strategies. We believe that the concept of a new global human order offers a framework for integrating the economic, environmental, social, cultural and political aspects of development and for linking disparate but related initiatives and proposals. Premised on partnership, interdependence, people-centred development and a holistic approach, it aims at defining common ground and advancing practical measures for effective and coherent implementation of international development policy.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa05">It is CARICOM's view that the operationalization of such an approach to development can best be undertaken under the auspices of a global body such as the United Nations. The Organization is well placed by virtue of its overarching role in the promotion of international economic and social progress. In addition, the underlying objective of the new global human order could provide a sound platform not only for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, but also for the promotion of development over the long term.</p>
	<p id="pg028-bk01-pa06">We call on Members of the United Nations to give careful consideration to the proposal of a new global human order and to lend their valuable support to <a href="../pdf/A-62-L.35.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/62/L.35</a>, on "The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order".</p>
