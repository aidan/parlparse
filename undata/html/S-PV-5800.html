	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01"> The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Following consultations among the members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Baabda on 12 December 2007, which killed General François el-Hajj of the Lebanese Armed Forces and killed and injured several other persons.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"It expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, to the Lebanese Armed Forces and to the Government of Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council expresses its strong condemnation of this attempt to destabilize Lebanese institutions, in this particular case the Lebanese Armed Forces.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council reiterates its condemnation of all targeted assassinations of Lebanese leaders, particularly since October 2004, and demands an immediate end of the use of intimidation and violence against the representatives of the Lebanese people and institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"It stresses that it is of the highest importance that the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this heinous crime are brought to justice and expresses its determination to support the efforts and commitment of the Government of Lebanon to this end.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council recalls its support for the Secretary-General's efforts for the establishment of the special tribunal for Lebanon in a timely manner, as a means to put an end to impunity in Lebanon and deter further assassinations in Lebanon.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"It underlines that no attempt to destabilize Lebanon should prevent the holding, without delay, of a free and fair presidential election in conformity with Lebanese constitutional rules, without any foreign interference or influence, and with full respect for democratic institutions.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council emphasizes the importance of the unity of all the Lebanese people. It also reiterates its full support for all ongoing efforts in Lebanon to combat terrorism, solidify democratic institutions, engage in political dialogue and pursue national reconciliation."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2007-47.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2007/47</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</p>
