	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa01">The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa02">Members of the Council have before them the report of the Secretary-General on the situation in the Central African Republic and the activities of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central African Republic, <a href="../pdf/S-2005-414.pdf" class="pdf">document S/2005/414</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa03">Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa04">"The Security Council heard a briefing by the Representative of the Secretary-General, General Lamine Cissé, on the situation in the Central African Republic and the activities of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA). It reiterated its full support for the action of the Representative of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa05">"The Security Council is deeply gratified by the successful holding of the presidential and legislative elections, and welcomes the establishment of the newly elected institutions whose stability is necessary to ensure lasting peace in the Central African Republic.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa06">"The Security Council acknowledges the efforts by the Central African defence and security forces to guarantee satisfactory security conditions during the electoral process, and commends the Multinational Force of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (FOMUC), France, the European Union, China and Germany for providing decisive support to them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa07">"The Security Council appreciates the vital role played in the process by FOMUC to date, and expresses its support for continuing efforts by FOMUC to back the consolidation of the constitutional order, which has thus been re-established, and the rebuilding of the rule of law. In this regard, it welcomes the decision of the States of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community to extend the mandate of FOMUC.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa08">"The Security Council invites the Government of the Central African Republic, and all the political and social forces, to consolidate the national dialogue and to ensure national reconciliation with a view to achieving sustainable development in their country.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa09">"The Security Council calls upon international donors and the international financial institutions to continue to assist the Central African Republic generously. It emphasizes that their support will be indispensable for the country's economic and social recovery and encourages them to formulate, in close consultation with the United Nations system and the Government of the Central African Republic, a concerted development strategy.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa10">"The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to explore, in close consultation with the authorities of the Central African Republic and the country's development partners, the possibility of setting up a follow-up committee or enlarging the Committee of Foreign Partners to Follow Up on the Electoral Process in order to support the reconstruction efforts initiated by the Central Africans. It invites the Secretary-General to report to it on his consultations through his Representative in the Central African Republic, no later than 31 October 2005.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa11">"The Security Council expresses its concern at the insecurity reigning in the north and the west of the country owing to the presence of armed groups in these regions, and invites relevant States to consult with subregional and regional organizations and with BONUCA on the action required to respond collectively to the threat posed by these armed groups to the stability of the Central African Republic and certain countries of the subregion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa12">"The Security Council expresses also its deep concern at the continued deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Central African Republic, in particular in the north of the country. It calls upon the international community to contribute generously to the humanitarian needs of the Central African Republic."</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk07-pa13">This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol <a href="../pdf/S-PRST-2005-35.pdf" class="pdf">S/PRST/2005/35</a>.</p>
