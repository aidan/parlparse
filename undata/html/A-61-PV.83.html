	<p id="pg001-bk04-pa50">Also, Madam President, may I take this opportunity to thank you most sincerely and to also express our thanks to the Chairperson, Her Excellency Mrs. Tiina Intelmann of Estonia, as well as the Vice-Chairmen, Mr. Benedicto Fonseca Filho of Brazil, Mr. Prayono Atiyanto of Indonesia and Mr. Aboubacar Sadikh Barry of Senegal, for their extraordinary collaboration and partnership during this most challenging and successful session of the Second Committee.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01"> I thank the Rapporteur of the Second Committee. If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of the Second Committee which are before the Assembly today.</p>

	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">Statements will therefore be limited to explanations of vote. The positions of delegations regarding the recommendations of the Second Committee have been made clear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant official records. May I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, the General Assembly agreed that</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">"When the same draft resolution is considered in a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in plenary meeting unless that delegation's vote in plenary meeting is different from its vote in the Committee."</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa03">May I remind delegations that, also in accordance with General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-RES-34-401.pdf" class="nolink">decision 34/401</a>, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from their seats.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa04">Before we begin to take action on the recommendations contained in the reports of the Second Committee, I should like to advise representatives that we are going to proceed to take decisions in the same manner as was done in the Second Committee, unless the secretariat is notified otherwise in advance. That means that where recorded votes or separate votes were taken, we will do the same. I also hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote those recommendations that were adopted without a vote in the Second Committee.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa05">The Assembly is reminded that shortly we will be taking action on draft resolutions recommended for adoption by the Second Committee and as such, those draft resolutions can no longer be additionally co-sponsored in plenary by Member States.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa06">Any corrections delegations may have concerning the reports of the Second Committee, including the listing of sponsors of a draft resolution contained in the reports of the Committee, should be submitted to the secretariat of the Second Committee for the issuance of corrigenda.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa07">Before proceeding further, I wish to draw the attention of members to a note by the secretariat distributed desk to desk. The note will serve as a reference guide for action on draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the Second Committee in its report. Members will find in column 6 of the note the numbers of the draft resolutions or decisions for action in the plenary, with the corresponding numbers of draft resolutions or decisions of the Second Committee in column 3 of the same note.</p>

	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">At the plenary meeting of the Second Committee on 8 December, my delegation requested a separate vote on this resolution. This time we did not call for a separate vote, but voted in favour of the resolution. However, Japan still has reservations about the structure of operative paragraph 10, which relates to the institutional linkage between the United Nations and the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Global warming is an urgent challenge, and the UNFCCC is one of the most important forums we have for international negotiation and action. The environment is one of the pillars of the work of the United Nations. To ensure urgent and effective action in this area, the knowledge and experience of this Organization should be put to full use in the activities of the UNFCCC.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">That said, the UNFCCC is an independent treaty body with its own budget and secretariat, which now consists of more than two hundred staff members. The Government of Japan has consistently maintained that the United Nations should not be called on to shoulder the expenses of the UNFCCC. My delegation believes that starting with the 2008-2009 biennial budget the UNFCCC should assume full responsibility for its complement of service-related costs.</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk04-pa02">As revised, paragraph 12 should read as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk04-pa03">"Encourages the promotion of dialogue among the media from all cultures and civilizations, emphasizes that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, and reaffirms that the exercise of this right carries with it special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and necessary for the respect of the rights or reputations of others, the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or morals;".</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk04-pa04">The second revision is to operative paragraph 14 of the draft resolution. The final words of paragraph 14 should be deleted; the paragraph as revised should read as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg017-bk04-pa05">"Decides to convene in 2007 a high-level dialogue on interreligious and intercultural cooperation for the promotion of tolerance, understanding and universal respect on matters of freedom of religion or belief and cultural diversity, in coordination with other similar initiatives in this area;".</p>

	<p id="pg017-bk06-pa06">Should the General Assembly adopt the draft resolution, no additional conference servicing resources and no public information coverage would be required, as it is understood that the high-level dialogue referred to in paragraph 14 of the draft resolution would be part of the work of the General Assembly, and would be held within the context of its plenary meetings, which are budgeted and provided for throughout the year. Since the exact requirements of the high-level dialogue have yet to be specified, any additional conference servicing requirements for related activities, such as parallel meetings of the General Assembly, round tables, hearings and panels, will be evaluated and submitted to the Assembly at a later stage, once the format and modalities of the high-level dialogue have been determined.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg018-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Jokinen</span> <span class="nation">Finland</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, the candidate countries Turkey and Croatia, the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania and Serbia and the European Free Trade Association countries Iceland and Liechtenstein, members of the European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and Moldova, align themselves with this declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa02">Tolerance is one of the core values of the European Union, as reflected in the motto "United in diversity" and in our laws and policies. It is our firm belief that tolerance and the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms are key to relieving sensitivities and finding durable solutions to the tensions that sometimes surge in that regard. The European Union sees dialogue as an essential tool for laying firm foundations for mutual understanding and tolerance across religious and cultural lines.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa03">The European Union highly appreciates the intensive consultations that took place this year between us and the main sponsors of this resolution. The active exchange of views helped to bring about some, although not all, of the desired improvements in the wording of the resolution, thus strengthening its consensual basis. Owing to our genuine commitment to the underlying tenet of this resolution, the European Union joined the consensus on its adoption. We would, however, like to take this opportunity to underline the main principles that guide our understanding of the resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa04">It is the European Union's firm belief that the protection and promotion of all human rights and fundamental freedoms are central to our efforts to strengthen interreligious and intercultural dialogue, and that genuine mutual understanding can be built only on full respect for individual dignity and integrity.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa05">The European Union wishes to emphasize once again the paramount importance of the freedom of expression in the conduct of such dialogue. We are deeply convinced that a fruitful and genuine dialogue cannot be guided by Government authorities; it needs to be rooted in free and spontaneous participation in public debate reflecting a variety of opinions. In that regard, we are pleased to note that operative paragraph 12 of this resolution is fully in line with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa06">The European Union attaches great importance to the various United Nations initiatives aimed at enhancing dialogue and mutual understanding. Moreover, we would like to pay special tribute to the work conducted within the framework of the initiative for an Alliance of Civilizations. Just a couple of days ago, we heard the Secretary-General give his broad support to the implementation of the recommendations laid down in the report of the High-level Group. It is our understanding that, in order to most effectively move forward the agenda of dialogue and tolerance, these initiatives should be carried out in a coordinated, coherent and complementary manner, and with appropriate follow-up.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa07">In line with that approach, we therefore welcome the aim of coordinated and coherent follow-up within the United Nations system, as outlined in paragraph 16 of the resolution. However, when it comes to the concrete organization of the work of the United Nations Secretariat, the European Union fully trusts the Secretary-General to propose the most appropriate ways and means to that end, within the existing institutional framework.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa08">In the same spirit, we welcome the decision, reflected in paragraph 14 of the resolution, to closely coordinate the planned high-level dialogue with other comparable initiatives so as to ensure due visibility and centrality of the debate. Also, the need for an international year for interreligious and intercultural dialogue needs to be carefully assessed against the background of other ongoing initiatives, such as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of the World and the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, and with due regard for the guidelines for establishing international years.</p>
	<p id="pg018-bk04-pa09">It is with that understanding that the European Union joined the consensus on this resolution.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg019-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Miller</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa01">The United States was founded on the principle of freedom of religion. Our pluralism of religions and a strong tradition of open dialogue have promoted tolerance and the growth and vitality of our society for over 400 years.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa02">The text just adopted has much to recommend it. It acknowledges the importance of religious and cultural diversity and affirms that mutual understanding and dialogue are important for achieving a true and lasting peace. It recognizes the importance of education, and it recognizes the vital role of the media, whose ability to work freely and objectively is crucial to open and honest dialogue, even when the news that they report is unpleasant or critical.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa03">We appreciate the sponsors' agreement to modify operative paragraph 12 to reflect exactly the language in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We are still disappointed, however, that the resolution highlights limitations on freedom of expression. We believe that in a resolution on interreligious dialogue and in a paragraph on the media, highlighting restrictions on speech creates a potentially chilling effect. We are greatly troubled by the potential for arbitrary, Government-imposed restrictions in these areas, where tolerance and diversity are vitally important.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa04">Our joining the consensus on this resolution as regards paragraph 12 is predicated upon the declaration made by the United States on article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and upon United States constitutional provisions concerning freedom of expression. We do not wish to fetter freedom of expression, particularly in the context of interreligious and intercultural dialogue; such dialogue can be effective only when it is completely open and free. We must be able to engage in an open exchange of views without fear of recrimination if we are to truly develop the understanding and trust necessary to get along and live with one another.</p>
	<p id="pg019-bk01-pa05">Regarding paragraph 14, we understand that the provisions called for will not give rise to additional financial implications. We wish to note that the United States delegation also generally opposes any intersessional departures that would add to or alter the calendar of conferences and meetings or that would give rise to additional financial implications.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Erciyes</span> <span class="nation">Turkey</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg020-bk05-pa01">Turkey voted against <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-222.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/222</a>, which is entitled "Oceans and the law of the sea" and which was submitted under sub-item (a) of agenda item 71. My delegation would like to underline that the reasons that prevented Turkey from becoming a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea remain valid. Turkey supports international efforts to establish a regime of the sea that is based on the principle of equity and that can be acceptable to all States. However, in our opinion, the Convention does not make adequate provision  for special geographic situations. As a consequence, it is not able to establish an acceptable balance between conflicting interests. Furthermore, the Convention makes no provision for registering reservations on specific clauses.</p>
	<p id="pg020-bk05-pa02">Although Turkey agrees with the Convention in its general intent, and agrees with most of its provisions, it is unable to become a party to it because of those serious shortcomings. That being the case, Turkey could not support the resolution, which also calls upon States to become parties to the Convention and to harmonize their national legislation with its provisions.</p>

	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa01">My delegation would like to refer to <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-222.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/222</a>, which was introduced under sub-item (a) of agenda item 71, entitled "Oceans and the law of the sea" and which has just been adopted by Assembly.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa02">In that regard, the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would like to reiterate its commitment to cooperate with efforts aimed at promoting coordination on issues pertaining to oceans and the law of the sea, in keeping with international law but without reference to any particular convention.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa03">In this connection, we would like to repeat what we said during the informal consultative process that took place in February 2006 and during the recently concluded informal consultations: the reasons that prevented Venezuela from becoming a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea remain valid. It is for that reason that my delegation was not in a position to join other States in support of the resolution as a whole, as Venezuela is not a party to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Nor are we bound by the provisions of the Convention under customary international law, with the exception of those provisions that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has, or will have, explicitly recognized by incorporating them into our national legislation.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa04">My delegation would therefore like to reiterate its long-standing position with regard to United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as some of the provisions of today's resolution led my delegation to abstain in the voting. Nevertheless, my delegation would like to note that Venezuela supports section X of the resolution, which pertains to marine biodiversity, as it allows States not parties to the Convention to participate in the discussions to be held by the United Nations with regard to marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdictions. Venezuela believes the Convention on Biological Diversity to be a framework instrument for the regulation, conservation and use of biological diversity on all fronts.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk01-pa05">In that regard, we would like once again to thank delegations for their understanding during the informal consultations, as well as to reiterate our thanks for their support. We believe that it is through negotiation and understanding that consensus can be achieved, and that universality is achieved by marshalling will. Section X of the resolution just adopted by the Assembly is an example of that.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg021-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Nworgu</span> <span class="nation">Nigeria</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa01">As a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Nigeria believes that the international community has been well served by the provisions of the Convention, including those governing the rights of passage of vessels on the high seas and straits, consistent with international law. That has ensured navigational safety without compromising environmental concerns over pollution.</p>
	<p id="pg021-bk02-pa02">Nigeria is satisfied that the occasional disputes that have arisen between States parties on the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea have been immediately resolved within the ambit of international law. Nigeria recalls that, during the last meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization, held last October in London, the principle of the right of passage was again reaffirmed by the majority of participants, including Nigeria. The fact is that, unless that principle is affirmed and protected, the freedom of movement of vessels, and especially transit passage, would be set back. Nigeria does not therefore subscribe to interpretations of the Convention that are inconsistent with its spirit and letter. Nigeria therefore reiterates its support for paragraphs 65 to 67 of resolution we have just adopted, and rejects unilateral measures, howsoever conceived by States, that run counter to the letter and spirit of article 42 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and thereby jeopardize the multilateral cooperation envisaged in the Convention.</p>

	<p id="pg022-bk03-pa02">I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.43</a>.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Tarrag</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa01">On behalf of the member States of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) -- Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe and Timor-Leste -- I have the honour to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.43</a>, entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Community of Portuguese-peaking Countries", under sub-item (f) of agenda item 108. I would also like to mention that the following countries have joined as co-sponsors of the draft resolution: Argentina, Chile, the Czech Republic, the Gambia, Mauritius, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonian and Zambia.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa02">The CPLP brings together 240 million people in eight countries and four continents. Its members are active participants in various forums of the United Nations. The CPLP also includes members of important groupings or organizations, such as the African Union, the Common Market of the South, the European Union, the Organization of American States, the Southern African Development Community and the Association of South-East Asian Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa03">One of the objectives of the Community is to expand cooperation among its members by means of concerted political and diplomatic actions, including in the context of international organizations, so as to give ever greater expression to their common interests and needs. Another important goal that we actively pursue is the intensification of bilateral and plurilateral cooperation among member States, especially in areas such as health, education, agriculture, public administration and technology.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa04">As a dynamic organization, the CPLP has been involved in many initiatives since its establishment -- such as fighting HIV/AIDS in its five African member States; the organization of the conference on malaria that took place in Sao Tome and Principe; the establishment at Luanda, Angola, of a centre for the development of entrepreneurial skills; the establishment in Maputo, Mozambique, of a centre for the development of public administration; and the establishment of a centre of official languages in Timor-Leste to consolidate the use of Portuguese and Tetum.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa05">On the political front, the CPLP has been actively involved in Guinea-Bissau to help in the electoral process. It has also been in contact with international financial institutions in order to obtain funding for an emergency project in support of institutional rebuilding in that country. In Timor-Leste the CPLP is involved in rebuilding the country's justice and public administration systems.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa06">The draft resolution I have the honour to introduce today on behalf of the CPLP members stresses the progress achieved in the area of cooperation between the CPLP and United Nations agencies and other bodies and programmes, in particular UNESCO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Labour Organization. That cooperation has been helpful in the implementation of programmes and in developing partnerships with projects aimed at fighting hunger and poverty, as well as HIV/AIDS, in CPLP countries. That action demonstrates the engagement of the CPLP in multilateral initiatives of the United Nations in the context of the implementation of the Millennium Declaration.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa07">Both individually and collectively, members of the CPLP are committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as set out in the CPLP's Constitutive Declaration and Statutes. In that context, on 9 November 2006, we signed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights an agreement regarding consultation, exchange of information and technical cooperation on activities in the field of human rights. Draft resolution <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.43.pdf" class="pdf">A/61/L.43</a> has as its main feature, in the operative part, an invitation to the Secretary-General to continue to undertake consultations with the Executive Secretary of the Community, with a view to promoting cooperation between the two secretariats, as well as to start consultations for the establishment of a formal cooperation agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa08">Members of CPLP would greatly appreciate it if the draft resolution could be considered with the following three corrections.</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa09">The fourth preambular paragraph should read as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa10">"Welcoming the participation of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries in the Seventh High-level Meeting between the United Nations and Regional and Other Intergovernmental Organizations, held in New York on 22 September 2006,".</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa11">The fifth preambular paragraph should read as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa12">"Recalling the celebration by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the first time of the Portuguese Language Day on 5 May 2006,".</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa13">The third correction is to operative paragraph 2, which should read as follows:</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa14">"Welcomes the signature on 9 November 2006 of the agreement between the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries regarding consultation, exchange of information and technical cooperation on their respective activities in the field of human rights;".</p>
	<p id="pg022-bk04-pa15">On behalf of the States members of the CPLP, I wish to express our gratitude to those countries that joined in sponsoring the draft resolution, which we hope can meet with the approval of the General Assembly.</p>

	<p id="pg023-bk01-pa01">I now give the floor to the representative of the Netherlands to introduce <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.49.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.49</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg023-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Majoor</span> <span class="nation">Netherlands</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa01">It is my honour and pleasure to introduce to the General Assembly <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.49.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.49</a>, on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). I hope that the draft resolution will shortly be adopted by consensus.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa02">The primary objective of the biennial draft resolutions on this item is to highlight the importance of continued cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an organization that is coming closer and closer to matching the universality of the United Nations, with a current membership of 180 countries. The task of completing its full universalization still requires special efforts by all stakeholders. The adoption of this draft resolution will provide the basis for the General Assembly's continued consideration of cooperation between the United Nations and the OPCW at its sixty-third session.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa03">There can be no doubt that one of the key objectives of the United Nations, namely, a safer world for all, is greatly enhanced by the OPCW's activities in the areas of non-proliferation, protection and assistance to member States in the destruction of chemical stockpiles, as well as international cooperation in the peaceful uses of chemistry. The OPCW's activities, which are often undertaken in cooperation with regional organizations, remain as valid today as when the organization was established 10 years ago, including those aimed at addressing new threats such as international terrorism, on which the General Assembly has recently adopted an important Strategy (<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-288.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/288</a>).</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa04">It is against that background that the Netherlands, as initiator of this draft resolution and at the request of the OPCW, has included a reference to the upcoming celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the establishment of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. That important event will be celebrated in The Hague, the Netherlands, on 9 May 2007, with the unveiling by Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands of a permanent memorial to all victims of chemical weapons. It goes without saying that the OPCW is aiming for appropriate political representation as a strong message of member-State support for the OPCW's mission to finally free the world from the dangers of chemical weapons through the total elimination of these cruel instruments of death.</p>
	<p id="pg023-bk02-pa05">Let me close by warmly thanking all Member States, including those that have sponsored this draft resolution. Their support is most valuable and highly appreciated. It is a pleasure to see that, as with the membership of the OPCW, the number of sponsors has also continued to grow, as we now have over 70 sponsors today, compared to 50 last year.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Ms. Lazouras</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa01">I have the honour to introduce, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the draft resolution entitled "World Diabetes Day", which is contained in <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.39-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/61/L.39/Rev.1</a>.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa02">Diabetes is a silent epidemic that has immense human, social and economic costs. It spares no nation, and the threat it is beginning to pose to development is growing. More than 240 million people around the world now live with diabetes, which kills over 3.5 million people each year. An additional 7 million are falling victim every year. Furthermore, diabetes entails innumerable related diseases and conditions.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa03">Despite the growing numbers and the threat to life and well-being, its full dimension and impact remain unrecognized, in particular in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization projects that, without remedial action, diabetes deaths will increase by more than 50 per cent over the next 10 year. Most notable, diabetes deaths are predicted to increase by over 80 per cent in upper-middle-income countries between 2006 and 2015.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa04">We are of the view that a General Assembly resolution on diabetes would strengthen awareness and facilitate immediate global action in addressing this pandemic. In that regard, by <a href="../pdf/A-61-L.39-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/61/L.39/Rev.1</a> the Assembly would decide that the current World Diabetes Day -- 14 November -- be designated as United Nations World Diabetes Day, to be observed every year beginning in 2007. The draft resolution encourages Member States to establish national policies focusing on the prevention, treatment and care of diabetes, in line with their health-care systems. Furthermore, Member States as well as other stakeholders are invited to observe the Day in an appropriate manner, in order to raise public awareness on diabetes and related complications, including through education and the mass media.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa05">Diabetes is incurable, but its management is within human reach. With good awareness, discipline and moderation in diet and lifestyle, affected people can lead normal lives. A United Nations Day will significantly contribute to awareness-building and draw the attention of the international community to the need for effective measures for the management, treatment and care of diabetes. We hope that this draft resolution will be adopted by consensus. We would also like to thank all the countries that sponsored the draft resolution.</p>
	<p id="pg024-bk09-pa06">Before we take action on the draft resolution, I would like to make one correction to the first preambular paragraph. The words "<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-265.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/265</a> of 30 June 2006" should be replaced by the words "<a href="../pdf/A-RES-60-35.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 60/35</a> of 30 November 2005".</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chowdhury</span> <span class="nation">Bangladesh</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa01">The Bangladesh delegation most warmly thanks all those who joined in the unanimous adoption of <a href="../pdf/A-RES-61-225.pdf" class="pdf">resolution 61/225</a>. That adoption attests to the fact that the entirety of the membership can be united in combating any threat or possible threat to humankind. That is in consonance with the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter enjoins us to cooperate for the betterment of humanity in the social, cultural and economic spheres.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa02">A united front against diabetes is an example of that. We have now joined the cause to fight it. It is a quiet cause, for diabetes is a quiet killer. Statistics demonstrate that 246 million people around the world are now victims. It is emerging as a major public health challenge of the twenty-first century. Least developed countries, of which my country is one, do not have the wherewithal to confront this burgeoning menace. Indeed, unless we are able to alleviate poverty and reduce the incidence of debilitating diseases like diabetes, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals will remain for most of us a consummation devoutly to be wished.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa03">Bangladesh views the United Nations as a tool for change and an instrument to help create a global community where peace and stability may reign, where conditions are appropriate for development, where the environment is protected and where poverty and disease are drastically reduced. We will not achieve the changes we seek tomorrow, or the day after, but eventually. We must continue to work towards them with dedication, diligence and patience. That is why Bangladesh champions causes at the United Nations -- not lost causes but noble ones -- and, often, as in this case, quiet ones.</p>
	<p id="pg025-bk04-pa04">We fervently believe that this resolution is a milestone achievement. It is now our shared responsibility to pursue multilateral efforts to raise public awareness about diabetes and related complications, as well as to ensure prevention, treatment and care. We can fail to do so only at the cost of great peril to the humankind.</p>
