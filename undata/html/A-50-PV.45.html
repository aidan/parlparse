	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa02">The Assembly has before it <a href="../pdf/A-50-209.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/209</a>, which contains the nominations by the Economic and Social Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee which will occur as a result of the expiration on 31 December 1995 of the terms of office of China, Egypt, Japan, Kenya, Nicaragua, the Republic of Korea and Togo. Those States are eligible for immediate re-election.</p>
	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa03">I should like to remind members that after 1 January 1996 the following States will still be members of the Committee: Argentina, Bahamas, Belarus, Benin, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Comoros, Congo, Cuba, France, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Romania, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America.

	<p id="pg001-bk08-pa04">The following States have been nominated by the Economic and Social Council: three African States for three vacancies -- Egypt, Togo and Zaire; three Asian States for three vacancies -- China, Japan and the Republic of Korea; and one Latin American and Caribbean State for one vacancy -- Uruguay.</p>

	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa01">I have the honour to introduce, on behalf of the sponsor countries, the draft resolution contained in <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.7-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">document A/50/L.7/Rev.1</a>, entitled "Mission of the United Nations in El Salvador".</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa02">After years of violence and uncertainty, El Salvador has now reached the stage of consolidating the peace process, building and strengthening political, economic and social institutions and improving structures for harnessing, through dialogue and reason, the pluralism and differences inherent in all contemporary societies.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa03">With the support of the United Nations, Salvadorans carried out an intensive negotiating process that culminated in the signing of the Peace Agreement at Chapultepec. At that time the stage of implementation and verification was initiated, with the assistance of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) from 1991 to 1995 and, as of 1 May 1995, with that of the Mission of the United Nations in El Salvador (MINUSAL).</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa04">The draft resolution before the Assembly makes reference to the most recent resolutions and reports relating to the situation in El Salvador. It recognizes with satisfaction the continuing evolution of El Salvador into a democratic and peaceful nation. It also acknowledges the contributions made by Member States for the functioning of the Mission. The draft resolution welcomes the continued commitment of the Government and the people of El Salvador to the consolidation of the peace process. It praises the work done by MINUSAL and the Secretary-General. It recognizes the political commitment of the Government of El Salvador and other parties to complete the implementation of the agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa05">On that basis, the draft resolution approves the Secretary-General's proposal to extend MINUSAL's mandate, with a gradual reduction of its strength and costs in a manner compatible with the efficient performance of its functions. Finally, it calls on Member States and international institutions to continue to provide El Salvador with assistance and support in the consolidation of peace and development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk05-pa06">The sponsors of <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.7-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.7/Rev.1</a> are convinced that its adoption would demonstrate the international community's renewed commitment to peace, stability and development in El Salvador. We are confident that the Assembly will give the draft resolution its full support, and we strongly recommend that it be adopted.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">The European Union has taken note of the report (<a href="../pdf/A-50-517.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/517</a>) of the Secretary-General of 6 October 1995 on El Salvador and, in particular, on the role of the new Mission of the United Nations in El Salvador (MINUSAL).</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa03">The mediation process, the determination of the parties and the commitment to peace of the people of El Salvador, assisted by the presence of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) and the work of the Group of Friends, made it possible to put an end to the bloody civil conflict in El Salvador. This historic success was enshrined in the Chapultepec agreements of January 1992. During the past few years, we have witnessed with satisfaction the transition in El Salvador from a conflict situation to one of peace and reconciliation.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa04">Today the population of El Salvador as a whole is deeply involved in the process of normalizing the country's political life, which will make it possible to lay the foundations of a stable democracy in a climate of peace and development.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa05">The European Union congratulates the Government of El Salvador and the other political forces in the country for the progress achieved in complying with the provisions of the Chapultepec peace agreements and the recommendations of the Commission on the Truth.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa06">El Salvador must continue to receive assistance from the international community. The presence of MINUSAL since 1 May 1995 -- first under the leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Enrique ter Horst, whose work we wish to praise, and now under that of Mr. Ricardo Vigil -- has enabled the United Nations to continue to exercise its good offices and has helped inspire confidence in the ongoing process of consolidating progress through the strengthening of El Salvador's democratic institutions as well as in the full implementation of the peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa07">The European Union supports MINUSAL's presence in El Salvador, which contributes effectively to overcoming the obstacles still in the way of the full implementation of the peace agreements. It therefore agrees with the Secretary-General's proposal -- included in the draft resolution (<a href="../pdf/A-50-L.7-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/L.7/Rev.1</a>) before us, which was just introduced by the representative of Mexico -- to extend MINUSAL's mandate for six months, with a gradual reduction of its strength and costs in a manner compatible with the effective performance of its duties.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa08">We consider this necessary, not only because of the important and encouraging political message this decision will send to El Salvador, but also because we are concerned that some aspects of the peace agreements are not being fully implemented and others have been subject to considerable delays. Swifter progress is needed in order to avoid weakening the peace process and causing political and social instability.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa09">The European Union wishes to stress the importance of implementing reforms in the judicial system, in particular the legislative reforms required for the implementation of the binding recommendations of the Commission on the Truth, as well as in the electoral sphere and in the human-settlement and land-transfer programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa10">Furthermore, the increase in delinquency, especially the organized kind, and the deterioration of public security are elements of concern. Efforts to counter delinquency must be made in conjunction with the institutional development of the National Civil Police and the National Public Security Academy. The concept of a national civil police force, as embodied in the peace agreements, must be preserved and sustained. To this end, the European Union is providing technical and financial assistance to these mechanisms.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa11">The draft resolution which the General Assembly has before it today, and which we trust will be adopted by consensus, clearly shows the political will of the international community to consolidate the recent achievements of the people of El Salvador through the full implementation of the peace agreements.</p>

</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk03">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Castaneda</span> <span class="nation">El Salvador</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa01">The development of events in Central America has been considered by the Security Council and, in particular, the General Assembly since 1983, when the agenda item entitled &quot;The situation in Central America: threats to international peace and security and peace initiatives&quot; was introduced and more directly since the signing of the Esquipulas II agreements in 1987 and the commitments adopted at the El Salvador Summit in February 1989, when our Governments agreed to ask the United Nations to take the necessary steps to put into operation a mechanism for the verification of the commitments aimed at securing a political solution to the regional crisis. This then took the form of various initiatives which were developed in the field and which led to progress in the peace process, thus moving us away from confrontation and towards efforts to consolidate a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa02">The initiatives aimed at finding a political solution to the armed conflict in El Salvador were also taken in their context. We should recall that in December 1990 both the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí para Liberación Nacional (FMLN) asked the Secretary-General to exercise his good offices in the search for peace. His participation in the negotiations was then formally established in the Geneva agreement of 4 April 1990.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa03">Since then, negotiations have been held with the assistance and good offices of the Secretary-General, directly or through his Special Representative. This launched the widest possible process for the maintenance of peace in Central America, and a mechanism was introduced to monitor implementation of the agreements resulting from the negotiations -- the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL), initially with the limited task of verifying the San José Agreement on Human Rights of July 1990, and then with the more extensive task of verifying implementation of the peace agreements of January 1992 which ended the armed conflict, and subsequently to begin the consolidation of peace and democratization, thereby achieving national reconciliation and the integral development of our country in an atmosphere of full respect for human rights.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa04">As we are all aware, the implementation of the peace agreements and the progress made to that end were the basis for ending ONUSAL's mandate. However, it was also felt that a reduced United Nations presence should be maintained to continue observing and verifying the implementation of pending commitments.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa05">To that end, once ONUSAL's mandate terminated, in April 1995, provision was made for the new Mission of the United Nations in El Salvador (MINUSAL), which came into operation as of 1 May 1995, to continue the verification functions and exercise its good offices until there is full implementation of the peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa06">In respect of the pending commitments, I believe it is appropriate to remind this Assembly that in October 1995 we reached an agreement between the political parties and other competent institutions making it possible to appoint the Inspector General of the new National Civil Police, in accordance with the peace agreements. We have also continued to implement the land transfer programme and the programme to reintegrate former combatants from both parties into the civilian and institutional life of our country, thereby demonstrating the concern and firm political will of the Government of El Salvador fully to comply with the commitments in the peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa07">It should be pointed out, in relation to the strengthening of the National Civil Police, that MINUSAL requested the President of the Republic to evaluate the present situation of public security in our country. The request also contained a proposal and recommendations for improvements in this area, which also shows the work being done and the level of confidence that has been earned by MINUSAL.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa08">The process of transforming El Salvador's society from a semi-authoritarian and semi-democratic political system into a modern democratic political system with full respect for the human, political, social, civil and economic rights of all members of our society has been a national effort for the most part, but it would not have been possible to achieve this in the time in which we have done so without the good offices of the Secretary-General as an intermediary, the resolute support of the entire United Nations system, and the cooperation and timely solidarity of the international community. We therefore would like again to express our great appreciation and gratitude.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk03-pa09">We are pleased that the Assembly has now adopted <a href="../pdf/A-50-L.7-Rev.1.pdf" class="pdf">draft resolution A/50/L.7/Rev.1</a> by consensus because this confirms the commitment by the United Nations to the consolidation of peace and democratization in El Salvador, and to continued support by the international community for the efforts made by our people and our Government to achieve a future of peace and prosperity for all Salvadorans.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kaskarelis</span> <span class="nation">Greece</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa01">Last Friday, the representative of Spain delivered a statement on behalf of the European Union. Greece fully subscribes to the contents of that statement. I would like, however, to elaborate on some issues which are of particular interest to my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa02">The year 2000 lies ahead of us. To be young and live at the end of the twentieth century is to witness a process of constant change all over the world and, at the same time, to encounter a cruelly competitive cultural, social, economic and political reality.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa03">On the other hand, Governments responsible for the realization of a youth policy in their respective countries are well aware that youth problems have nowadays escaped the narrow geographical borders of their States. Problems tend to be common to all young people on the planet.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa04">In this framework, the concluding triptych of strategies of the 1985 International Youth Year: Participation, Development, Peace, still remains critical and needs urgent implementation through both national and international programmes.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa05">In a world witnessing rapid socio-economic change and a deepening of the differences between developed and developing countries, the most affected part of the population is youth, or "the forgotten quarter", as it is described by UNICEF. It is this part of the population which not only reflects the problems of contemporary societies but also projects the image of the future world. Therefore, it is by addressing the concerns, the needs, the desires and the dreams of the youth of today that we will build a safer and healthier world for tomorrow.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa06">There should be a specific approach to addressing the specific problems of the youth population. Measures should be taken to combat increased juvenile delinquency, drug abuse and youth marginalization. Urgent measures are also needed against female infanticide, sale of children and organs, child prostitution, child pornography and all forms of sexual abuse. New policies should be introduced to protect working children from exploitation and hazardous conditions that endanger their physical and mental development.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa07">The lack of adequate opportunities for education, training and employment and poor facilities and services are factors which can fuel social exclusion and marginalization; therefore they should be eliminated.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa08">Youth, being more vulnerable to disadvantages from which our society is suffering, should be especially protected in priority areas such as health services, nutrition, education, safe water and adequate sanitation.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa09">In a world of increased tensions and multiplying points of conflict, special care should be taken to protect and assist children in war areas and to rehabilitate children traumatized by war and natural disasters.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa10">Specific programmes should be studied and effectuated in order to combine efforts for a better environment with endeavours for a better future for our children, to whom this future mostly belongs.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa11">We join our voice to that of other countries in the world, for: active cooperation between governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations; strengthening of ties between Member States of the United Nations, in the knowledge that it is only through solidarity that we can resolve pressing problems facing youth all over the world; urgent, universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; universal signature of the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children and the Plan of Action adopted by the World Summit for Children, as well as its effective implementation; and intensification of the role of non-governmental organizations in the effective implementation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa12">We salute the United Nations initiative of dedicating meetings of the General Assembly's fiftieth session to commemorating the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year, and we are certain that this endeavour will result in many fruitful proposals concerning youth.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk04-pa13">It is only by meeting young people's needs and aspirations that we can ensure a better future for all of us.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg006-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Butler</span> <span class="nation">Australia</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa01">Last week the General Assembly convened in special meetings to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Those meetings saw the largest gathering of Heads of State and Government ever held. The past was reviewed but, more important, the focus was on the future.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa02">It is deeply appropriate that as our first action thereafter we celebrate the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year, because it is the youth of today who will carry us into the next half-century of the United Nations and beyond.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa03">While there is much to do at the local and national levels, it is also vital that we address the issues of youth at the international level. There is also much we must do globally to improve the situation of youth. They have an important role to play at the international level. Youth themselves are at the forefront of the ongoing process of the globalization of our world. Youth everywhere must be encouraged to expand their links in international cooperation and communication.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa04">We have a responsibility to create an enabling environment in which our best resources can flourish. We need to create a world for youth characterized by equality of opportunity, freedom from hunger and poverty, freedom from violence and discrimination in all its forms, and freedom from the threats of environmental degradation and nuclear weapons. These issues are of great concern to the youth of Australia, as they are to those of other countries. And we must increasingly act together to address the specific problems of youth related to health, employment, drug abuse and delinquency -- issues addressed in the World Programme of Action for Youth.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa05">We can only be successful in meeting these challenges by including the contributions of youth in building and designing their futures and providing them with the opportunity to participate and express themselves freely.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa06">The challenges the world faces today are clearly different from those we faced 10 years ago, at the time of International Youth Year. The recent major conferences and summits of the United Nations in the areas of women, social development, human rights, population, environment and development among others, have gone a long way towards gathering momentum and identifying actions to address those issues. The resulting programmes and platforms for action have as much, if not more, relevance for today's youth as they do for all others. It is imperative that we now fulfil our commitments made at those conferences by taking action. The draft World Programme of Action for Youth is an important adjunct to the framework of future activities set out in the outcomes of those recent major conferences. In our work to implement those outcomes we must continue to bear in mind the importance of youth.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa07">The World Programme of Action on Youth must also be a part of our national policies on youth. As expressed in the World Programme, it is important that Governments formulate and adopt national youth policies, as a means of addressing youth-related concerns.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa08">Australia's youth social justice strategy was introduced to provide a special focus on youth in the Government's broader social justice strategy, which aims at developing a fairer, more prosperous and just society for all and is directed at expanding choices and opportunities to permit full participation in society, and to enable all to determine the direction of their own lives.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa09">Australian Government policy focuses primarily on the provision of assistance and support to all young people in relation to employment, education and training, financial assistance, housing, health and a number of other issues specifically impacting upon young people.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa10">Principal features of Australia's youth policies are: the youth training initiative, which aims to assist early school-leavers through an early intervention strategy and by providing access to case management; labour market programmes and a youth training allowance for unemployed 15- to 17-year-olds; Austudy, which aims to provide the financial assistance necessary for young people attempting to exercise their right to an education; pilot programmes targeting young people who are homeless or at risk of becoming so; and special pilot projects designed to establish best practice in youth suicide prevention.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa11">We are now one year into the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People and it is our hope that the activities of the Decade will have a particular impact on improving the situation of the world's indigenous youth. A high proportion of Australia's aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are young. By the start of the 1990s, the median age for our aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was under 20 years of age, compared with over 30 years of age for the Australian population as a whole. This indicates that the heaviest burden of the disadvantages faced by our indigenous population are borne by its youth. The legacy of past injustices is still evident in disturbing indicators of poor health, lower educational and employment status, and disproportionately high levels of incarceration.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa12">The Australian Government is comprehensively seeking to address the situation of its indigenous youth across a range of processes and programmes, including specific strategies in the areas of education, health services, in particular for the homeless, employment and training, sport and recreation, and youth access. We consider that the International Decade provides an additional framework for our own strong national efforts within which to achieve measurable and sustainable progress in partnership with our indigenous communities.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk02-pa13">That is the central reality -- partnership. It is only in partnership with our youth that we can hope to achieve real progress in realizing the goals of International Youth Year: the goals of participation, development and peace, and a better society for all toward the year 2000 and beyond.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the representative of South Africa.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Mofokeng</span> <span class="nation">South Africa</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">It is with boundless joy that the South African delegation addresses this special session of the General Assembly commemorating the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The youth in my country epitomize change and liberty. The Government of National Unity declared 16 June as a "Day of the Youth". That day symbolizes the uprising of the youth against the evil system of apartheid, which was found in my country. It was on the occasion of celebrating that day that President Mandela announced the establishment of the President's Children Fund -- a trust fund aimed at providing poverty-stricken and street children with resources that will ameliorate, if not annihilate, their miseries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">Many Ministries of the Government of National Unity have appointed youth sector representatives to advise and oversee efforts aimed at youth empowerment. Last November youth delegates from all corners of my country assembled at the behest of the Government of National Unity. The object of that meeting was to give young men and women a chance to shape the Government's approach to youth matters. For the first time in the history of policy-making in South Africa, the Government met with youth representatives from the political organizations, non-governmental organizations, youth clubs, student organizations and other bodies.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">The Government was told that each and every programme aimed at youth empowerment must be underscored by the principle of youth centrality. Aptly put, youth must be involved in all the stages leading towards, and after, the adoption of such policies and programmes -- that is, during the consultation, design and implementation periods.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Most developing countries are faced with a multiplicity of socio-economic problems that result in unemployment, lack of vocational skills, illiteracy, economic stagnation, and other difficulties. Although these problems affect all sectors of the population, young men and women are the most hard hit.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">It is our sincere belief that if there is to be any intervention, it should aim at addressing all these problems simultaneously, in a systematic and realistic manner. Furthermore, my Government has taken a conscious decision to target youth and women as the primary beneficiaries of its reconstruction and development programme. Already youth are conspicuous in their participation in various projects, not only as beneficiaries but also as policy-makers and managers.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">It is worth noting that in many countries there are still structural limitations, within different socio-economic formations, inhibiting youth development, such as obsolete values, policies and regulations. Governments must open avenues for young people so that they can participate fully in every aspect of life.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa08">To the young men and women of the world my delegation would like to say that identifying problems is one element in solving them. The other part is seizing the initiative by rising above the problems. Correctly put, it is high time for young men and women to take their rightful place in the struggle against problems that affect humanity -- whether women's issues, drugs, environmental issues, sustainable development, or any other matter. We need to see cooperation between young people in developing countries and between young people from developing and from developed countries.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa09">It is said that the youth are the leaders of tomorrow, but often they are never given a chance to occupy meaningful positions today to prepare themselves to lead their respective communities. Let the youth give meaning to these words by preparing to lead their communities.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The Acting President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the representative of Andorra.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Minoves-Triquell</span> <span class="nation">Andorra</span> <span class="language">French</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">I have the pleasure and the great honour of being the youngest ambassador and permanent representative accredited to the United Nations. It is therefore natural that I should speak today in this General Assembly meeting to commemorate the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year. Moreover, this is an opportunity that the Principality of Andorra holds dear for many reasons. First, Andorra is a country with an age pyramid rather different from those of the other States of Western Europe. The ratio of young people in the total population is much greater in our country than in neighbouring States. We are therefore well aware of the problems and challenges facing youth today. Secondly, the Principality of Andorra is the author of one of the commitments of the Heads of State and Government included in the Final Declaration of the Summit for Social Development, held in Copenhagen in March this year:</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">"[We heads of State and Government will] encourage the contribution of people of all age groups as equally and vitally important for the building of a harmonious society, and foster dialogue between generations in all parts of society". (<a href="../pdf/A-CONF.166-9.pdf" class="nolink">A/CONF.166/9</a>, paras. 25 and 29, <i>Commitment 4(h)</i>)</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">This commitment encompasses all generations. One might think that something that is open to everyone concerns no one. To the contrary, we in the Principality of Andorra believe that it is extremely useful to appraise the question of youth as part of a multi-generational whole. The world of human beings is a dialogue between individuals and between groups of individuals -- groups determined by people's liking for one cause or another. There is therefore dialogue between rich and poor, between one ethnic group and another, between architects and engineers, or between any other groups of human beings.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">However, one of the oldest dialogues between groups of people is that between generations -- the transmission of wisdom and accumulated knowledge between the old and the young. The human race has developed through dialogue between generations. Although this must be preserved, we must prevent it from becoming a monologue, for, while what our ancestors pass on to us is wisdom, roots and knowledge, it is possible to contribute to the perpetuation of errors.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Indeed, at a time when young people are killing each other in Bosnia and other places -- when, after decades of shared life, new generations are massacring each other on the pretext of past religious or other grudges -- the indications are that dialogue between generations has not worked, that young people have not used their ability as human beings to understand, analyse and say no to the irrational struggles that have been inculcated by their elders.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">Young people must be given every opportunity to distinguish between kindness and cruelty, between the rational and the irrational, between good and evil, following the logic of tolerance and freedom of the individual. This can be achieved only through education. It is therefore essential that the education systems of our world communicate the message of peace and tolerance. Young men and young women, despite their individual characteristics, are very impressionable beings -- some more so than others -- and are therefore especially susceptible to ideologies and fanaticism, both in terms of their capacity to absorb information and by way of imitation.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">If we want the generations of the third millennium to be worthy of being called "human", it is imperative that the United Nations continue its efforts in the field of education, through the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other worthy bodies. Today, at the end of the twentieth century, we are well placed to want thoughtful education which will communicate to the young the values of the past but will also enable them to guard against the mistakes of those who have gone before them and give pride of place to reason and tolerance.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">Since I am speaking about tolerance, in this anniversary year dedicated to tolerance, I should like to recall some words of my Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Manuel Mas Ribo, a few weeks ago in the general debate:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg008-bk02-pa09">"Tolerance is limited only by intolerance." (<i>Official Records of the General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings, 14th meeting, p. 15</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">Far too many young people are today victims of intolerance. By virtue of the colour of their skin or their birth, sex, religion, views or any other condition arising from their personal or social situation, they are unable to explore their freedom as individuals or enjoy the possibilities that life offers. We must see to it that an end is put to discrimination, especially the most insidious type of discrimination -- that which comes from the nearest sources and which often drives young people to desperate action or, when there is no other motivation, to suicide. In fact, in the case of young people, suicide is always an indication of the failure of society to integrate them.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">Although it is true that all the ills to which I have just referred affect other age groups too, it should not be forgotten that if we could manage to check them among young people we should avoid their repetition in the future.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">So far, I have referred to what is needed to enable young people to reach their full human potential -- that is, the sum total of the values of tolerance and reason which their education must provide and which is therefore our concern. In addition, young people must be able to make constructive use in society of what they have learnt. This is something that can be imparted to them only up to a certain point; they must themselves make the effort to become part of society and not to despair.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa13">Several weeks ago, in the Third Committee, I commented that the Principality of Andorra is very concerned about unemployment, which is dragging these new generations towards the abyss of poverty and absence of social integration, to drugs and crime, because opportunities are lacking. We note with concern the statistics showing that the lack of work is affecting young people more tragically than other age groups. In the developing countries the total labour force has increased by more than 400 million units since the 1960s, and during this decade it will increase by 2.3 per cent annually, necessitating the creation of 260 million new jobs. As we have noted several times, this is a fantastic challenge, but also one of frightening magnitude.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa14">Dialogue between the generations must be re-established so that young job-seekers do not push out their elders who have already benefited from the integration of work. There will probably be a need to juggle work schedules or to create jobs with flexible hours so that workers can share the possibilities for employment. In any case, that is a question to which we will have to give active consideration.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa15">During the celebration of this fiftieth anniversary year, the Principality of Andorra has paid a great deal of attention to youth and children. In the first half of 1995, I visited a school in Harlem, PS 206, in order to share the message of the United Nations with young people of New York, the host city of our deliberations. A few weeks after that meeting, Ambassador Marrero of the United States and I opened this General Assembly Hall to those children to explain to them the purposes and possibilities of our Organization. In July, Andorra brought more than 50 young members of its national choir to United Nations Headquarters to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary through music. Later, in September, 10 young winners of the special prize of the National Committee for the Fiftieth Anniversary were invited to visit the United Nations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality also signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child during his stay in New York in early October. The Andorran Parliament will soon decide on its ratification.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa16">I have received instructions and the means to move forward, on behalf of my country, on the question of youth. Today, I assure the Assembly that this will happen. It is essential that the United Nations do all in its power to ensure that the ideals of the 1945 Charter, based on a concept of the human being endowed with freedom and reason, have real meaning for young people. The salvation of our planet depends on this.</p>

	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01"> I now call on the representative of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Samhan</span> <span class="nation">United Arab Emirates</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">On behalf of the State of the United Arab Emirates, I am pleased to participate in this special meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year, which coincides with the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. That coincidence imbues the occasion with greater impetus and prospects for carrying out a review and assessment of the policies that have been adopted on the issue of youth at the national, regional and international levels.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">The 10 years that have passed since the proclamation, in 1985, of the International Youth Year have witnessed many speedy economic, political, social and cultural developments which have impacted on all human communities and, in particular, the young, who number over 1 billion of the world's inhabitants. Eighty-four per cent of those young people live in the developing countries, which suffer from hunger, poverty, unemployment, backwardness, political instability and lack of security. These negative phenomena have been reflected in the delinquency, violence and extremism which afflict the societies of those developing countries, and which have created difficult problems that cannot be contained unless we fully understand the problems of the young, their aspirations and the important role they could play in the various spheres of international life. We live in an age that requires us to innovate and to be creative in a manner that should be inspired by our common values and the shared sense of responsibility towards our present and future generations.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">A few days ago, our Heads of State and Government met in this very Hall to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. In the Declaration adopted on that occasion, they pledged to:</p>
	<blockquote id="pg009-bk02-pa04">"give to the twenty-first century a United Nations equipped, financed and structured to serve effectively the peoples in whose name it was established" (<i><a href="../pdf/A-50-48.pdf" class="pdf">A/50/48</a>, p. 2</i>)</blockquote>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">in the fields of peace, development, equality and justice. We feel that none of this could be achieved unless we accord the highest priority to youth as principal partners in this endeavour and as the cultural bridge between past, present and future generations. While the international community realizes that the young, with all their affiliations and cultural backgrounds are the principal human resource in the area of economic development and the effective element of social change and scientific creativity, we feel an increasing anxiety towards the lot of youth, especially in the countries of the developing world, where economic and social circumstances deprive them of the opportunities for training, education, employment, basic social services and health care. This leads to the emigration by large numbers of youth to more developed or wealthier countries, in search of better job opportunities, higher standards and decent living. This has created clear imbalances in many communities, limited the possibilities of utilizing the environment and has thus widened the economic and social gap between the developed and the developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">The leaders of the world -- who recently committed themselves here to participate effectively in reforming and restructuring of the programmes and institutions of the United Nations, in strengthening its objectives, and in reorienting its policies, in serving the world's peoples, especially in the developing countries, have agreed that efforts should be deployed and steps should be taken towards rehabilitating and educating the young and responding to their needs. For the most part, these young people have been used and exploited as tools of war, armed conflicts, violence, terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime. Because the young are the makers, beneficiaries and victims of social and economic changes, it has become extremely important to evolve the necessary mechanisms and the sound comprehensive international approach to help support and improve the situation of youth, especially in the poorer communities. In so doing, consideration must be taken of cultural and social diversity, the religious teachings, customs and traditions of each country, and the needs of every society in the areas of peace, security and sustainable development.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">Proceeding from its belief that its youth are its real wealth and the mainstay of its present and future, and in response to the call by our Head of State, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates has always accorded a high priority, in formulating its development policies, to the question of youth through the promulgation of legislation and the provision of the basic requirements for putting in place the best possible education curricula, health and social programmes, free of charge, as a service to the sons of our country, in line with our national systems and regional and international policies. At the same time, we have striven to preserve the specific nature of our local community, which derives its teachings from the tolerant <i>sharia </i>of Islam and the traditions of our society.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">In the field of education, my country has made a number of qualitative and quantitative achievements, by putting in place comprehensive educational policies at all levels, from primary education to university and post-graduate levels.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa09">Furthermore, we have always made a point of providing all health care services while improving their quality. We have also established many cultural and sports clubs and recreational centres. We have provided the most advanced facilities for the disabled and for rehabilitation of delinquent youth. We have focused on improving the situation of "underprivileged families" healthwise, economically and socially. We have also sought to create job opportunities for the youth of such families and have enabled them to take part in various missions abroad. We provide several types of assistance and support to many activities aimed at benefiting the young in many developing countries.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa10">The major challenges that face today's world and in particular those that face the young, who shoulder the burden of preserving and developing the present and building the future, make it incumbent on the international community to work for the achievement of peace, progress and prosperity for all peoples by trying to pre-empt conflicts and improving the means of finding peaceful solutions to current conflicts in consonance with the United Nations Charter and the provisions of international law.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa11">We must also make a great effort to combat poverty, backwardness, social and economic problems and alleviate the burden of debt, in order for the developing countries to mobilize the capabilities of their youth and, thereby, to allow them to participate fully in the development process. This requires the United Nations to develop and update its programmes for youth which constitute the practical steps that enhance their participation in the building of peace, security and stability and in fostering the coexistence of the world's countries.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mrs. Klein-Loebman Tobing</span> <span class="nation">Suriname</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">I wish, on behalf of my delegation, to take this opportunity during the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of International Youth Year to add the voice of our youth to the useful contributions we have heard so far. I am very impressed with the statements young people have made at these special commemorative meetings, in which they have urged their respective Governments and the international community to involve youth when it comes to matters of development regarding youth so that the main theme of International Youth Year -- "Participation, Development and Peace" -- can become a reality. These young representatives, who are the future of their countries, of our countries, are right, and they deserve to be commended for their impressive messages.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">In January 1995, the Government of Suriname established a tenth anniversary International Youth Year Committee, which selected as its main theme, "Improving the situation of youth by supporting their own initiatives".</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">Some of the activities of the Surinamese tenth-anniversary International Youth Year Committee so far have been the organization of a National Youth Consultative Meeting in June 1995 and the convening on 24 October 1995, United Nations Day, of a Youth Assembly, which focused on the problems of and solutions for crime, prostitution, child labour, education, youth and environment.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The delegation of the Republic of Suriname is of the view that we, the elders, must involve youth when it comes to the formulation of policies, programmes and decisions regarding them. My delegation would like to assure young people of our solidarity with their justified desire for full participation, development and peace.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">In this context, the draft World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond constitutes a sound basis and a good guideline for developing essential activities in the interest of youth in such areas as education, employment, poverty, health, environment, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency. Suriname's youth will gladly develop activities in these areas on the basis of this draft World Programme and, wherever possible and necessary, in close cooperation with youth from other parts of the world.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">We hereby appeal in particular to the representatives of donor countries and United Nations donor agencies to provide the necessary resources, because with their generous contributions youth can fulfil their essential and noble task of realizing peace, democracy and development for all peoples all over the world.</p>
