<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk10">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Guéhenno</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa01"> I will make this statement to the Security Council on behalf of the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa02">"Let me start by welcoming the Council's adoption of a resolution authorizing the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS). We look to UNMIS to play a key role in assisting the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, signed on 9 January between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa03">"This is a crucial moment for the Sudan, and a decisive one for the international community, in the resolution of decades of civil war in Africa's largest country. I am heartened that, after lengthy deliberations by the Council, the text takes into account proposals that I made in my January report.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa04">"Those proposals were based on a thorough analysis of what we believe is required from the international community to give effective support for the implementation of the Peace Agreements. Although there are some areas where the resolution does not match my recommendations, we in the Secretariat are prepared to fulfil our obligations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa05">"But let us be clear: the people of the Sudan, the donor community and the United Nations face extraordinary challenges in implementing the Peace Agreement. These must be addressed quickly and with determination. Serious political hurdles still confront the peace process, and we must have the full cooperation of the parties to overcome them.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa06">"Moreover, we will face unprecedented logistical obstacles in establishing a United Nations peace support operation in a country famous for its extreme climate and prohibitive terrain.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa07">"The United Nations is looking to members of the international community -- in particular those who have already generously supported the peace process and humanitarian relief -- to provide further sustained assistance in key areas. These include security sector reform; the return and reintegration of internally displaced persons; the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of combatants; and longer-term economic development.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa08">"Recovering from more than 20 years of civil war will be a lengthy and a costly process. Yet even the United Nations appeal for $560 million to cover immediate funding of relief and recovery in the south remains woefully underfunded, with only 10 per cent pledged or contributed so far.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa09">"Next month's meeting in Oslo will be an important test of our commitment. But we need immediate and generous support even before that -- especially with the approach of the rainy season, which threatens to impede our operations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa10">"The resolution that the Council has adopted today rightly expresses the Council's utmost concern over the dire consequences of the prolonged conflict in Darfur. I welcome the Council's explicit wish to reinforce efforts to foster peace in Darfur, especially through support by UNMIS for the African Union mission.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa11">"I have just received the preliminary report of the assessment mission led by the African Union, in which the United Nations also participated. I am studying the report and will hold urgent consultations with Chairperson Konaré before making recommendations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa12">"It is clear that the present state of affairs in Darfur is unacceptable; its problems are immediate, and we cannot accept the status quo. The violence and destruction must stop. Impunity must end. If security does not improve quickly, the killings and rapes will continue. We must not allow this catastrophic scenario to become a foregone conclusion.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa13">"We must make clear to those responsible that they will be held accountable. I support the Council's efforts to give this message real meaning. As members are aware, there is a clear recommendation from the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur that the Security Council immediately refer the situation to the International Criminal Court. Sanctions must also be kept on the table.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa14">"While I welcome today's resolution, I also look forward to the Council's decision on these issues.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa15">"As we meet here today, humanitarian workers and the African Union mission are on the front line of the international community's response to the Darfur crisis. They are working together courageously, with dedication and at great personal risk. The Council owes it to them to act with courage and determination.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk10-pa16">"Our work to help bring peace and stability to Sudan as a whole is still only beginning. For the sake of the men, women and children of that nation, let us all act firmly and decisively to complete our mission."</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa01">I thank Mr. Guéhenno for the statement.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk01-pa02">I now give the floor to the representative of the Sudan.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg003-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Erwa</span> <span class="nation">Sudan</span> <span class="language">Arabic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council at this very historic time for my country. We are fully confident that you will carry out your mission well.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa02">I begin my statement by thanking the Council for all its efforts to support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), which was reached on 9 January 2005 after a long period of negotiations in which the Sudan's position -- which has not changed -- was that peace will continue to be a strategic choice and that every possible sacrifice should be made to achieve it.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa03">Until we implement that historic Agreement aimed at ending one of Africa's longest conflicts and opening up the prospect of a unified Sudan in which peace prevails and in which the north, south, east and west live together in harmony; and until the Agreement takes effect throughout the Sudan, providing stability and peace, particularly in the Darfur province -- and we hope that events will continue to move in the right direction in that regard -- we must redouble our efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace by bringing about peace and stability in Darfur, as stated before the Council by the President of the Sudanese Republic and the leader of the SPLM/A on 8 February.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa04">Now that the Council has adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-1590(2005).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 1590 (2005)</a>, which sets out the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), I should like to thank in particular the resolution's sponsors for their rational approach in defining the Mission's mandate in a separate resolution. We fully appreciate the wisdom of the members of the Council and their cooperation aimed at ensuring the unanimous adoption of this resolution so very important and historic for Sudan.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa05">I should like to remind the Council of the pledges and commitments undertaken at the historic meeting held in Nairobi on 19 November 2004, including its commitment to accelerate the adoption of the resolution on the mission's mandate and its insistence that the parties conclude a peace agreement as agreed at Nairobi. The parties honoured their commitment and presented the Peace Agreement to the Sudanese people as a gift at the beginning of the new year, as we promised. The people of the Sudan expect the United Nations Mission in Sudan to support the peace. The beginning of the implementation of this Agreement, which we have witnessed today, is a very important first practical step in that regard.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa06">The Government of the Sudan, which has made every effort to reach peace, is more keen than any other party to implement the Agreement and translate it into reality in every province of the Sudan. Here, we should like to remind the Council that we are a State on the threshold of development and progress. We have achieved this peace after having followed a long and arduous path, and we are now preparing to assume a number of responsibilities and to work long and hard to form a government of national unity, to prepare to implement the Agreement, to undertake efforts in the areas of repatriation and reconstruction, and to work intensively to put an end to what has been happening in Darfur and to enable it to embark on the path of peace without delay.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa07">I must remind the Council of the importance of supporting my Government at a time when it is assuming all of these responsibilities. Needless to say, one cannot ask the Government to undertake such important responsibilities while at the same time weakening it or limiting its capacities. History is our witness.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa08">At the end of this historic meeting, I must commend the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Troika States and the IGAD Partners Forum, as well as the very important position taken by the sisterly State of Kenya. We also commend the efforts undertaken by the African Union under the leadership of Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="pg003-bk02-pa09">I wish to reiterate that the Government of the Sudan, which has made every sacrifice to reach this Agreement, is firmly committed to its implementation. We will continue to work towards that end, and we will not look back until the benefits of peace are felt throughout the Sudan.</p>
