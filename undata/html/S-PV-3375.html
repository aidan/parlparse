<div class="spoken" id="pg002-bk08">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Afonso</span> <span class="nation">Mozambique</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa01">My delegation is pleased to see you, Mr. President, at the helm of the Security Council during this month of historical significance for Africa in general and for the southern African region in particular. I have been privileged to work closely with you on numerous occasions, and I therefore have no doubt that your well-known academic and diplomatic qualifications and wide experience in domestic, African and international affairs will lead the Council's deliberations to a successful outcome. You can rest assured that my delegation will assist you in the discharge of your mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa02">I am aware of your imminent departure, in a few days, for our region - southern Africa - to witness the birth of a unified, united, democratic and non-racial South Africa. It is our firm belief that the progress made towards a political settlement to the long-lasting conflict in South Africa will greatly contribute to regional peace and stability and will encourage positive changes elsewhere on our continent.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa03">I wish to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand, for the excellent manner in which he performed his responsibilities so actively and effectively as President of the Security Council for the month of April. I would like to thank him very sincerely for the kind assistance he gave to me and my delegation during his tenure of office.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa04">I cannot fail to reiterate my country's deepest respect for the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for his continued commitment to the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security and for his commitment to the peace process in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa05">My delegation has carefully reviewed the Secretary-General's informative progress report on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-511.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/511</a>. As we approach the target date, our attention is now focused on what remains to be done in order to eliminate all obstacles to the full implementation of the provisions of the General Peace Agreement. We are pleased to note that important progress has been made in the right direction. In looking back at where we stood a few months ago, we find genuine reasons for hope.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa06">The entire Mozambican population warmly welcomed the decision by President Chissano establishing 27 and 28 October 1994 as the dates for the multi-party general elections. This announcement, I believe, constitutes one of the most important achievements of the peace process. It was preceded by the inauguration of and subsequent progress made by the National Elections Commission, which enabled the President to make this historic announcement. Similarly, other important steps have also taken place since the last meeting of the Council on this question two months ago. These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the commencement of demobilization of all forces, the swearing into office of the Joint High Command, the beginning of the training programme for the Mozambican Defence Force (FADM), and the appointment of judges for the Electoral Tribunal, both by our Supreme Court and by the Secretary-General.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa07">However, major issues related to the implementation of the General Peace Agreement are still outstanding and will require our utmost attention during the months ahead. The cantonment of forces has yet to be completed. In this regard, it is to be noted that as of 28 April 1994 out of a total of 64,118 Government soldiers 34,304 have already reported to the assembly areas. If one adds to this number the 14,480 troops to be demobilized <i>in situ</i>, one will note that only 14,334 Government soldiers have yet to report to the assembly areas. There is a strong determination on the part of the Government to bring the cantonment process to its full conclusion as soon as possible.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa08">During the period under review, out of 19,140 RENAMO combatants to be sent to the assembly areas 15,709 have already reported there. In addition to those figures, RENAMO has yet to provide the necessary figure on the number of its combatants to be demobilized <i>in situ</i>, which is estimated at about 4,000. We are still awaiting RENAMO's confirmation of this figure. Simple arithmetic shows that about 3,433 RENAMO combatants have yet to report to the assembly areas.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa09">Regarding demobilization, it should be noted that since the beginning of this process, the Government has enjoyed a substantial edge in the matter. As of 28 April 1994 the Government had demobilized 13,745 soldiers, while RENAMO had demobilized only 561 combatants, or about 3 per cent of those to be demobilized.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa10">I turn now to the issue of the formation of the new Mozambican Defence Force. Despite the progress made so far in this regard, it is obvious - six months before the holding of the general elections - that we are still far from overcoming the results of systematic delays and achieving the troop strength provided for under the General Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa11">This is an issue of critical importance in the creation of the appropriate environment leading to the holding of the general elections. Considering that even the 30,000 troops agreed upon in Rome are insufficient to perform fully their responsibilities in a country as big as Mozambique, in the presently difficult geopolitical context, we clearly come to the conclusion that any further reduction of this figure may seriously affect the ability of our country to defend itself.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa12">In this connection, I wish to underline that my Government, more than anybody, fully understands the need for the successful completion of the mandate of ONUMOZ and will do all in its power to ensure that this goal is attained. But, more than the success of ONUMOZ, what is at stake is peace, national reconciliation and democracy for our country and our people. For these reasons, we believe that it is necessary to concentrate our efforts on the creation of adequate conditions for the full implementation of the General Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa13">In this context, my Government is in favour of the principle of fixing a firm deadline for the cantonment and demobilization of forces, taking into account the objective realities in the field and the calendar for the formation of the Mozambican Defence Force and the electoral campaign. This requires that both the Government and RENAMO, together with ONUMOZ, work closely to achieve consensus on these critical issues.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa14">My Government very much welcomes the Council's call upon the parties - in the draft resolution - to respect fully their obligations under the Rome agreement and to allow unimpeded access to the country as a whole, in order to ensure free political and economic activity to all political parties. As a matter of fact, this call applies only to RENAMO and to nobody else, and it has been made increasingly by many political parties and members of the international community in Mozambique. We hope that RENAMO will heed this appeal. The nomination of RENAMO officials on 1 March as advisers to the provincial governors was intended precisely to facilitate the solution of this problem. As the Secretary-General's report underlines, this arrangement is one of the key steps in implementing administrative and territorial integration.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa15">We therefore regret that despite the appointment of RENAMO officials to work as advisers to the 10 provincial governors, six months before the holding of the general elections and less than a month from the beginning of voter registration, the issue of unhindered access to the whole territory of Mozambique has not yet been settled.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa16">In addition, my Government is particularly disturbed by the growing attempts to raise new issues, extraneous to the commitments under the General Peace Agreement. This is, as I have said, disturbing, to say the least, especially when it comes from RENAMO, a signatory to the Rome agreement which, as we all remember, took two years of protracted negotiations.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa17">We strongly believe that, as we come closer to the election date, we should strongly discourage the raising of extraneous issues which could ultimately undermine the full implementation of the General Peace Agreement and therefore lead to unforeseen consequences. It is my Government's assumption that RENAMO is fully aware of the kind of agreement it signed in Rome, its content and its final objective.</p>
	<p id="pg002-bk08-pa18">My Government would like to see the Council take a fresh look at these issues and adopt the necessary, adequate measures to galvanize and contribute to the full implementation of the Rome agreement by all parties. As our Secretary-General underlines in his report, despite all the challenging tasks ahead, the major political conditions for the timely completion of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique are in place. All that is necessary is to assist and encourage the parties to translate their political will into practical steps. On our part, we are prepared to proceed along this path.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa01"> I thank the representative of Mozambique for his very generous words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa02">It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put the draft resolution to the vote.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa03">There being no objection, it is so decided.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk01-pa04">I shall first call on those members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg004-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sardenberg</span> <span class="nation">Brazil</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa01">At the outset, I wish to congratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. Your task will not be simple at a time when this Council has an extremely busy schedule, with a number of complex issues to be considered. We are confident, none the less, that your proven diplomatic skills and outstanding qualities of leadership will guide us successfully throughout our deliberations. Please count on the unrestricted support of our delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa02">I should also like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand, for the high quality of his work as President of the Council during last month's deliberations in equally trying circumstances.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa03">I listened with great interest and attention to the statement that has just been made by the Permanent Representative of Mozambique, Ambassador Pedro Comissario Afonso, in which he detailed the achievements and the remaining difficulties, and also made some recommendations regarding the peace process in Mozambique. I was interested in his comments regarding the historic events now taking place in South Africa and about the beneficial contribution those events are likely to make to the stability of other parts of southern Africa.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa04">I would like to express gratitude to the Secretary-General for his very useful and informative report on the current situation in Mozambique, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-511.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/511</a>. Such a report confirms our basic perception that the overall situation in Mozambique is evolving encouragingly. The Secretary-General points out a number of recent positive developments in the quest for peace since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-898(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 898 (1994)</a> last February. Among the positive results of the ongoing peace process, I should like to mention in particular the announcement by President Joaquim Chissano that general elections will take place on 27 and 28 October this year; the inauguration of the National Elections Commission; and the establishment of its provincial offices.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa05">At the same time, it is worth recalling that the assembly and the mobilization of troops are under way, as are the undertakings for the formation of the new Mozambican Defence Force. All these facts reveal that there is tangible and timely progress towards the implementation of the General Peace Agreement between the Mozambican parties. Undoubtedly they all contribute to the successful implementation of the Rome accord and pave the way for a sustainable and lasting peace for a country to which Brazil is attached through ancestral, cultural and historical links.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa06">My Government would like to pay a special tribute to President Joaquim Chissano for his high political profile during the entire peace process. President Chissano's statesmanship has made possible not only the signing of the Rome accord but also its steady implementation. He has displayed the type of leadership and political wisdom capable of bringing in the other party in Mozambique and of opening a new era of peace and stability in a country which has been ravaged by war for so long. We trust that Mr. Dhlakama and RENAMO, the other party, will show the same political will and good faith in meeting the obligations to which they are committed under the General Peace Agreement.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa07">The peace process in Mozambique is at a crucial stage, and important elements of the Rome accord remain to be fully implemented. The support of the international community as a whole and the role of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) bringing the peace process forward cannot be over-emphasized.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa08">The role of ONUMOZ has been vital in the political and military areas, which are intrinsically interwoven. Since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-898(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 898 (1994)</a>, my delegation has been concerned over the possibility of the military component of ONUMOZ being curtailed, thus jeopardizing a peace process which, by all accounts, is very close to becoming a success story. The mere description of the operational activities carried out by the United Nations forces throughout Mozambique reveals their importance for the peace process. They range from the maintenance of security in the corridors, along highways and main roads, in airports and regional depots for weapons collected from both parties to the security of logistical installations.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa09">We fully share the Secretary-General's assessment that the drawdown in the infantry component is a cause for concern. The delegation of Brazil continues to hold the view that the reduction of that component of ONUMOZ is premature, as the demobilization of Mozambican troops is still in progress and the new Mozambican Defence Force is not yet fully operational. We have yet to be persuaded of the advisability of intended marginal savings as compared to the broader, and by far more important, objective of a successful peace settlement in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg004-bk02-pa10">The wording of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-898(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 898 (1994)</a> is very clear in establishing that no reduction in the force total of ONUMOZ will be undertaken if this prevents its mandate from being effectively discharged. It is clear from this comment that my delegation would have preferred a course of action different from the one envisaged in the present draft resolution. We will, none the less, vote in favour of the draft resolution for two basic reasons: on the one hand, because of our great interest in and commitment to the evolution of the political process in the sister country of Mozambique and, on the other, because this draft resolution renews the commitment of the international community to help Mozambique in its quest for peace and internal political stability.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of Brazil for the very kind words he addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg005-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Olhaye</span> <span class="nation">Djibouti</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa01">My delegation would like to take this opportunity to welcome you warmly, Sir, and congratulate you wholeheartedly on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month. We are certain that with your considerable experience and your rare and proven skills you will provide the leadership the Council needs during this important period.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa02">We should also like to express our appreciation for the very capable manner in which your predecessor as President, Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand, guided the Council during a very strenuous month. His calming presence and imperturbability served us well indeed.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa03">Although a number of procedural matters remain to be ironed out and some general agreements need to be transformed into concrete measures, it is encouraging to note the current evidence of progress in the Secretary-General's excellent report on Mozambique. Cantonment of troops from both sides has taken place, the surrender and storage of weapons is proceeding, demobilization is under way and the creation of the new Mozambican Armed Force was inaugurated in March.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa04">Bringing the new army up to prescribed manpower levels seems to be lagging well behind, which could have an impact on national security in the future. The problem appears to lie in the Government's financial resources, which may not be sufficient to offer a rewarding career choice to potential recruits. This problem has held up demobilization and may mean that projected Mozambican Defence Force and demobilization targets will not be met as required.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa05">Though these contingencies could have served as a pretext to delay the peace process and the elections, it is most encouraging to see that this has not been the case. The Government has officially announced the forthcoming election dates of 27 and 28 October 1994 and, along with RENAMO, has agreed that these dates will hold despite any delay in meeting the Mozambican Defence Force size requirements. The fact that there have been no military activities that posed a serious threat to the cease-fire or the peace process as a whole underscores the apparent spirit of the two parties and their resolve to complete the process of national unity under a new Government.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa06">It is essential, of course, that Mozambique restart and intensify its efforts at economic growth, which has been considerably retarded by the past hostilities. Mine clearance has presented a formidable obstacle to this process, particularly in the production of food, and my delegation is pleased to note the Secretary-General's continuing emphasis on this area. Unfortunately, the impact of cyclone &quot;Nadia&quot;, which struck on 24 March, seems to have had widespread destructive effects on infrastructure and total crop production and may lead to significant food shortages in many areas, as the outlook for the coming harvest is only fair. Combined with the mine problem, this is another critical reason for Mozambique to move with all deliberate speed to implement the Peace Agreement, hold the elections and install a Government of national unity. Then economic growth and development can move forward in earnest.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa07">In the area of humanitarian assistance, my delegation is pleased to see that the international community has responded to the Trust Fund set up to assist Mozambique in its reintegration and demobilization programmes, mine clearance and vocational training. The Secretary-General has also established a special trust fund for assistance to register political parties to enable them to carry out electoral activities; this also merits support.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa08">Finally, my delegation notes with appreciation the Secretary-General's efforts to contain the costs of ONUMOZ while refocusing its mandate, activities and manpower. The introduction of the Civilian Police Component (CIVPOL) will mesh, to the extent possible, with the reduction of military units and other support staff to hold costs at prescribed levels; but, at the same time, the goals of monitoring, observation training and leadership will not be allowed to suffer.</p>
	<p id="pg005-bk02-pa09">There are many to praise, it seems, in the Mozambique effort, from ONUMOZ members to United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and the Special Representative. My delegation will therefore support the draft resolution before us.</p>

	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa03">On 11 April President Chissano announced that the elections would take place on 27 and 28 October 1994. The National Elections Commission and its provincial offices have been established. In principle, voter registration should begin in about 20 days. With a view to this result, the parties have continued to display responsibility and restraint. Since the signature of the Rome accord, the cease-fire has been respected. More recently, the demobilization of forces and the transfer of weapons have begun.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa04">To be sure, disturbing delays have been noted, for the most part concerning implementation of the process. It is to be hoped that, the assembly areas having been created as contemplated, the two parties will abide by the timetable and complete the demobilization, which is central to the implementation of the peace agreements.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa05">All this shows that the parties are determined to succeed. In this connection, my delegation commends the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, who has succeeded in convincing all concerned that the only option is a peaceful political outcome.</p>
	<p id="pg006-bk04-pa06">It is desirable that the Council should regularly consider the situation in Mozambique, especially with respect to areas in which we have noted delays. For its part, my delegation will spare no effort to ensure that, when they go to the polls very soon, Mozambicans will be able to endorse the reconstruction and democratic development of their country.</p>

	<p id="pg007-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of France for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Grey</span> <span class="nation">United States</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa01">We welcome you, Sir, to your new duties as Council President, and we know that you will steer the Council this month with style, wit and determination. We also recognize and applaud the skilful, innovative performance of Ambassador Keating as last month's President.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa02">The United States welcomes the progress of the Mozambican peace process laid out in the Secretary-General's report of 28 April. We are particularly pleased that elections have been set for 27 and 28 October. The United States Government strongly believes that any further delay would be not only unacceptable to the international community, but seriously damaging to Mozambique's own interests as well. Elections are essential to move forward national reconciliation and economic reconstruction.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa03">The Secretary-General's report makes it clear, however, that much more remains to be done between now and the October elections. A way must be found to move the stalled demobilization process to a rapid conclusion. We believe it would be wise for the gates of the assembly areas to be closed to new arrivals on 1 June in order to make it more likely that demobilization will be completed by 15 July. We expect both sides to cooperate with the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) in verifying the number of troops remaining to be processed both at the assembly areas and at the non-assembly sites, and to do everything possible to hasten their demobilization.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa04">Also of concern are the difficulties being experienced with formation of the new army. Recruitment has been slow, and it is apparent that the 30,000-man force envisioned by the Rome accord will not be trained and operational by the time of the elections. This development should not delay the holding of elections. To avoid holding prospective new soldiers in camps with little to occupy them until the additional training programmes required for them are developed, we would urge that recruitment for the new army be suspended during the electoral period. Moreover, since underdevelopment and a stagnant economy are the real threat to Mozambique's security, we firmly believe that careful consideration should be given to creating a smaller new national army.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa05">Not all the obstacles to progress are being encountered on the military side of the peace process. It is equally important to overcome the many administrative and logistical barriers to voter registration and the electoral campaign. For this reason, the United States joined other Council members in urging the Government and RENAMO to support fully the work of the National Elections Commission and to ensure that all parts of the country are open to electoral activity. We are also concerned about the apparent lack of cooperation received from Mozambican police authorities by ONUMOZ civilian police observers. The United Nations police component has an essential role to play in assisting the Mozambican police to establish the conditions for free and fair elections. Their deployment must be facilitated in every way possible.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa06">Notwithstanding the problems ahead, the Secretary-General has expressed his belief that conditions are in place for the timely completion of the ONUMOZ mission and has indicated that he will submit in July a final timetable for its termination. In addition, we look forward to receiving the revised budget estimates for ONUMOZ, which the Secretary-General has indicated will remain within currently authorized commitment levels, and to the timely implementation of his plans for a drawdown of unneeded military personnel.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk02-pa07">By extending the ONUMOZ mandate until 15 November, the Security Council has signalled its confidence that the successful culmination of the peace process is in sight. It remains the task of the Mozambicans to determine finally whether their country will this year become another example of hope and national reconciliation in southern Africa.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk03-pa01">I thank the representative of the United States for the kind words he addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg007-bk04">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Wood</span> <span class="nation">United Kingdom</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa01">Let me begin, Sir, by offering you the good wishes of the United Kingdom delegation upon your assumption of the office of President of the Council. My delegation also expresses its admiration to Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand for the excellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of the Council in the month of April.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa02">My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General, in which he records the progress made in the implementation of the General Peace Agreement for Mozambique since the adoption of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-898(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 898 (1994)</a>. We were particularly pleased by the announcement by President Chissano on 11 April that elections will take place on 27 and 28 October this year. This is a major step forward. It is essential to stick to that deadline.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa03">The next few weeks are crucial for the successful implementation of the peace process. The parties need now to redouble their efforts to meet the electoral timetable. Further delay is in no one's interest. For Mozambique the elections and the successful completion of the peace settlement represent a new beginning. For the international community, sticking to the timetable is crucial.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa04">We remain extremely concerned about the slowness of progress towards implementing some key aspects of the Agreement. The assembly of forces is behind schedule. It really needs to be completed by 1 June, as set out in the resolution we have just adopted. ONUMOZ has still not been given accurate information on the number of troops remaining to be assembled, nor has it been allowed access to military bases to verify the presence of military equipment. It is essential that this is now done. Likewise, progress in demobilization is still lagging. Both parties, and especially RENAMO, should commit themselves fully to completing demobilization by 15 July. We consider this the key to successful implementation of the peace process.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa05">My Government is also concerned about the slow pace of building up the new Mozambican Defence Force. We hope the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO will now move speedily to identify the soldiers required to form the Defence Force. Regular pay must be provided for them. The training of the new army must be accelerated. We warmly welcome the offer by Zimbabwe to provide assistance in the training of infantry battalions and hope that this offer will be taken up quickly.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa06">We recognize that another crucial step along the road to the successful completion of the electoral process is the transformation of RENAMO into a political party. We support the appeal in the resolution for the international community to contribute to the Trust Fund for RENAMO in terms of financial assistance for the implementation of the General Peace Agreement. My Government has just contributed £500,000 to this Fund. We also support the appeal for contributions to the special trust fund for assistance to the registered political parties.</p>
	<p id="pg007-bk04-pa07">We believe that the elections in Mozambique can take place on schedule if the parties are determined to achieve this. We exhort them to summon the political will that is needed. The international community for its part will do all it can to help and will accept no second-best outcome.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for his kind words.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg008-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Kovanda</span> <span class="nation">Czech Republic</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa01">My delegation would first wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming office. You have successfully steered several other bodies of these United Nations, during which time you have amply demonstrated your leadership abilities - abilities which include your much-appreciated sense of humour.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa02">Allow me too to thank my good friend Ambassador Colin Keating, who last month dealt with several vexing, important and difficult questions with enthusiasm and with great dedication.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa03">Different countries of the cone of Africa south of the Equator are facing an exceptionally broad array of political circumstances at this moment. On the one end of the spectrum, there is the hell of Rwanda. My delegation is appalled by the situation in that country and has been shocked by the fact that neither the Security Council nor the Secretariat has so far managed to describe the massacres in Rwanda by the only word that fits them - namely, genocide.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa04">On the other end of the spectrum, there are the heartening developments in the Republic of South Africa. Despite all their flaws, we feel that the recent elections, which some of our own officials observed, will be certified as having been free and fair. We are encouraged that the level of pre-election violence, however tragic, was manageable, and we congratulate the new leadership of the country and wish it well.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa05">Somewhere between these two poles are Angola and Mozambique. The situation in Angola continues to be unclear. Elections were held, but one party refused to abide by their outcome, and fighting in the country resumed. Protracted negotiations between the antagonists are continuing in Lusaka. With protracted negotiations, the fighting has been protracted as well.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa06">There is one lesson we have learned from developments in Angola - namely, it improves the chances of an orderly transition if the armed antagonists are demobilized prior to elections. This lesson is being applied in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa07">Some progress has been made since we discussed the situation in that country last time. Still, we are troubled by continuing signs of laxity in meeting the pre-election commitments of the parties. Demobilization started only in March, rather than in January, and nothing can be done about that now. One would expect, though, that in view of its late start demobilization would progress at an appropriately accelerated pace. Instead, it has recently slowed down. Assembly of the remaining troops is at a near standstill. Delays in the disbanding of over 150,000 militia and paramilitary forces are worrisome. There are problems with verifying military equipment at various installations. Both sides are in control of certain military bases, which they are keeping off-limits to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ).</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa08">The creation of the new Mozambican Defence Force is also continuing more slowly than anticipated. Its creation is critical not only as a symbol of a new country but also practically, for example in combating the alarming rise in banditry and in protecting the transport corridors which are essential for Mozambique as well as for neighbouring land-locked countries.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa09">On the other hand, there is a political side to developments in Mozambique. In this context it is particularly important that an election date has been set for 27 and 28 October. This gives us a firm point to aim for. The speed of military and organizational developments preceding the elections has to be geared towards meeting that date, and the expressed determination of the parties to accelerate the implementation of the <i>Accordos da Paz</i> creates a helpful milieu for the elections to be successful.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa10">Indeed, leaders of both sides have recently met and agreed that the Government would accelerate the assembly of its troops and that RENAMO would accelerate the pace of its own demobilization. All of this is encouraging.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa11">The overall question perhaps is: Is the glass half full or half empty? My delegation thinks it prudent to watch for deeds rather than words, and looking at deeds - that is to say, at the situation in the field - we fear that the glass is still only half empty. We will be carefully watching the speed with which more content dribbles into it.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa12">The Secretary-General's thorough and well-balanced report also points out the practical difficulties that the National Election Commission might face. With the experience of South Africa behind us, we point out the importance of voter education, the pitfalls in voter registration and the need to ensure voting opportunities even in the most remote parts of the country.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa13">The continuing role of the United Nations in assisting Mozambique's passage from virtual chaos to elections is unmistakable. It is very encouraging to see that the end of this passage is in sight. In the last couple of years, the United Nations has launched a dozen or so peace-keeping operations. Successfully closing down an important operation, which our resolution foreshadows for ONUMOZ, will be an important marker not only for Mozambique but for the Security Council and the United Nations system as well.</p>
	<p id="pg008-bk02-pa14">The Czech Republic is one of the 19 countries whose officers are serving as military observers with ONUMOZ, one of the total of 30 countries that provide ONUMOZ with personnel. We are proud to be able to make our modest contribution to the peace process in that country, and I pay a tribute here to the entire United Nations operation, including troops, military observers, civilian police and, last but certainly not least, the United Nations humanitarian assistance programme.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk01">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of the Czech Republic for his especially kind words addressed to me.</p>
</div>

<div class="spoken" id="pg009-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Chen Jian</span> <span class="nation">China</span> <span class="language">Chinese</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa01">First of all, Sir, I wish to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month. I am confident that with your rich diplomatic experience and talents you will surely provide excellent guidance to the work of the Council for this month.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa02">I should also like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand, for his outstanding contribution to the successful conclusion of the work of the Council last month.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa03">The Chinese delegation is pleased to note that with the joint efforts of the United Nations and the two parties of Mozambique the peace process in that country has witnessed important progress in many fields. It has been announced by President Chissano that elections will take place on 27 and 28 October 1994. This is undoubtedly an important step towards the realization of peace in Mozambique and is an encouraging development.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa04">However, we have also noted that there still exist some difficulties in implementing the General Peace Agreement, difficulties which remain to be resolved.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa05">The peace process in Mozambique is now at a crucial juncture and there is not much time left before the elections scheduled for October. Considering that ONUMOZ is playing an important role in accelerating the peace process in Mozambique, the Chinese delegation supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of ONUMOZ, and voted in favour of the resolution just adopted.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa06">The experience of ONUMOZ has proved that as long as the two parties to the conflict are sincere about resolving their problems through negotiations and unswervingly implement the agreements reached by the parties, it is highly possible for them, with the help of the international community, to end yesterday's suffering and open up a new vista.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa07">It is on the same basis that United Nations peace-keeping operations will achieve success. We sincerely hope that with the joint efforts of the parties ONUMOZ can become another success story in United Nations peace-keeping operations. Mozambique needs peace and stability. Africa, too, needs peace and stability. Only under conditions of peace and stability can economic development and social progress be achieved and people live in happiness and prosperity.</p>
	<p id="pg009-bk02-pa08">We therefore urge the two parties of Mozambique to seize the opportunity before them by adopting practical and effective measures and by cooperating fully with ONUMOZ in the implementation of the General Peace Agreement and the relevant Security Council resolutions. This will ensure that the elections are held as scheduled, thus creating the conditions for the early realization of national reconciliation and the achievement of the peace and stability that have been cherished for so long.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk01">

	<p id="pg010-bk01-pa01">I thank the representative of China for his kind words addressed to me.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg010-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Pedauye</span> <span class="nation">Spain</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa01">Allow me first of all to congratulate you, Sir, on the skilful way in which you are steering the work of the Council, thus demonstrating your experience and your outstanding professional abilities. You may be assured of the assistance and cooperation of the Spanish delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa02">I wish also to express my delegation's appreciation and thanks to Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand for the very able and effective way in which he presided over our work in April.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa03">The Security Council has just unanimously adopted <a href="../pdf/S-RES-916(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 916 (1994)</a>, which renews the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) until 15 November 1994. My delegation welcomes this important decision, which indicates the course to be followed towards the holding of free and fair elections in Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa04">The announcement made by the President of Mozambique on 11 April 1994 that general elections would be held on 27 and 28 October this year was greeted by the international community with satisfaction and hope. The setting of these historic dates is a tangible demonstration of the firm resolve to comply with the revised timetable for the full implementation of the General Peace Agreement, thus bringing to culmination a peace process which will enable the people of Mozambique to decide on and define its own future.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa05">The Secretary-General, in his report of 28 April 1994, refers to certain delays relating to the assembly and demobilization of troops and to the formation of the new Mozambican Defence Force. These are matters of concern to the Council and are properly reflected in the resolution we have just adopted. My delegation trusts that the concerted political will of President Chissano and Mr. Dhlakama, as demonstrated at the meeting of 8 April 1994 at which the two agreed that the Government would expedite the assembly of its troops and that RENAMO would accelerate the pace of its demobilization, will bear fruit and have a positive effect in the field.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa06">In order to overcome these delays, the resolution we have adopted urges the parties to meet the targets of 1 June 1994 for the completion of the assembly of forces and 15 July 1994 for the completion of demobilization. The parties likewise must ensure that ONUMOZ is provided with accurate information on the exact number of troops which remain to be assembled and must allow ONUMOZ access to all their military bases to check military equipment as well as to verify the number of combatants still outside the assembly areas.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa07">We have taken careful note of and welcomed the statement just made by the Permanent Representative of Mozambique, Ambassador Comissario Afonso, who emphasized that his Government is fully aware of the need to implement fully the mandate of ONUMOZ and that the Government will do everything in its power to achieve that objective.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa08">We believe that it is necessary to speed up that process so that the pre-electoral period can begin in Mozambique, a period in which the National Elections Commission will play a fundamental role and in which the Civilian Police Component of ONUMOZ (CIVPOL) will help to improve the climate of respect for law and order throughout the country, thus securing the freedom and transparency necessary for the normal conduct of elections.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa09">The parties must also allow ONUMOZ, including the police observers, unimpeded access to the areas under their control. The same goes for all the political forces in the country, in order to ensure free political activity in the whole territory of Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa10">We believe, with the Secretary-General, that it is possible to hold free and fair elections in Mozambique if certain minimal conditions are met: namely, free access by the National Elections Commission to all areas of the country; the widest possible participation of political parties at all levels of the electoral process; free access to State mass media; logistic support from the Government and the donor community to the electoral process; and the total and unconditional commitment by all parties to accept the results of the elections once the National Elections Commission has declared them free and fair and this has been confirmed by the United Nations.</p>
	<p id="pg010-bk02-pa11">Spain is following carefully developments in the peace process in Mozambique. We have felt certain from the outset that a promising future lies ahead for that country, to which we are bound by close ties of friendship and cooperation, as is shown by our participation in the United Nations Operation in Mozambique and reaffirmed by the dispatch of Spanish observers to perform police functions. We are therefore gratified that the Council is continuing its endeavours to make the peace process in Mozambique another exemplary model of harmony in the African continent.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg011-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Keating</span> <span class="nation">New Zealand</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa01">I would like to begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of May. The Council has before it again a very challenging agenda, but your well-known diplomatic skills and experience are guarantees that our work will be conducted effectively and efficiently. May I also express appreciation to Council members for the kind comments they have directed to myself and to my delegation.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa02">My delegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for his report on the situation in Mozambique. It highlights a number of positive developments in the ongoing peace process in that country. New Zealand welcomes the commitment which the parties have shown to maintaining the cease-fire in Mozambique and to implementing the provisions of the General Peace Agreement. The regular meetings between President Chissano and Mr. Dhlakama have been crucial in this regard, and we believe continued dialogue between the two leaders will be the best way to ensure the positive momentum is maintained.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa03">We welcome the announcement by President Chissano that general elections will be held on 27 and 28 October. This announcement is a significant step forward, and, my delegation hopes, a signal of the intention of the parties to keep to the time-frame set by the Security Council. Through the adoption of the present resolution, the Council has further underlined the importance of the parties' adhering to this time-frame.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa04">The beginning of the process of cantonment and demobilization of troops is a further source of satisfaction. So, too, is the work begun on forming and training the new Mozambican Defence Force. But there have been substantial delays in implementation of these processes. We are particularly concerned that the assembly of troops now appears to be at a near standstill, and that agreement has not yet been achieved on the way to advance the training process for the new Defence Force.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa05">My delegation would like to underscore that the timely completion of these processes is crucial to ensuring that free and fair elections take place in October. The parties must honour their obligations under the General Peace Agreement and do so in a timely fashion. They must also extend their full cooperation to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ).</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa06">The Secretary-General has noted that the United Nations demining programme has also suffered significant delays. This is a matter of particular concern to my delegation, given that New Zealand has provided mine-clearance experts to ONUMOZ. Demining is a key element in the peace process, and continued delays affect other important programmes, such as those to assist internally displaced persons and returnees. We welcome the Secretary-General's intention to accelerate the demining programme. We will be looking for this issue to be covered in detail in his next report in July.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa07">The resolution we have just adopted is an important one. It covers the crucial final period of implementation of the General Peace Agreement. It extends the mandate of ONUMOZ over that period, and at the strength proposed by the Secretary-General. My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to maintain the observer component of ONUMOZ at its current strength. We believe the observers have an essential role to play in the lead-up to the elections, particularly in the post-demobilization phase, when the cease-fire will need to be carefully monitored.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa08">New Zealand also shares the Secretary-General's caution about further reductions of the military component of ONUMOZ before the elections take place. Let us be clear: there are very real prospects of a successful conclusion to the peace process in Mozambique. It would be tragic indeed if the process faltered at the final stage because of a lack of resources or personnel shortages.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa09">Of course, we would expect that careful monitoring of the expenditure of ONUMOZ will be continued and that appropriate economies will be achieved wherever possible.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa10">New Zealand has consistently supported the General Peace Agreement as the way to lasting peace in Mozambique. We have also lent practical support to the peace process through our participation in demining and through our support for ongoing humanitarian programmes in that country.</p>
	<p id="pg011-bk02-pa11">May I conclude by commending the Secretary-General, his Special Representative and the personnel of ONUMOZ for the work they have done, and are continuing to do, in Mozambique.</p>

<div class="spoken" id="pg012-bk02">
<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Cardenas</span> <span class="nation">Argentina</span> <span class="language">Spanish</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa01">First of all, Sir, I wish to express my delegation's satisfaction at seeing you preside over the Security Council for the month of May. Secondly, our appreciation goes to Ambassador Colin Keating of New Zealand for his work last month, which we feel was both difficult and exceptional.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa02">My delegation has taken careful note of the detailed report presented by the Secretary-General on the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ). We are gratified, of course, by the progress made by the parties - the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO - in implementing the General Peace Agreement, which should culminate in the successful conclusion of this process with the holding of elections, which, it has been announced, will take place on 27 and 28 October. We also welcome the maintenance of the cease-fire, the beginning of the training programme for the new Mozambican Defence Force and the fact that the National Elections Commission has started functioning.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa03">We also find particularly encouraging the commencement of the process of cantonment and demobilization of the forces of both parties, but we share the concern over delays in implementing major aspects of the General Peace Agreement. In this respect, we appeal to the parties to renew their commitment and to implement fully and without delay the provisions of the Agreement, lending their unrestricted support to the important electoral process that is now under way, including the work of the National Elections Commission.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa04">While emphasizing that the ultimate responsibility for the success of the process now under way must, clearly, be borne by the people of Mozambique, who will also be its beneficiaries, my delegation believes that the international community should be unstinting in its support for this process in order to cooperate in ensuring that it is completed within the agreed time. In this context, we pay tribute to the work of ONUMOZ, to which Argentina contributes with a military hospital in Maputo and with military observers.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa05">Through the resolution that we have just adopted, we support the renewal of the mandate of ONUMOZ until 15 November next, in accordance with the recommendations of the Secretary-General in his last report and without prejudice to the effective completion of its mandate.</p>
	<p id="pg012-bk02-pa06">We urge the parties to cooperate with UNOMUZ and in particular with the police observers who have been deployed in accordance with <a href="../pdf/S-RES-898(1994).pdf" class="pdf">Security Council resolution 898 (1994)</a>. We call on them to comply with the deadline set for the holding of the elections - that is, at end of October. We also wish to emphasize the endeavours and successful activities of the Secretary-General, through his Special Representative, and of the Organization of African Unity in implementing the General Peace Agreement. We hope that these concerted efforts and the objectives of peace and reconstruction will yield the desired result of a promising future for Mozambique.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">Mr. Sidorov</span> <span class="nation">Russia</span> <span class="language">Russian</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa01">At the outset, on behalf of the delegation of the Russian Federation, I should like to wish you every success, Sir, in your responsible and difficult post as President of the Security Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa02">We are grateful to the Permanent Representative of New Zealand, Ambassador Colin Keating, for his skilful leadership of the Council in April.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa03">The Russian Federation supported the draft resolution adopted today, which it considers to be an important step taken by the Security Council towards the successful completion of the peace process and the holding of general elections in accordance with the established calendar. As stressed in the report of the Secretary-General, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-511.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/511</a>, the major political conditions for this have been met.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa04">Today's decision of the Security Council clearly directs the Mozambican parties to expedite their full implementation of the Peace Agreement and to resolve specific issues surrounding the preparations for the elections. Of special significance are questions relating to the assembly and demobilization of troops and the creation of a new army. In this connection, we consider extremely important the provisions of the resolution urging the parties effectively to correct the imbalances and disproportions they have allowed to arise and calling upon them to comply with the timetable established for the peace process, which will help strengthen the climate of trust and constructive cooperation between them at this key stage in the settlement. In our opinion, it is precisely such an approach, and not the putting off of complex problems until after the elections, that will allow us to avoid complications which, as we have seen from our experience in the settlement of conflicts in several other countries, can make much more difficult the realization of a process of national reconciliation in its final stages.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa05">There is little time left before the elections in Mozambique, and we trust that all the Mozambican parties will make effective use of the favourable conditions offered them by the international community and will eliminate any remaining problems and successfully prepare for and hold the elections.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk02-pa06">We proceed from the premise that the Security Council will continue to follow carefully the course of the peace process in Mozambique in order to avoid any hitches in the strict observance of the time-frame set for the elections and the clear fulfilment of the ONUMOZ mandate.</p>

<h3 class="speaker"> <span class="name">The President</span> </h3>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa01">I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for his kind words addressed to me.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa02">I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Nigeria.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa03">The resolution which we have just adopted marks a very important step forward in the process of fulfilling the United Nations mandate on Mozambique. My delegation was pleased to vote in favour of it because it underlines the international community's abiding commitment to the peace process in Mozambique, which, if carried to its logical end, will enable the country to begin a new era of peace and development. We are also greatly encouraged by the sound and hopeful nature of the analysis of developments in Mozambique presented by my friend and brother Ambassador Pedro Comissario Afonso in his statement before this Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa04">The Secretary-General's report, contained in <a href="../pdf/S-1994-511.pdf" class="pdf">document S/1994/511</a> of 28 April 1994, which constituted the basis for the present resolution noted, <i>inter alia</i>, three major difficulties which still have to be overcome before the due date of the elections in October.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa05">First, there are the continuing delays in the implementation of major aspects of the General Peace Agreement, in particular the assembly and demobilization of troops, militia and paramilitary forces, and the formation of the new Mozambican Defence Force. Secondly, the parties have been reluctant to provide accurate information on the number of troops which remain to be assembled. Thirdly, only limited access has been given to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) to military bases to verify military equipment.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa06">On the other hand, the Secretary-General's report noted the important development that the President of Mozambique had announced that the general elections would take place on 27 and 28 October 1994 and that, to that effect, the National Elections Commission had been inaugurated. Similarly, some principal officials have been designated and the President of Mozambique, Mr. Chissano, and the President of RENAMO, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, have continued to have regular dialogue. Furthermore, the cease-fire has continued to hold throughout Mozambique and on 8 April both the Government and RENAMO entered into an agreement which bound the Government to expedite the assembly of troops and RENAMO to accelerate the pace of its demobilization to meet the targets of 1 June 1994 for the completion of the assembly of forces and 15 July 1994 for the completion of the demobilization process. On its part, however, the Security Council should ensure that any drawdown of the military components of ONUMOZ does not compromise the security environment which is essential for the conduct of free and fair elections, scheduled for October 1994.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa07">The Government of Nigeria is confident that Mozambique has every promise of a successful international effort in that country. For a number of reasons, therefore, the resolution which we have just adopted is not only timely but also very appropriate.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa08">First, it rightly extends the mandate of ONUMOZ to 15 November 1994, beyond the election date of 28 October 1994, to allow sufficient time for the operations to wind down and for the post-election dust to settle. Secondly, it calls upon the parties - in particular RENAMO - to comply fully with all the provisions of the General Peace Agreement, expedite the assembly of troops and accelerate the pace of demobilization of troops. Thirdly, with regard to the new Mozambican Defence Force, the resolution calls upon the parties to ensure that the maximum possible number of soldiers are trained for the Force before the elections take place. Finally, the resolution we have just adopted welcomes the commencement of the deployment of the United Nations police observers as authorized in paragraph 2 of <a href="../pdf/S-RES-898(1994).pdf" class="pdf">resolution 898 (1994)</a> of 23 February 1994 and stresses the importance the Council attaches to the fullest cooperation of the parties with the police observers of ONUMOZ.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa09">Finally, my delegation appreciates the very important role which the international community has continued to play in Mozambique. We commend in particular the efforts of the United Nations, its specialized agencies and other humanitarian agencies operating in Mozambique. We appeal to them not to relent in their efforts or in their disposition to provide financial and humanitarian assistance until peace and stability fully return to Mozambique. That is when victory will be certain for all the people of Mozambique.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa10">I now resume my function as President of the Council.</p>
	<p id="pg013-bk03-pa11">There are no other names on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.</p>
