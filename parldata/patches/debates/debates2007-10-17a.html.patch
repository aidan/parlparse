  In view of the appalling ongoing situation in Burma, I welcome yesterday&#146;s announcement by European Ministers of stronger sanctions against that country, but I especially welcome my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#146;s promise of aid if the Burma regime moves towards greater democracy and reconciliation. What more does he think that we can do to help the people of Burma?</p>

  I wish to raise two main issues&#151;why this happened and who is responsible, and the individual concerns of my farmers&#151;but I shall start by paying tribute to Government Ministers. When the news broke on that Friday, they went to some lengths to be in touch with me. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) received the same treatment, as did many other Surrey MPs. Ministers were vigilant about keeping in touch with all of us throughout that weekend, the following week and when the second outbreak occurred.</p>
