  For reasons of consistency, which we believe should continue in the Bill. The regulation-making powers are concerned largely with the administration of the scheme, and we believe that the time of the House would be better spent dealing with them through negative rather than affirmative resolution, especially as all the regulations are set out. I appreciate that the Opposition would prefer regulations to be made by affirmative resolution, but given the amount of time available to the House to discuss such matters, we believe that the negative procedure will be sufficient. Of course, the Opposition are free to pray against those regulations if they wish to do so.

 <a name="30708-47_para19">Government amendment No. 238 is one of a small number of minor technical drafting amendments, like amendment No. 236 which I have already covered, consequential on the wording of amendment No. 237. The intention is simply to ensure that references are consistent throughout this part of the Bill. Government amendment No. 239 is another minor drafting amendment consequential on the wording of amendment No. 237, as is Government amendment No. 240. Government amendment No. 241 is the last of the minor amendments designed to ensure consistency.
