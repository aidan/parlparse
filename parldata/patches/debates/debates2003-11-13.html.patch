  To provide a little more information, it is correct that discussions between Southern Water and Eastleigh borough council are good at present, but that is as a result of several years of frustration. I make the point again that planning officers in the borough council have had to suffer the frustration of asking for comment from the water company on large-scale planning applications coming through their office, and have had the sorry situation of not getting a response at all. That is the issue&#151;is compulsion necessary? Does a statutory obligation need to be placed on the water companies so that they are part of this planning process?
