  Thank you for calling me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and let me say that I think my remarks should fall well within the available time limit. I am a member of the European Scrutiny Committee, and I should perhaps begin my remarks by conveying the apologies and regrets of its Chairman, my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty), who ordinarily would have wished to have participated in the debate. Unfortunately, however, he is away on other European scrutiny business.</p>
