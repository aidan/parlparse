  I shall keep my remarks brief. I have suffered the experience, which I know many hon. Members have had, of receiving representations from honest, hard-working constituents who have been part of companies that, for various reasons, have not been able to meet their pensions obligations. Sigmacast, formerly known as Triplex, in my constituency&#151;a long-standing foundry&#151;was subjected to a management buy-out last September. The pensions fund was found to be &#163;18 million short, and the successor company was not prepared to sponsor a successor pension fund. The result is that some 150 workers, who would have enjoyed deferred benefits, have been told that they will get nothing at all.
