 <p><a name="stpa_o39"><a name="70119-0002.htm_para17"><a name="07011960000095">So there we have it&#151;from the next Labour leader, and possibly the one after that&#151;localism is the future. Today, we have a Conservative MP adopting a Bill originally promoted by the Liberals and supported&#151;in principle, at least&#151;by half the parliamentary Labour party. It asks a very tough question of this or any Government: &#147;How serious are you about giving power away?&#148; Its premise is straightforward. If we accept that community decline is a fact and that it carries a significant and growing social risk, the only way effectively to manage that risk is to give local authorities and the people whom they serve real power. When it boils down to the fundamental question of who knows best, the unequivocal answer from this Bill is that local people know best.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_o40"><a name="70119-0002.htm_para18"><a name="07011960000096">After 20 years of centralisation of power, we must accept that it is time to turn the wheel back, to give residents more influence over how to build and improve their communities, and to see local government less as agents of central Government and more as instruments of local people. I think that the Government are serious about taking the first steps in this direction. This Bill urges them to be bolder, and I ask the House to support it.</p>

Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd). I intend to be very brief because I know that other Members wish to speak. I am pleased to be here today to deal with such revolutionary legislation; indeed, it warms the cockles of one&#146;s heart to be doing so. I shall put on my T-shirt when I get home, as it were, and feel that we have done a little bit to move democracy in the right direction.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_o41"><a name="70119-0002.htm_para19"><a name="07011960000098">I want to make just two points, but I want first to say in passing that although it would be nice to feel that it is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill, the Bill of the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy), or my Bill, it is not: it has emerged from genuine community action. Although the New Economics Foundation crystallised it, it is not its Bill, either. Indeed, it is not even the Bill of Ron Bailey and Stephen Shaw, who have gone round the country participating in some interesting public meetings, two of which I held in my own constituency.</p>
