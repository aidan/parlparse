  (Lab): My right hon. Friend will be aware that next year is the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. Does he agree with me that, with each decade that passes, it becomes ever more important to remember and commemorate the sacrifice of that great generation of the 1940s? They fought in the Arctic, Europe and Asia to defend our liberties and democracy, and to create democracies in countries that previously did not know democracy.

  I thank the Secretary of State for sending me a copy of his statement an hour or so ago. Our first thoughts are for the families of those who lost their lives in the serious and tragic accident. I extend our deepest sympathy to the family of driver Stanley Martin, who died doing his job, the families of the others who died and the passengers who travelled last Saturday, expecting their journey to be safely completed. We also sympathise with all those who were injured and suffered the horrifying and inevitably frightening experience of being involved in a serious accident.

  The local community is very shocked by this dreadful accident, and I would like to send my deepest sympathy to the families of all those who have lost loved ones, and to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;injured. I would also like to add my thanks to the emergency services and the members of the local community who responded magnificently when the crash occurred. Will the Secretary of State give me his personal assurance that the safety concerns that I sent to the HSE again this morning will be properly considered, including the question of whether more safety features can be built into the future design of railway carriages? Many of the injuries in this crash occurred under rapid deceleration as people and luggage were detached from where they should have been.

  I attach some importance to that as, having met those who were affected by some of the major rail accidents that happened before I was Secretary of State, it is clear to me that what is important, among many other things, is that people are kept in touch and that they understand what is going on. That is why I was keen to ensure that both Network Rail and First Great Western, which will take the lead in this since it was its train, should get in touch with people and deal with their immediate concerns, as well as concerns that will probably arise over the next few weeks and months.

  The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) is right that the purpose of Lords amendment No. 18 is to give the power to the Secretary of State. The other amendments are consequential and relate to the procedure for making regulations.
