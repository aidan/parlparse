Those three elements combined&#151;voting reform for Westminster, stronger devolution within England and an imaginative use of the new House of Lords&#151;could provide a better way forward than the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Bill. It will doubtless be 20 or 30 years before we actually do anything about these matters, but we should keep the discussion going.</p>

  There is only so much radical reform of the constitution that one can do in one week, and we have perhaps exceeded our quota. It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), and it will surprise neither him nor the House to learn that I agreed with a lot of what he said. I was interested to discover the revelation that he was born in Devon, and it is also clear that he has been in Hampshire for so long that he now thinks of himself as a southerner, rather than a west countryman. I am a west countryman and that is my identity, but that does not prevent me at the same time from being English and British. Our roots within this country are important, as are the people whom we represent.</p>

Whenever anybody suggests that one area is in the south-west, somebody else says, &#147;Oh no it isn&#146;t, we&#146;re the real south-west.&#148; That is inevitable when the Government office for the south-west stretches from the Isles of Scilly to Tewkesbury and Tewkesbury is nearer Scotland than Cornwall&#151;<i> [Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) looks doubtful, but it is true&#151;he should look at the map. To make an international comparison, the south-west would be a country the size of Belgium, which is one of our problems. Although many of us know perfectly well where we come from, our friends just down the road say that we come from somewhere else.</p>

Until then, we must retain the good in what we have, which is the UK Parliament with Members elected on the same mandate and with the same powers of speaking and voting in this place. We must address by other means the anomalies that undoubtedly exist.</p>

  I congratulate the hon.
