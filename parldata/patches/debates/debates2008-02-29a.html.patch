 <p><a name="stpa_o49"><a name="80229-0002.htm_para15"><a name="08022977000124">The current abysmal lack of enforcement, with weak penalties anyway, means that, while there is still some classification, the system for enforcement has effectively broken down. Mr. Muspratt described to me the vast numbers of illegal videos and DVDs moving around the country&#151;that is the case even before we start thinking about the internet.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_o50"><a name="80229-0002.htm_para16"><a name="08022977000125">I am grateful to the Prime Minister for agreeing to see the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) and me. I am very much aware that the Government have commissioned Dr. Tanya Byron to research the children&#146;s end of this issue. I must say, however, that although I was very impressed with the work that she is doing when I met her, this is not just an issue about children. Britain today has a rising tide of violence, particularly sexual violence against women and young girls. Much of it, especially when they are trafficked, never reaches official statistics, but the official statistics are bad enough. The perpetrators are not typically under 18. The tide of violence available through the media, including films, DVDs, videos and video games is fuelling the problem. The evidence shows overwhelmingly that that is the case, so I urge the House to give the Bill its Second Reading.</p>

  I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and I congratulate him on his good fortune in the ballot, which has given him the opportunity&#151;one that few hon. Members have&#151;to bring a Bill on such an important issue before the House. The hon. Gentleman presented his case with skill and eloquence&#151;there was no hysteria in what he said&#151;and he brought to Parliament&#146;s and the public&#146;s attention an issue of crucial concern. It is a 21st century issue that, as a result of technological changes over the last 20 years, will impact on every single household and every single child in this country and beyond.</p>
