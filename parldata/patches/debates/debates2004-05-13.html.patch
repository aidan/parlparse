  The Royal Marines of 40 Commando based in Taunton are currently preparing to return to Iraq&#151;the last time they were there, they bravely liberated Basra. The Leader of the House may not know&#151;although the Secretary of State for Defence will&#151;that the return is earlier than planned. Will he ask the Secretary of State for Defence to come to this House sooner rather than later to confirm whether the Marines are replacing or supplementing existing troops?

  The Royal Marines of 40 Commando have, as the hon. Gentleman says, given distinguished service, and we are grateful to them given the difficult circumstances in Iraq. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, will address the House after me, when the hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to raise the matter.
