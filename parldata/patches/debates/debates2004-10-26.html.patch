 My final exhortation is this: let us make up our minds quickly and move on, because there are more important matters for the House to discuss.

  May I reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)? Nomination to Standing Committees is controlled to a large extent by the Whips, who are generally unwilling to nominate hon. Members from their own party unless they are considered reliable. Those of us who are somewhat idiosyncratic in our approach to party discipline do not always find ourselves nominated. As a result, the Report stage is the only real opportunity for hon. Members like us to address the detail of a Bill.
