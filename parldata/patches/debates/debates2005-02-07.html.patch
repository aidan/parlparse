  The advice that I have received is that we are confident that the Iraqi national guard is making significant progress and is on track to be fully operational by September this year. In the south-east area of Iraq, we have decided to speed up the process by gifting more than &#163;27&nbsp;million-worth of equipment to the Iraqi security forces, to make them still more capable. As I have said several times before, our aim is to ensure that the Iraqi security forces are capable of taking responsibility for their own security. The sooner they are trained and assuming that responsibility, the sooner the security environment will improve and the sooner our troops will be able to come home.

  (Lab): The Minister will undoubtedly be aware of the meeting on 19&nbsp;January between the Secretary of State for Defence, local MPs and representatives of the Royal Gloucester, Berkshire and Wiltshire regiment. Can he confirm that at the meeting the issue of recruitment was discussed? If the infantry is already reviewing recruitment, would it not make sense to put on hold the decision to disband the RGBW?

  I have just explained one of the actions that we have taken, which was issuing the Defence Council instruction, but we have also agreed a strategy with the Electoral Commission to increase awareness and ensure registration. As I made clear to the House during the last Defence questions, I am keen for all members of our armed forces to register to vote.

  (Con): But does the Minister understand that when those of us sitting in Westminster or in our constituencies get a note from the local district council saying, &quot;Please register your vote&quot;, it is very different from the circumstances for soldiers on the move in Iraq, Afghanistan, or wherever it may be? That is the problem with the 2000&nbsp;Act. On 20&nbsp;January, the Minister said: &quot;Things are not nearly as bad as they seem.&quot; Actually, approximately two thirds, or possibly three quarters of the British armed forces and their spouses are disenfranchised. We have heard that the website is four years out of date and that people are threatened with &#163;1,000&nbsp;fines. When will the Minister take action to give every potential service voter and their spouse a form to ensure that they are all registered in time for the impending general election?

  Headquarters Recruiting Group, a part of the Army Training and Recruiting Agency, is responsible for the Army&#039;s recruitment budget. In financial year 1998&#150;99, the Army spent &#163;50.1 million on recruiting. In the following four financial years, spending was as follows: in 1999&#150;2000, &#163;56.4 million; in 2000&#150;01, &#163;55.5 million; in 2002&#150;03, &#163;68.4 million and in 2003&#150;04, &#163;71.4 million.

  As at October last year, when data were last collated centrally, the number of servicemen and women overseas on postings and operations was 42,000. As I told the House earlier, we are working closely with the Electoral Commission to raise awareness of the options for service personnel to register to vote. I have made it absolutely clear that my personal preference for those serving overseas is for them to have a proxy vote to ensure that their vote is cast at any election.

  Well, that rant&#151;that is the only word that I can use&#151;was notable for its lack of comment on our detailed proposals, and for the right hon. Gentleman&#039;s reiteration of two fundamental weaknesses in his policy. First, he reiterated the official Opposition&#039;s commitment to quotas. I want to make it absolutely clear&#151;in a way that the whole House, including Conservative Members, will understand&#151;that the Tory quotas would damage our economy and our world-class education system and remove existing fundamental human rights under international law. It is an arbitrary, populist and impractical assertion that can achieve nothing, and I was disappointed at the right hon. Gentleman committing himself to it yet again.

In the autumn of that year, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) and I called on the then Minister of State to reinforce personally our concerns. No action was taken by the Home Office and the floodgates opened. In 1996, approximately 50&nbsp;applications for asylum were made in Kent. Can the Home Secretary say how many asylum seekers are currently resident in Kent and what in his statement today will prevent the many asylum seekers who are now illegally on the electoral register from voting in the election?

  I am grateful for that Question. My hon. Friend is right. It is important that the approach should go right across Government. For example, we intend to work with our colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure that the law is enforced strongly and coherently in relation to employing people who are in the country illegally. We intend to work with our colleagues in the Treasury and elsewhere on establishing a border regime that works extremely carefully. We intend to work with the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills to ensure that we have a proper regime for the recruitment of people coming into the country. In relation to housing, it is particularly important that we have that dialogue with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. So we are working right across the range and will continue to do so.
