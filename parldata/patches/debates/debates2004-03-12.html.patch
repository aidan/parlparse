 personal tragedy for the affected family. It is always difficult for a family to deal with sudden death that takes a loved one. It is even more difficult to come to terms with the death of a young person. As other hon. Members have said, the anguish and sense of loss is compounded when medical authorities cannot explain why a fit, healthy young person suddenly dies. That adds to the emptiness, and to the questions that the family has to ask. We all want logical answers to the question of why things like sudden death happen. Often, families are simply left to ask why and to question what could have been done to turn the clock back. The Bill makes a practical suggestion for helping to prevent such tragedies from occurring in other families.

 previous two years, which illustrates the scale of the problem. Such property repairs are carried out by criminal gangs. There is no written contract, and the unwritten contract is completed immediately or very swiftly. Some people may think that the Bill is draconian but, as the hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) said, it will not affect reputable businesses. It is designed to catch people who undertake criminal activity, not legitimate businesses. It is not designed to stop unemployed people selling dusters door to door, however intimidating some old people find them. Indeed, people have written to me saying that they would prefer it if no one knocked on their door. The Bill will, I hope, stop the worst abuses. It is not perfect, but it does provide a solution to the problem.

These were, first, a proposed new fraud offence; secondly, a fraudulent trading offence for individuals; thirdly, a ban on work or payment within seven days of a cold call; and finally, a ban on cold calling for property maintenance or repairs. The latter issue is, of course, the subject of the Bill. I hope my hon. Friend will accept that although those who operate at the coal face against doorstep crime see merit in the first three options, they are likely to prove extremely limited in practice.

It set out what was known about prostate cancer and established a framework for future action, and it explained the action that the Government propose to take in three relevant areas: research; prostate specific antigen testing; and improvement of services for patients with urological cancers, including prostate cancer. I will briefly review the progress that has been made in each of these areas in the past three and a half years.

 for prostate cancer patients alongside information for members of the general public who just want to find out more about the disease. The website will be key in helping men make informed choices about prostate cancer right along the patient pathway, and I am delighted to be able to confirm to my hon. Friend today that the Government will provide two thirds of the funding for the website. That amounts to some &#163;40,000 in the current financial year, with further funding over the next two years. The website will be developed in close collaboration with NHS Direct and the coalition for cancer information. The final third of the funding will be provided by signatories to the prostate cancer charter for action, a great example of the Government and the voluntary sector working together for the benefit of the people of this country.
