 I am grateful for being called to speak immediately after that invitation from the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson), as there is one political party that will make climate change a priority at the election. I agreed with almost everything that he said, and I can assure him that he will sympathise with many things in our manifesto. I am afraid, however, that people will not have a chance to vote for us in England.</p>
 <p>I am very pleased indeed that the Liberal Democrats have called for this Opposition day debate. I acknowledge that they have used such debates to introduce such matters in the House, whereas the Government have been rather remiss in providing debates on climate change. The usual suspects are in the Chamber. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Indeed, people can see for themselves where there are gaps on the Benches. We have reached consensus on the science of climate change, but we do not have consensus on the political tasks needed to deal with the problem. I shall get the political bit over before I address more consensual matters. If any party, MP or member of a party thinks that we can achieve a carbon-free future without using wind energy they are shutting the door on a solution to climate change. Anyone who thinks that that is a realistic prospect will let down severely the people of this country, the environment and future generations.</p>

  What a fine note on which to end the Back-Bench contributions. With perhaps one exception, I am grateful to all the right hon. and hon. Members who spoke in an excellent debate, which shines as an oasis of rationality in the turmoil and pre-electoral bombast in which we so often indulge.

 I need no reminding about the dangers of terrorism: I was in Congress on Capitol hill in Washington DC on 11&nbsp;September 2001&nbsp;and saw the evidence of terrorist action with my own eyes. We face a serious threat, and the difficulty is finding an equilibrium between providing freedom from fear or worse for our citizens, which is every Government&#039;s duty, and freedom under law, which is what we are looking to the Government to provide.

  On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I seek your guidance on a matter, but I am not sure whether what I have to say is a brief contribution or a point of order. I speak as a former member of the Standards and Privileges Committee, although I was not involved in this case in any way. Normally, the procedure adopted on such occasions is that the Member against whom a finding has been made will agree his statement with Mr. Speaker before presenting it to the House, as the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) has done&#151;
