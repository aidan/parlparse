 than some of the second world war veterans wear on Remembrance day. That is a tribute to how often our servicemen and women go on operations.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_o395"><a name="80619-0019.htm_para15"><a name="08061961000155">Unusually for a former Foot Guard, I also wish to pay tribute to the Life Guards and the Household Cavalry, because they go on operations as well as carrying out their ceremonial duties. I was very moved by the Westminster Hall debate on Lance Corporal Compton last week. I have met Lance Corporal Compton and his burns are horrific. As I said, the House was shocked when I mentioned the fact that a bullet-proof vest is not fire protective. If a soldier is in a Scimitar that is hit, as Lance Corporal Compton was, and his colleagues are dying around him and he is alight, the last thing he needs is for the uniform that has been issued to protect him to burn. That is frightening. If nothing else comes from this debate today, I hope that we will now look at how we protect our servicemen and women in the field.</p>

  I add my tribute to those that have been paid so warmly today to the fallen. It is a sad day today for British defence procurement, because the Minister has announced&#151;sotto voce, if I may say so&#151;the reduction in the number of T45s from the 1998 assumption of 12 to six. That is to be regretted.</p>
