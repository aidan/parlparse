  I listened with great interest to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who made a very good speech, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) discussing their amendments, which dealt with questions that were never answered. Does my hon. Friend agree that the clause gets to the heart of the matter, because it is a &#147;trust me&#148; clause? The Government are essentially saying, &#147;Don&#146;t worry about all this stuff. We&#146;ll tidy this up and get on with it in due course. You don&#146;t need to worry your pretty little heads any more about the European Union treaty. We&#146;ll deal with it.&#148; Is there any reason at all why we should trust Governments on that, when we were given a constitutional guarantee at Maastricht that the pillar system would remain?</p>

  My right hon. Friend makes a good point. He homes in on the issue of trust. The Government have broken their word so many times throughout this process&#151;on the referendum and on the promise that we would have 20 days&#146; debate and line-by-line scrutiny. Their word has been undermined so many times that for them to come to the Committee and say, as my right hon. Friend put it, &#147;Trust me,&#148; rings extremely hollow. His point is very well made.</p>
