  My hon. Friend is absolutely right: new services, bringing in new customers, will make our post offices successful in future. Already, some 20 million current account holders with Barclays, Lloyds TSB and Alliance and Leicester can bank electronically at post offices, and I am delighted that that became 21 million banking customers yesterday because Clydesdale bank has now reached the same agreement with the Post Office.

  I very much agree with my hon. Friend&#039;s sentiments, including his support for a strong Iraqi trade union movement. Indeed, I understand that Iraqi trade union representatives are at the TUC conference in Brighton this week. Democratisation of Iraq is a vital priority and my hon. Friend is right that the focus should be on establishing that. The Government are working hard to achieve a democratic Iraq, with trade union rights.
