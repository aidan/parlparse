  I am glad that the Minister is shaking is head, because I am not trying to make a cheap point, and would never do so. There are substantial grounds for believing that there are many cases in which a lesser degree of evidence is required than in the cases that we are discussing. I take very seriously the point about intercepts made by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth). We must consider the matter carefully, as it leads to a fundamental question that arises again and again. At the heart of my concern about the legislation, as with identity cards, is the balance between the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the protection of the public. I have frequently written about that in national newspapers in the past few years. We face enormous terrorist threats and, as the Minister conceded, the danger from terrorism is still severe. He knows that better than me, as he is in possession of facts that are not available to the public at large&#151;I accept entirely the reasons for that. Given the severe danger facing the public and the necessity of maintaining a proper system of liberty for alleged suspects it is essential that we think more carefully&#151;a one-and-a-half hour debate is not sufficient&#151;about the continuation of an Act that spokesmen on both Front Benches believe is wholly unsatisfactory. I have never in my life been more convinced that a piece of legislation has led to a wholly unsatisfactory state of affairs. The Government, the official Opposition and the Liberal party all agree, to adapt the famous words of Thomas Becket in &#147;Murder in the Cathedral&#148;, that this is bad legislation for all the best reasons. That is the crucial question that faces us:</p>

Public health will continue to be central to the work of a reformed, smarter, 21st-century health service. Public health demonstrates the Government&#146;s ambitions for the nation&#146;s health, ambitions shared by the British people. Only by working together can we make the difference, and that is what we will continue to do.</p>

  I wonder what our constituents will make of the complacency that is evident in the Minister&#146;s remarks. The press today correctly reflects public anxiety over soaring obesity rates and reports that nearly a quarter of adults are now classed as clinically obese.</p>
