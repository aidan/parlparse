 <p><a name="40615-05_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Denis MacShane) </b> 
 : I welcome the adoption by Turkey of wide-ranging reforms to improve its human rights performance. I particularly welcome the release of Leyla Zana and three former Kurdish MPs pending their appeal and the first TV broadcasts in Kurdish last week. However, I deplore the imprisonment of the journalist Hakan Albayrak of <i>Milli Gazete</i> and hope that he will soon be released.
