  (Con): May I join a modest celebration and congratulate Ministers on the way in which they have expanded the choice available to my rural constituents by making use of the availability and capacity of the private sector? Does the Minister, in accepting the success of that scheme, believe that it is time to expand it further to alleviate the suffering of people who have had to dip into their savings to afford life-changing, or life-saving, treatments?

  The hon. Gentleman&#039;s party&#039;s policy is to force people to pay from their own pockets if they want choice, while our policy is to give people choice without their having to spend extra money. He would unleash inefficiency on the health service by allowing people to buy from the private sector one at a time. When we choose to use the private sector, we negotiate and buy in bulk, and get cost effectiveness as a result.

  I am sure that the Minister is aware of my early-day motion 667, entitled &quot;Review of NHS Funding for Children&#039;s Hospices&quot;, which highlights a differential that exists whereby children&#039;s hospices receive only 5 per cent. of their funding through the NHS while adult&#039;s hospices receive up to 38 per cent. of their funding in such a way. There is genuine concern throughout South Yorkshire about the disparity, so will the Minister meet me to discuss the matter in greater detail?

  I would be happy to meet my hon. Friend, but I must stress again that services for children&#039;s hospices need to be based on the needs of individual children, not on the basis of a blanket figure that he or I might think appropriate.

  I thank the Minister for her answer as far as it went, but will she have discussions with her colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills, as successive attacks on the school meal service by this Government and the previous one have seriously affected the health and well-being of children? Will she also ask her colleagues in the national health service why they are promoting unhealthy products through the NHS &quot;Popzone&quot;, as it is not acceptable for the NHS to promote such products?

  I am happy for the hon. Gentleman to send me anything about which he is discontented so that I can have a further look at it, but we are in regular discussions with the DFES about initiatives to encourage and enable children and their families to make healthier food choices, including national healthy school standards, the food in schools programme, the school fruit and vegetable scheme, the healthy living blueprint and healthy start. A range of initiatives is therefore under way to improve children&#039;s health as well as the food that they eat during and outside the school day.
