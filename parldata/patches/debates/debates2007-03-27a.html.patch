 <p><a name="stpa_o242"><a name="70327-0013.htm_para9"><a name="07032777000504">The Tories have massive spending commitments, but they want to promise tax cuts. That is why they have their third fiscal rule, which attempts to square a circle, but that cannot be done. The rule would have meant &#163;21 billion less spending this year alone. That third rule is a rigid, inflexible approach that takes no account of what the economy needs. It would not have allowed the investment that we have made in public services over the past seven years. The Leader of the Opposition said that his policy would make a &#147;dramatic difference&#148;. Indeed it would: he would have spent substantially less at the very time that our economy needed that spending over the past 10 years. It is that incoherence that led to the massive economic problems of the last Tory Government in the early 1990s, in which the Leader of the Opposition played such a central and pivotal role as a key adviser.</p>
