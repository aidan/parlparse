  That is entirely correct. Indeed, people would even be able to transfer a stakeholder pension into the wrapper of the SaRA, if that was what they preferred. The objective will be to simplify the situation so that all their pension entitlement is in one wrapper, which they can understand and get information on easily, cheaply and to their own benefit.

  We need to return to the point about who the pension provisions were for. Let me repeat that the millions of pensioners living in poverty, having to live on just &#163;69 a week, would not consider themselves to have a very strong pension provision.
