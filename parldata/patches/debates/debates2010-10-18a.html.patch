However, if we are explicitly to give this responsibility to the Electoral Commission, which I have no doubt it has asked for-given the advice it gave to the Government-we should provide some mechanism for accountability. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to give that serious consideration, so that we can, I hope, save dividing the Committee and move on to the next group of amendments as quickly as possible.</p>

  I have reservations about amendment 136. I fully understand the spirit in which the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) argued for it, but I have concerns about requiring the agreement of the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. Would the Committee have to agree on absolutely every bit of material, therefore having some sort of editorial control, with only their imprimatur and nihil obstat determining what goes? I am not sure that it would not put the Committee in a potentially invidious position-indeed, hon. Members have already asked questions about what side of the argument the Committee members are on. The safeguard that the amendment is trying to achieve might turn out to be more complicated and hazardous.</p>
