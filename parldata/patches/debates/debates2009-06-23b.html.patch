Member for Arundel and South Downs and others raised the involvement of local authorities in the designation and implementation of the coastal path. The Government&#146;s intention has always been to involve local authorities fully in many aspects of the Bill. We see them as extremely important partners, not least in the coastal access project. Following the constructive discussions that we had in the other place, we have amended the Bill to make that clear.</p>

They include consulting local interests, contacting and discussing options with landowners, and managing the work required. Where those authorities are willing and able to act, they will be fully involved in the implementation of these proposals.</p>

I pay tribute to him for his work, just as he paid tribute to the work that this Government have done in bringing forward the Bill. We need to take account of socio-economics, but we have to get the balance right. We know the expectations outside the House, but we have to deliver what the Bill proposes. We must deliver sustainability in the seas and conservation, but the Bill is also about securing sustainable livelihoods. I am looking forward to teasing out that balance in Committee.</p>

However, there will be other areas in which the wide variety of interests can be represented. What we do not want is to have super-duper versions called &#147;highly protected areas&#148; and others that are not as good. All the MCZs will be important, and will contribute to the ecologically coherent network.</p>

That latter point, which was also raised by other hon. Members, is something that we will return to in Committee. He also referred to seascapes, another matter that I am sure will come up in Committee. Seascapes are mentioned in the high-level marine objectives that were published earlier in the year, and they will be covered by the marine policy statement.

- I am most grateful to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the redevelopment of Edgbaston cricket ground, which has generated an enormous amount of interest and concern among the communities surrounding the ground.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_o461"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para19"><a name="090623120000040">The Warwickshire county cricket ground at Edgbaston has both a national and an international reputation. There is no doubt that a facility such as Edgbaston gives added value to the city. However, like other sporting venues in the city, including St. Andrews and Villa Park, Edgbaston is located in a primarily residential area&#151;it is described as leafy&#151;so it has to take account of the impact of its activities on the local community, not least in terms of congestion, parking and noise when matches are held. Although some local residents would prefer the cricket club to relocate elsewhere, I believe that the majority are not opposed to the club remaining at Edgbaston, provided its activities do not impact unreasonably on the residents and the local environment.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_o462"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para20"><a name="090623120000041">The planning application submitted by Warwickshire county cricket club towards the end of 2008 was for</p>
-<a name="90623-0021.htm_brev21"><a name="090623120000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;a new stand incorporating spectator seating, player, media and visitor facilities, museum and library, club shop and offices, conferencing, banqueting and exhibition facilities. The erection of five floodlighting columns and lights. Demolition of two dwelling houses at the Cricket Club and twelve houses on Pershore Road. Erection of mixed use development comprising residential, offices and hotel, retail, restaurants and cafes, pubs and bars as well as leisure facilities and a crèche together with service basement and multi-storey car parking and public plaza and hard and soft landscaping&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="stpa_o463"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para21"><a name="090623120000042">I think the House will agree that the application was not for the replacement of old, dilapidated stands, but for a major redevelopment of the ground, which I very much equate with the &#147;Chelsea village&#148; concept incorporated in the redevelopment of Stamford Bridge football ground. The club estimated the cost of the scheme at &#163;32 million.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_o464"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para22"><a name="090623120000043">It is acknowledged that the facilities at Edgbaston needed to be improved and updated. Account also needed to be taken of the stipulation laid down by the England and Wales Cricket Board&#151;the ECB&#151;that if Edgbaston wished to host international day-night matches it would need to install permanent floodlighting bases&#151;not floodlighting pylons&#151;at the ground.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_o465"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para23"><a name="090623120000044">When the planning application went to the council&#146;s planning committee on 12 May, there was considerable annoyance locally that discussions and consultations with local residents and community organisations had been limited. At the meeting, the planning application was approved by nine votes to four. However, it had already been revealed that for some time the council&#146;s cabinet had been in discussions with the club about the possibility that a &#163;20 million-plus loan might be made available to assist with the redevelopment.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_o466"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para24"><a name="090623120000045">As part of the discussions, a report went to the cabinet on 6 April. Its most important point was that if the council did not make the loan to Warwickshire county cricket club, it</p>

Furthermore, the report that went to the council reminded councillors that if they refused to grant the loan of &#163;20 million, it would, as I said,</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_o468"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para26"><a name="090623120000047">Surely that puts the council in a very strong position in its negotiations with the Warwickshire county cricket club. The question is, therefore, whether it will use its strength to support the reasonable request of the local community, or give in to what the club is proposing.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_o469"><a name="90623-0021.htm_para27"><a name="090623120000048">After the planning committee approved the application, it was notified to the Government office for the west midlands, and there was a widespread expectation that the application would be called in because of the scale of the development and the fact that that development was taking place at a major national sporting arena. Furthermore, there had been an inquiry by a Government inspector in 2000, when Birmingham city council had resisted the erection of four permanent floodlighting installations of 52 m in height at Edgbaston, and the inspector dismissed the appeal by the Warwickshire county cricket club. The five pylons now being proposed are 50 m in height.</p>

- It is not quite correct to say that the previous application was called in, because the council did not determine the application, so it went to appeal. That is how it found its way to the inspector&#146;s desk. However, the council said that</p>

It also appears that assurances were given at that meeting that any loan would be conditional upon further &#147;consultations&#148;, as the note says.

I strongly believe that there is a basic pre-requisite for any loan to be conditional upon retractable lights at Edgbaston. When the Department&#146;s inspector considered the appeal by the cricket club to erect four permanent floodlight pylons in 2000, he was scathing in his objections. He stated in paragraph 25 of his report:</p>

The club finally ends by saying that unless permission were given for permanently erected floodlights, which it proposes, Edgbaston would lose its test status. That is totally untrue and misleading.</p>

Lord&#146;s has installed four retractable floodlights, which rise to a height of 48 m when fully erected and are lowered to a height of 29 m when not in use. They take approximately 20 minutes to erect. Furthermore, at the Oval, where the president of Surrey cricket club is the former Prime Minister Sir John Major, retractable lights have also been installed. The company that installed both sets of lights is Abacus Lighting, and it has also installed similar retractable floodlights at other sporting venues throughout the world. In a trade magazine article, its head of marketing, Kelly Herrick, makes a potent point:</p>

- Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure&#151;indeed, I consider it an honour&#151;to be the Minister responding to this Adjournment debate, as this is your first such debate in your new and deserved role as Speaker. You are responsible for my carrying out an act that I thought was impossible&#151;namely, voting Conservative three times yesterday. But, I believe that it was a price worth paying. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff) on securing this debate about an issue that I know is important to him, to a number of his constituents and to those living in the area.</p>

Friend recognises that Edgbaston is one of the key international sporting venues in the west midlands region. The cricket club is considered to be one of the largest of the 18 major county clubs that make up the English domestic cricket structure, and the ground has regularly been used as a test and one-day international venue.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_o486"><a name="90623-0022.htm_para5"><a name="090623120000069">The cricket club estimates that average attendance in 2008 ranged from 1,334 for the Friends Provident trophy to 7,958 for the Twenty20 cup. Test match fixtures average between 12,000 and 17,000 spectators per day, and one-day internationals usually sell out at 21,000 capacity. The club calculates that up to 200,000 spectators visit the stadium per year. It employs 78 full-time staff and a further 20 staff for regular events held at the club, and some 600 temporary staff are employed on each international match day.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_o487"><a name="90623-0022.htm_para6"><a name="090623120000070">The club estimates that the major matches staged in Edgbaston contribute up to &#163;12 million per annum to the local economy. I know that my hon. Friend recognises the value of that to Birmingham in terms of the visitor economy and the prestige of hosting international cricket. However, the club believes that it faces increasing competition in hosting major matches. Historically, test match cricket in England has been held at six locations: the Oval, Lord&#146;s, Old Trafford, Trent Bridge, Headingley and Edgbaston. Those venues have been able to rely on the substantial income generated by test match status, but other grounds are now challenging their position.</p>

-and Wales Cricket Board. The club estimates that major matches account for about 50 per cent. of the income that it generates, and that it is critical to both the city of Birmingham and the future economic stability of the club that it continues to be allocated major matches such as international cricket. Therefore, as my hon. Friend said, the club and its development partner, MCD Regeneration Ltd, made a planning application to Birmingham city council on 11 November 2008 for substantial redevelopment of the cricket ground. The proposals include a new, larger stand, an increase in seating capacity by 4,000 to 25,000, permanent floodlighting, and mixed-use development.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_o489"><a name="90623-0022.htm_para8"><a name="090623120000072">The club considers that mixed-use development is critical to generating sufficient funding to support redevelopment of the stadium. It believes that the proposals would create an estimated 3,000 construction jobs and 1,000 permanent jobs. Given the current recession, that would give an important boost to the local economy. According to an initial economic impact assessment, the proposal will generate additional gross value-added growth of some &#163;60 million over the next 10 years. The proposal would align with the policies in the west midlands economic strategy for promoting Birmingham and encouraging investment and development to improve its competitiveness and its standing as a global city.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_o490"><a name="90623-0022.htm_para9"><a name="090623120000073">The permanent floodlighting would be in the form of five metal floodlighting columns about 50m high, which would be cranked just below the halfway point at an angle of 50<sup>(o)</sup> to lean over the stand towards the pitch. They would replace the temporary floodlights erected on the back of heavy goods vehicles. The club believes that the more stringent facility requirements of the cricket board will mean that venues will remain viable only when they can provide high-grade international-standard floodlighting. It makes comparisons with other grounds that already have permanent floodlights, or that have planning permission for such facilities. It considers that it has taken into account the concerns that the inspector raised in dismissing the appeal on its earlier application for permanent floodlights in 2000. My hon. Friend mentioned that as well.</p>

I also know that Birmingham city council commissioned a report from the Institute of Lighting Engineers, which concluded that the scheme was acceptable and that nuisance for residents should be minimised. The club has agreed to a condition restricting use of the floodlights to 15 days per year and to no later than 11 pm.</p>

Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for the day-to-day planning control in their areas. It is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly, with the minimum of interference from central Government. However, there will be occasions when we consider it necessary to call in planning applications for the Secretary of State to determine, instead of leaving the decision to the local planning authority. Our policy is to be very selective about calling in planning applications. We will, in general, take the step only if planning issues of more than local importance are involved.</p>

I am satisfied that the issues raised do not relate to matters of more than local importance that would be more appropriately decided by the Secretary of State rather than Birmingham city council. As my hon. Friend may be aware, however, there is still an opportunity for the local community to help shape the proposals. The cricket club will be required to submit detailed applications on issues such as the height and design of the mixed-use development, which will be subject to full consultation. Birmingham city council has also asked the club to form a residents&#146; liaison group to allow issues of concern to be discussed.

However, it appears to have balanced the conflict with policies in town centres against the benefits to the area of the various aspects of the development.
