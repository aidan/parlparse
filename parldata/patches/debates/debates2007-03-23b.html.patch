  I also congratulate the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill) on bringing forward the Bill. I was not aware that he had been so successful not only in getting private Member&#146;s Bills on to the Floor of the House, but in piloting them to fruition, on which I also congratulate him. I congratulate him, too, on choosing this subject for his Bill, which is appropriate. As we see in the Chamber, it has a wide range of support across all sections of the House.</p>
