UNIDO recognises this. I had the pleasure of meeting earlier this year the Director-General, Dr. Carlos Magarin¯os. I was extremely impressed. He is a strong advocate of UN reform. Under his leadership, UNIDO has focused its activities, reformed its internal management structure, and made considerable effort to find new ways of working, including building new partnerships. It is essential that UNIDO&#039;s programmes at country level be a part of the UN development assistance frameworks and build on UN-wide assessments of need.

Dr. Magarin¯os well understands the need to integrate UNIDO&#039;s technical co-operation work with that of other organisations more effectively. This has led to the signing of a co-operation agreement with the United Nations Development Programme in September of this year. This agreement has two parts. The first is joint programming between the two agencies in private sector development. The aim of this co-operation is to implement the recommendations of the report of the United Nations Commission on the Private Sector and Development. This joint activity will involve better links between programmes already existing in both agencies and new programmes that may be developed in areas of mutual interest. Secondly, the agreement puts in place a pilot programme that will establish UNIDO desks in 15&nbsp;UNDP offices. That is a practical example of joint working on the ground.

- I do agree about that. I learned a great deal from my meeting with Dr. Magarin¯os earlier this year. I was very impressed by UNIDO&#039;s work, as I have said. That work is unique in the UN system, and that is why I genuinely welcome the opportunity that this evening&#039;s debate gives us to talk more about its contribution. We need to support UNIDO in extending the reach of its work, building on partnerships and finding people with whom it can co-operate. In that way, we will be able to see results on the ground in developing countries.
