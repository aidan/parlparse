  I do not know whether the Minister is going to respond to the debate, but it would be useful to have an answer to the points that I made about the need to strengthen the Bank of England&#146;s monetary authority in order to avoid future problems.</p>

  The hon. Gentleman&#151;[Hon. Members: &#147;Right honourable.&#148;] The right hon. Gentleman&#151;my apologies&#151;made an interesting speech commenting on some of the differences between the way in which the American authorities are dealing with the issue of Bear Stearns and the way in which Northern Rock was dealt with here. He will be aware, as will all hon. Members, that a consultation document on the future structure of the tripartite arrangement was issued on 30 January, and I hope that he will respond to it. He will also know that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has been dealing with his counterparts in the EU and the G7 to determine what lessons need to be learned from the new threats and issues that global financial markets face as a result of the huge increase in globally mobile capital, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred in his speech. There are lessons for everybody to learn, but we know that the problems in the global markets cannot be solved in the UK alone. They have to be solved by international co-operation and agreement.</p>

Increases in aviation duty will further price in the environmental cost of flying, as well as contributing to the funding of our public services.</p>
