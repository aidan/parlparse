  I was heartened to see the Liberal Democrats&#146; green tax document, which said that Ken Livingstone&#146;s congestion charge was a &#147;successful environmental tax.&#148; However, it goes on to say that the congestion charge had to be increased to maintain the reduction in the level of congestion that it first brought about. When she was chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)&#151;I assume that the hon. Gentleman knows her well, given that she was his campaign manager&#151;said that rise in the congestion charge was &#147;a price hike&#148; that had nothing to do with reducing congestion and everything to do with &#147;raising a bob or two.&#148; Which is it? Was the congestion charge raised in order to be more effective or to raise money? Can I offer the hon. Gentleman a third way&#151;</p>

  Order. I can offer the hon. Lady the opportunity to retake her seat. That intervention was far too long, as indeed the first one tended to be too long. There is a limited amount of time available for this debate and I ask hon. Members to be sharp and concise.</p>
