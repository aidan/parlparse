Many local authorities are involved in regeneration schemes involving the building of new houses and office blocks, and it is important that they take the lead in ensuring that those buildings are as energy efficient as possible. We must also bring parish councils back on board, because they are the best placed bodies to respond to local demand andto promote schemes locally so that individuals can become involved directly.</p>

It will certainly not transform the landscape of domestic climate change policy. For that, we need to look to the bigger beasts: the outcome of the energy review that the Minister is conducting and, critically, the decision taken on the national allocation to the second phase of the EU emissions trading scheme this summer.

The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland indulged in a little nostalgia about her early days. I nostalgically remember the manifesto on which I joined the then Liberal party in 1979, which talked about the very great importance of environmental protection. In those days, only the Liberal party among the mainstream parties was even talking about that issue, and we were regarded as bearded loonies for doing so. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am not entirely sure that I would have been capable of growing a beard in 1979.</p>
