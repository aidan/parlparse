 <p><a name="stpa_o17"><a name="80425-0002.htm_para7"><a name="08042574000134">The Government started off so well; they introduced initial first-stage restrictions on advertising on children&#146;s television to children under the age of nine, and since January there have been further restrictions that apply to all children&#151;that is, those under 16. We need my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to commit herself to taking the current Ofcom review seriously. Ofcom will report later this summer, having taken into account the evidence that it is considering. I am sure that it will receive a massive volume of evidence in the lead-up to publication of its report in July. It should not be frightened to recommend a 9 pm watershed, and I hope that my right hon. Friend and the Government will not hesitate to implement such a measure, or even go further if necessary.</p>

  I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. My closing point is about the seriousness of the epidemic of ill health that we are likely to face, and of the increasing incidence of diseases such as diabetes. Any risks and concerns associated with the Bill should therefore be considered in Committee, and the Bill should certainly be allowed to progress.</p>

  As I suggested in an intervention, I want to focus on the impact that the changing nature of the food that we consume has, not only on children&#146;s physical health, but on the mental health of children and adults. On the detail of what is in some of the food that children are consuming, a Food Commission nutritionist, Annie Seeley, said recently:</p>

  Yes, we should do that. As I suggested earlier, we should also make available more facilities in the community so that children, rather than sitting on the sofa, participate in sporting activities. As I pointed out, many food manufacturers are contributing to that effort.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_o59"><a name="80425-0004.htm_para5"><a name="08042574000216">Let me finish on the point I was making before we got slightly side-tracked. This is a very difficult, as well as exciting, time for television in this country, and it will result in huge pressures on the commercial sector. As Ofcom has determined, the measures in the Bill are likely to cost commercial television broadcasters &#163;224 million. That would be a catastrophic loss of revenue at any time; at this particular time, it would be hugely damaging. As I said to the hon. Member for Cheltenham, if I thought that the Bill would result in a dramatic improvement in the health of our children or in a huge reduction in the level of obesity, I might accept that there was a case for it, but nothing in the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South persuaded me that there is any evidence to suggest that the Bill will achieve that.</p>

  I congratulate the hon.

It is a great shame that he has wasted this opportunity. I am sure his Bill is well intentioned&#151;a little more generosity from me&#151;but, like other Members, I do not believe that it will address the important topic of obesity.</p>
