 <p><a name="stpa_o135"><a name="81030-0010.htm_para2"><a name="08103027000405">I conclude by making a plea to the Bank of England. If anyone at the Bank is watching proceedings here today, will they please take on board that small businesses need their interest rates reduced? We need to get interest rates down and to reduce the costs of borrowing and of capital. We need to give small businesses a fighting chance to have a prosperous future.</p>

  I will not detain the House for long, but I wish to make a few concluding points. I thank all hon. Members for taking part in the debate on what we all agree is an important issue. It is the second time in two weeks that the House has discussed it and I agree with the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker) about its importance.</p>

It is not the case that businesses need to show three years of full accounts to bid for public sector contracts. How to enable more small businesses to bid for those contracts is a legitimate issue to consider, and the Glover review, which we commissioned to look into that, should report next month.</p>
