+<ul>
   <p>(a) a function to make or receive a report or statement (including a function conferred or imposed by or by virtue of an Act passed after this Act) is transferred to, or made exercisable by, the Welsh Ministers, the First Minister or the Counsel General by an Order in Council under section 58, and
 <br>(b) immediately before the coming into force of the provisions of the Order in Council relating to the function, and enactment made provision (&ldquo;provision for Parliamentary laying&rdquo;) for a report or statement made or received in the exercise of the function to be laid before Parliament or either House of Parliament by the person making or receiving it.
-</blockquote>
