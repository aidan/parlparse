   <p><a name="06051719000079">I do not understand why Ministers are being so cautious. I have not doubted their good will because when I debated this matter with the previous Minister I believed him, and when I listen to these Ministers I believe them when they say that they have no intention of undermining Parliament and they intend to deregulate only on non-controversial measures. They give us every assurance that it has never crossed their minds to introduce politically controversial measures that might upset a significant minority or to avoid proper debate by taking it through their proposed process. I still cannot understand why the Government will not include that in the Bill, as they would bind all their successors&#151;and not just themselves&#151;if they did so. They are receiving advice from someone in the Department who does not share their deregulatory enthusiasm or who has a sneaking hope that one day a Government will get stuff through Parliament quicker and with less inconvenience. Why do the Government keep tabling late and mealy-mouthed amendments that do not live up to their undertakings? My praise for their deregulatory intentions would be followed by praise for their sensitivities to sentiments in the House if they tabled amendments&#151;alternatively they could accept the amendments tabled by the Conservative spokesmen and by the Liberal Democrats&#151;and include in the Bill something that they have been telling us since they first introduced it. I do not understand their reluctance to do so.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002567">7.30 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000080"><b><a name="06051719002590">David Howarth:</b> I agree with every word that the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) said, and I do not intend to add to his contribution. I shall, however, make a few points that have not been made in our debate.</p><p><a name="06051719000081">Our debate has focused on two amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that I am happy to support. Amendment (c) to Government amendment No. 46 removes from the Government&#146;s so-called veto&#151;it is not, in fact, a veto&#151;the requirement on the Committee to consider various things under clauses 2 and 3. New clause 14 attempts to provide a genuine parliamentary veto. I wish to make only one point about amendment (c). Yesterday, the Government were keen to tell us that their judicial review of ministerial discretion did not require the insertion of the word, &#147;reasonably&#148;, in the Bill. That creates a problem, as what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. The word, &#147;reasonably&#148;, does not appear in Government amendment No. 46, but &#147;considers&#148; does. That leaves scope for judicial review, as long as the problem of the Bill of Rights is overcome, as the hon. Member for Cannock Chase(Dr. Wright) said.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 919</b><br><p><a name="06051719000082">The Government should therefore say categorically in reply to the debate that they do not intend the amendment to override provisions in the Bill of Rights that forbid the courts from interfering with what happens in the House. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, if they say that that statutory form of words is not intended to have legal effect, why have they introduced the provision, as there does not appear to be an enforcement mechanism? They are therefore left in an obvious dilemma: either they add words to the statute that do not have any effect, or they must do what should always be done in the circumstances&#151;if one does not want words to have effect, one leaves the matter to convention or to the Standing Orders ofthe House, which are not justiciable. I fail to see why the Government have not taken that route.</p><p><a name="06051719000083">My main argument concerns new clause 14. The procedural protections against the misuse of the Bill are still required, because yesterday changes were made to the purposes for which the Bill can be used and to the subject matter to which it can apply. It can no longer be used to change itself, or to change the Human Rights Act 1998. However, we did not debate a far more important restriction&#151;the proposal that the Bill should not be used to change any of the country&#146;s constitutional arrangements. We did not discuss that amendment, so it is possible to use the Bill for those purposes. Yesterday, we examined the example of changes to trial by jury, which is not protected by the Human Rights Act. The Bill could be used to make dramatic changes to that right, and it is still possible to reform local government using an order under the Bill. There is therefore a great need for procedural protections, which is why we have proposed such protections in new clause 14 in addition to the so-called Committee veto, which, as everyone knows, is not a veto.</p><p><a name="06051719000084">The only argument against our proposal is that it will set a dangerous precedent. That argument suggests that we should not do the right thing now for fear that our slightly dim successors will not be able to tell the difference between the problem that we face and the problem that they face. Nevertheless, new clause 14 is not a departure, because there are such mechanisms, albeit with a slightly different construction, in Standing Orders. Standing Order No. 92 deals with what happens when a Bill has been considered by a Second Reading Committee or by the Scottish Grand Committee. The Report stage could take place in a Special Committee or in a Scottish Grand Committee. Standing Order No. 92 says that if a motion is introduced in the House to allow for that and 20 Members rise in their place and object,</p><a name="06051719002561"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the Speaker shall declare that the noes have it.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000085">Standing Orders already provide a blocking mechanism on procedure that requires a fuller hearing of the matter&#151;in this case, the Report stage&#151;than would otherwise be the case. That is precisely what we are trying to do in new clause 14.</p><p><a name="06051719000086"><b><a name="06051719002591">Mr. Roger Gale (North Thanet) (Con):</b> The hon. Gentleman has the text of the Standing Orders before him, and he is quite right. I do not have the text with  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 920</b><br>me, but I think that I am right that it does not specify that those Members should come from more than one party in the House.</p><p><a name="06051719000087"><b><a name="06051719002592">David Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite right&#151;the standing order does not provide that extra protection. However, new clause 14 does so: Members who object to the use of the procedure should not all come from one party.</p><p><a name="06051719000088"><b><a name="06051719002593">Mr. Heath:</b> Another blocking mechanism can be deployed by a minority of one. It is often seen and heard on Friday afternoons when we debate private Members&#146; Bills. It is usually the role of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) to shout, &#147;Object&#148;, thus preventing the progress of such Bills. A blocking minority can therefore act to procedural effect.</p><p><a name="06051719000089"><b><a name="06051719002594">David Howarth:</b> Indeed, that is a blocking minority of one from one political party.</p><p><a name="06051719000090">The purpose of new clause 14 is to protect minorities. It provides geographical protection&#151;we have heard the point about local Acts&#151;and it also protects political minorities in the House and within parties. A matter can be controversial for a substantial number of Back Benchers, but it may not be controversial for their Front-Bench spokesmen. We need a mechanism that allows such minorities not to block the progress of legislation completely, but to demand further debate.</p><p><a name="06051719000091"><b><a name="06051719002595">Mr. Gale:</b> The hon. Gentleman is kind in accepting interventions, but he has contradicted himself. He says that the provision is meant to protect minorities, including minorities in a single party. Forgive me, but it is not inconceivable that 70 members of the parliamentary Labour party would disagree with their Front Bench, as they often do so at present. If they wished to object, but did not receive any support from the Opposition, their objection could not be heard under his proposal.</p><p><a name="06051719000092"><b><a name="06051719002596">David Howarth:</b> At least the position of those Members would be better than it would be if the new clause is not accepted. The hon. Gentleman, if I may say so, is making the best the enemy of the good.</p><p><a name="06051719000093">The purpose of the new clause is to make sure that in circumstances where the matter before the House is controversial in the minds of a sufficient number of Members, the full Bill procedure will be used. The main problem that we have had with the Bill all the way through is that Ministers have told the Committee that they did not intend to use the procedure for controversial matters, but they have not been prepared to offer any substantive definition of &#147;controversial&#148;. That is why, to extract Ministers from that difficulty, Members on the Liberal Democrat Benches and in other parts of the House have tried to solve the problem procedurally. New clause 14 offers, in effect, a procedural definition of what is controversial.</p><p><a name="06051719000094">I cannot understand why the Government resist. They do so, presumably, because they do not want written into the Bill matters that could possibly become subject to judicial review. They want to protect  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 921</b><br>themselves from the courts, but, with their own system of a Committee veto, they are offering a line of argument that may well lead to the Committees of the House being subject to exactly the same review in the courts. I find that to be precisely the wrong way round. It ought to be Ministers, more than Committees of the House or the House itself, who are subject to the courts.</p><p><a name="06051719000095"><b><a name="06051719002597">Mr. McFadden:</b> May I begin by offering the House a point of information relating to a point of order raised earlier about the regulator&#146;s compliance code? I am advised that that was sent to the joint Chairmen ofthe Standing Committee which considered the Bill on3 April, and that copies of that draft have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, so I believe the document is available, even though&#151;</p><p><a name="06051719000096"><b><a name="06051719002598">Mr. Heald:</b> The Minister may know that that has been the subject of discussion between one of the Ministers&#146; offices and my own. I think it was I who raised the matter in Committee and asked that the code be made available to Members, and I was given no notification at all when the letter was sent to the Committee Chairmen. We were left floundering about, not knowing that it was in the Library. That was most unhelpful.</p><p><a name="06051719000097"><b><a name="06051719002599">Mr. McFadden:</b> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. I was trying to be helpful to the House by providing the information that I could find today about how the document had been distributed.</p><p><a name="06051719000098"><b><a name="06051719002600">Andrew Miller:</b> For clarification, the letter to which the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire(Mr. Heald) referred was the subject of a parliamentary question that I tabled, so it was in the public domain and he could have found it.</p><p><a name="06051719000099"><b><a name="06051719002601">Mr. Heald:</b> It is pretty discourteous for the matter to be left in that way, when I had specifically raised it in Committee.</p><p><a name="06051719000100"><b><a name="06051719002602">Mr. McFadden:</b> May I suggest that we return to the issue at hand?</p><p><a name="06051719000101">Listening to the contributions on the veto power, I am struck by a curiosity. Yesterday there were many contributions from hon. Members who argued that the powers set out in new clause 19, 20 and 21 were perhaps an improvement on the original version of the Bill, but that they were still far too wide. They could be used, for example, to abolish trial by jury&#151;we heard that again a few minutes ago&#151;introduce euthanasia, and possibly even recast our relationship with the European Union, yet today, in the discussion of the veto, which is related to those same clauses, the powers in them appear to have shrunk. We are told that the veto is not worth much because it is related to those powers, which yesterday were criticised as being so wide. Today they seem to have shrunk so much that they might not apply to our friend the Wolverhampton butcher. There is a curiosity in the criticisms of tying the veto to the powers set out in new clauses 19, 20 and 21.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 922</b><br><p><a name="06051719000102"><b><a name="06051719002603">Mr. Gale:</b> In the light of the letter that the Minister kindly sent to me earlier today, which is about powers in new clause 19, can he explain what he had in mind when he wrote that letter?</p><p><a name="06051719000103"><b><a name="06051719002604">Mr. McFadden:</b> With the Deputy Speaker&#146;s permission, I am happy to do so.</p><p><a name="06051719000104">The legal effect of new clause 19 relates to the power to remove or reduce burdens. The purpose for which the power can be exercised contains two alternatives. The first is the removing or reducing of any burden resulting for any person directly or indirectly from legislation. The second is removing or reducing the overall burdens resulting for any person directly or indirectly from legislation.</p><p><a name="06051719000105">Removing or reducing a burden from one person may increase the burdens upon others, so the first alternative could permit an overall increase on persons as a whole. For example, where a regulatory regime is being placed on a risk basis, costs on low-risk businesses could go down, while costs on high-risk businesses may go up.</p><p><a name="06051719000106">The second alternative requires a removal or reduction of burdens overall, although this would permit the imposition of new burdens where the overall effect was a removal or reduction of burdens. This is similar to the position under the 2001 Act; if a burden is removed, new burdens may be added. Orders as a whole, including any new burdens, must meet the safeguards, including, for example, being proportionate to the policy objective of the order.</p><p><a name="06051719000107">In particular, I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the precondition in clause 3(2)(c), which requires that Ministers consider that the provision as a whole</p><a name="06051719002562"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;strikes a fair balance between the public interest and the interests of any person adversely affected by it&#148;.</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000108">This precondition, which is clearly particularly relevant where burdens are imposed or increased, also mirrors the existing position under the 2001 Act. The explanatory document will include both a summary of consultation responses, and an assessment of the extent to which an order to be made under new clause 19 removes or reduces burdens. Also, a detailed impact assessment would be provided, where appropriate, and these documents would explain the rationale behind the proposals.</p><p><a name="06051719000109">The expectation is that in most cases the overall burden will have been reduced, but for the reason stated above the Government believe that we need the flexibility to add burdens as well as remove them, if these burdens are to be useful in delivering better regulation.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002568">7.45 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000110"><b><a name="06051719002605">Mr. Chope:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. In summary, when he replied yesterday to my question whether, on his interpretation of new clause 19,</p><a name="06051719002563"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;it may well result in this procedure being used in circumstances where overall burdens will be increased, rather than decreased&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 May 2006; Vol. 446, c. 783.]</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000111">and he said no, what he really meant to say was yes.</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 923</b><br><p><a name="06051719000112"><b><a name="06051719002606">Mr. McFadden:</b> What I have set out would be the intention in most cases, but there is the possibility that I outlined to the hon. Gentleman a few moments ago.</p><p><a name="06051719000113"><b><a name="06051719002607">Sir Robert Smith:</b> Having clarified that and confirmed that the evidence from the Department to the Select Committee on Procedure was to the effect that burdens could be increased under the clause, is the Minister not creating the ground on which we need an effective and sophisticated veto system to ensure proper scrutiny, if the Government are to use a regulatory reform or regulatory deregulation Bill to increase the burdens on society? Measures should be properly and effectively scrutinised in the House to make sure that they do not unnecessarily increase burdens. We therefore need the amendments that we tabled to constrain the procedure through which the House might examine those burdens.</p><p><a name="06051719000114"><b><a name="06051719002608">Mr. McFadden:</b> Well, I think that that is what people call &#147;a stretch&#148;, although I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need effective scrutiny procedures. If hon. Members allow me to proceed with my remarks, I shall set out how those scrutiny procedures will operate.</p><p><a name="06051719000115">Government amendments Nos. 46 to 55 fulfil a commitment made in Standing Committee to provide parliamentary Committees in both Houses with a statutory power to veto orders. Noting concerns about the procedural safeguards in the Bill, Government amendments provide that Committees can veto orders under any procedure; negative, affirmative and super-affirmative.</p><p><a name="06051719000116">I want to stress at the outset the important point that the Government have given careful consideration to the form that the promised veto should take. We have sought to listen and to respond to views on the issue raised during the passage of the Bill, including those of the Select Committees, most of the Chairmen of which have spoken, and we hope to continue that dialogue. I assure hon. Members that the Government will continue to listen to views on the most appropriate way to ensure that the safeguards in the Bill are effective and workable.</p><p><a name="06051719000117">As has been said, the veto is not a blanket veto. Committees will, of course, be able to oppose an order on any basis that they choose, which is the case under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. Several hon. Members have asked me to clarify that matter, and I reiterate the Government&#146;s commitment not to push through orders in the face of Committee opposition. I must add that the Government have always adhered to that commitment in the operation of the 2001 Act.</p><p><a name="06051719000118"><b><a name="06051719002609">Mr. Heath:</b> The Minister has said that the Committee can reflect on any matter in reaching its recommendation. Government amendment No. 46 states that</p><a name="06051719002564"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;A recommendation may be made under subsection (2B) only if the committee considers&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000119">the criteria. How can that mean &#147;anything&#148;?</p><p><a name="06051719000120"><b><a name="06051719002610">Mr. McFadden:</b> The statutory veto relates to the powers set out in the Bill. If it were operated, it would mean that the order could not continue to be made by  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 924</b><br>the Minister. However, it would not constrain the Committee from opposing the order on other grounds, in which case the legal consequences would not be triggered and the Minister would seek to adhere to the terms of the undertaking. The statutory veto relates to the powers in the clauses that we discussed yesterday, but the Committee can express a view in other terms, should it wish to do so.</p><p><a name="06051719000121"><b><a name="06051719002611">Mr. Kenneth Clarke:</b> Will the Minister explain the logic of that proposition? He rightly accepts that the Select Committee will be totally unconstrained when it comes to considering the merits of an order, so if it wants to vote against an order or express a view, it can consider anything it likes. When it comes to what procedure should be followed, however, the Select Committee would be tightly constrained by the terms of the statute. What on earth is the point of allowing the Select Committee full discretion on debating the merits of an order, but to confine it so closely on the procedural point of cutting out parliamentary debate? There could be orders that the Select Committee is against, but on which it approves of the procedure, and there could be ones of which it is in favour, but on which it thinks that there should be full procedure, because it knows that many other hon. Members want to consider the matter. Why distinguish between the two?</p><p><a name="06051719000122"><b><a name="06051719002612">Mr. McFadden:</b> The position is symmetrical because the statutory veto relates to the powers in the Bill, which is the point made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office in her intervention on the Chairman of the Procedure Committee. We were asked to introduce a statutory veto, but we were also asked to narrow the powers in the Bill. The Government amendments include a statutory veto, which relates to the narrowing of the powers in the Bill that the House agreed yesterday.</p><p><a name="06051719000123">In the context of amendments to focus the order-making power more explicitly on better regulation objectives, it was considered appropriate for the veto to provide a symmetrical and focused check on that power. The Government consider it right that proposals are judged on the extent to which they deliver the regulatory reform agenda, and it is right that the proposals are judged on whether the conditions in the Bill are met.</p><p><a name="06051719000124">First and foremost, the veto is intended to present an effective and workable mechanism to protect against the abuse of the order-making power in the Bill. To that end, the veto builds directly upon the strengths of the existing system for scrutinising orders. The conditions to which the veto is tied are consistent with those contained in the Standing Orders of relevant Committees under the 2001 Act, conditions against which Committees have previously tested and, in one case, rejected regulatory reform orders. The Government believe that those conditions continue to represent key indicators on whether a proposal is suitable for delivery by order.</p><p><a name="06051719000125">Additionally, the veto addresses concerns surrounding a Minister&#146;s capacity to implement Law Commission recommendations &#147;with changes&#148;, which has raised questions about the extent to which a recommendation can legitimately be altered when it is  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 925</b><br>delivered by order. In a case in which a Committee judges a recommendation to have been changed to such a degree that the recommendation can no longer be seen to implement a recommendation of the Law Commission, the Committee can exercise the statutory veto. As has been noted, however, the Government acknowledge the need for continued discussion about the most appropriate way in which to take forward the provision of a veto for Committees, which is a delicate issue. As was said yesterday, one of the reasons why the Bill is delicate is that it touches not only on what the Executive may want to, but on the relationship between the Executive and Parliament, which is why we are open to continued discussion on those matters.</p><p><a name="06051719000126"><b><a name="06051719002613">Andrew Miller:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the tone that he is adopting and think that further discussion is necessary. Will he ensure that the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) is covered in that discussion? It would be unacceptable to the House and, indeed, to the Executive if we were to end up in a position in which the work of a Select Committee could be subject to judicial review.</p><p><a name="06051719000127"><b><a name="06051719002614">Mr. McFadden:</b> I am happy to take that point on board in the ongoing discussions, in which I hope that the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee will be an active participant.</p><p><a name="06051719000128">A number of the Opposition amendments to new clauses 5, 6 and 14 and to Government amendments Nos. 46, 50 and 54 explore alternative arrangements for the veto. I hope that hon. Members will consider the issues raised during the debate and the rationale for focusing the veto on the powers and conditions in the Bill. I also hope that they are assured of our intention to continue to engage with Parliament on that issue.</p><p><a name="06051719000129">Some of the amendments deal with the issue of where the responsibility for exercising the veto should lie. They specify that the Committee capable of using the veto should be one</p><a name="06051719002565"><ul><p class="tabletext">"with responsibility for the matter".</p></ul><p><a name="06051719000130">Presumably, the rationale behind the amendments is to open the issue of changes to the structure of Committee scrutiny of orders. For instance, the amendments would allow separate Committees to perform procedural matters and the task of reporting on the substance of a draft order. It seems appropriate for the scrutiny of orders to be performed by a single Committee, which would make best use of the understanding of an order built up by a Committee. The Government have assumed that the Regulatory Reform Committee in the House of Commons and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in another place will continue to perform those roles, but I stress that those matters are for the House and that, in principle, there would be no objection to other Committees with expert knowledge being involved in the scrutiny of draft orders.</p><p><a name="06051719000131">As hon. Members know, it has been agreed to expand the remit of the Regulatory Reform Committee. The Government expect it to be appropriate for Standing Orders to reflect the potential need for the Committee to seek expert views from other  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 926</b><br>Committees on particularly complex orders. As noted, that is ultimately an issue for Parliament to decide.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002569">8 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000132">Hon. Members have also tabled amendments that would remove provision for the House to overturn a veto exercised by its responsible Committee. To provide that a Committee decision could override the opinion of the House would be an unprecedented step that ultimately could be unworkable in practice. In new clause 14, however, hon. Members suggest a mechanism for the House of Commons to exercise a veto, whereby if a certain percentage of MPs objected to an order in writing, that order would have to be withdrawn. That percentage is set at 10 per cent.</p><p><a name="06051719000133">The Government are committed to ensuring that the procedural safeguards in the Bill are robust and effective. However, the amendments would create a somewhat arbitrary arrangement which, crucially, does not build on the strength of the existing system for scrutinising orders&#151;namely, the detailed scrutiny given to orders by the specialist Committees. In any case, under the affirmative and super-affirmative procedure, a proposal must, following Committee scrutiny, pass to the House for affirmative resolution. Some hon. Members suggested that the House is excluded from these matters, but that is wide of the mark.</p><p><a name="06051719000134">There was then a discussion on proposals for a two-year rule whereby once an order had been vetoed a Minister could not table a similar order for the next two years. I understand the reasoning behind those amendments. They seek to ensure that a veto system cannot be abused by a future Government, a point with which I have considerable sympathy, and which ultimately constitutes the rationale for Government amendments to introduce a veto into the Bill. However, we would want to avoid imposing an arbitrary restriction on the order-making process, and I am concerned that the amendments may do precisely that.</p><p><a name="06051719000135">New clause 6 proposes that where either House decides within 21 days that an order is inappropriate for delivery under the order-making power, it should be the subject matter of primary legislation. That arrangement could be difficult to operate. The Cabinet Committee on the Legislative Programme takes decisions each year on which proposals the Government will take forward by primary legislation. As provided for in clause 12, the explanatory document will describe to Parliament why a proposal is suitable for delivery by order. The legislative programme is carefully planned, and adequate resources need to be in place to take forward a Bill. A procedure such as this, whereby an order could suddenly be translated into primary legislation, could cause unmanageable uncertainty and potentially create a very overcrowded legislative programme. I hope that hon. Members accept that we could not support such an amendment. </p><p><a name="06051719000136">The Government recognise&#151;this was touched upon&#151;that there are issues surrounding the level of procedural detail that should be contained in statute and in Standing Orders. The Procedure Committee, for instance, has recommended that as far as possible the procedural requirements for scrutiny of orders should be left to House authorities. I have provided assurance that the Government will continue a dialogue with the  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 927</b><br>Chairs of the relevant Committees about appropriate changes to Standing Orders, and I have confirmed, and am happy to confirm again, my intention to listen to views on this issue.</p><p><a name="06051719000137">Our priority is to get the Bill right, to have a workable system of scrutiny, and to achieve the right balance between creating a power that is able to deliver the regulatory reform agenda and ensuring that effective and robust safeguards are in place. The veto clearly plays an important role in achieving that balance. The Government are confident that in the veto provided we have the substantial and workable safeguard that Committees have requested. However, we will continue to listen to views on the most appropriate form that the veto should take, both during the passage of the Bill and in relation to amendments to Standing Orders once the Bill has been passed.</p><p><a name="06051719000138"><b><a name="06051719002615">Mr. Gale</b><i>rose&#151;</i></p><p><a name="06051719000139"><b><a name="06051719002616">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b> Order.

We say that there must be safeguards and that there are not enough safeguards in the Bill as it stands, not least as regards the promised veto, which turns out in practice not to be a veto. I hear the Minister&#146;s offer of further consultation; we shall see. In the meantime, we had expected that a full and restrictive veto should be given to Select Committees, and we still expect that.

order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I do not want to detain the House, but during the debate on the last group of amendments, I am fairly certain that I understood the Minister to respond to the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) by saying that it would be regrettable if a Select Committee were referred for judicial review. That is on the record. However, it is my understanding that Select Committees and the whole House are the subjects and beneficiaries of parliamentary privilege and could not be referred for judicial review.

The new clause deals with the capacity conferred by the Bill to delegate the function of legislation. It is, at first sight, a rather extraordinary concept&#151;the idea that Ministers might, by Order in Council, confer to any other person the function of legislating. Of course, delegated functions already occur through primary legislation in a number of cases, but when we asked Ministers&#151;in Committee and elsewhere&#151;exactly what they meant by the provision in the Bill, I have to say that the answers were less than convincing and less than adequate. There is no clear idea of why there is a need for Ministers to defer through an Order in Council what is the most important aspect of Parliament&#146;s work&#151;the legislative function&#151;to any other person. There is, I accept, an argument for allowing the function of levying fees or changing a fees regime to be delegated to another person, which is why we have framed our new clause in a different way from the amendment that we tabled in Committee, and why it does not deal with that issue.</p><p><a name="06051719000977">We would have liked a full debate on this subject yesterday in the context of new clause 19, but as you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, our procedure yesterday did not entirely allow for that. The new provision was originally in clause 2, but now lies in new clause 19 and the subsequent new clauses. We would have liked at that point to move amendments reducing the capacity to delegate the function of legislating, and to have divided the House on them.</p><p><a name="06051719000978">Two things alarm us. First, we have to ask whether it is right to give, through secondary legislation, the legislative function to another person&#151;whomsoever that may be&#151;who is not a legislator; not a Member of this Parliament. The second and most relevant question is that even if one accepts the need to delegate the legislative function&#151;which I do not&#151;why on earth is the legislation that such a person can then create via the delegated power not subject to the same caveats to which the Minister who conferred that delegated function is subject? Why, moreover, is such legislation not subject to the same parliamentary protections&#151;albeit inadequate, as we have just been debating&#151;to which it would have been subject, had it been put through the House via secondary legislation?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 936</b><br><p><a name="06051719000979">The case is absolutely unanswerable. I am prepared to listen to arguments from the Minister on the need to delegate a legislative function, although I am still at a loss to know in exactly what circumstances such a power would be used. However, I will not accept, under any circumstances, that such a power should not be subject to the same restrictions, caveats and the so-called veto that we have applied to matters properly before legislators: in other words, Members of this House acting in a legislative capacity in a Select Committee or in a Statutory Instrument Committee.</p><p><a name="06051719000980">The suggestion is entirely preposterous. I know that we sometimes seem to defer our legislative functions to all sorts of people, but at least we try to maintain the fig leaf whereby we legislate in this House on the basis of information that we have. Ministers will be allowed to wash their hands completely of legislation that is the product of this provision. They will not be interested in whether it complies with the regulatory principles or falls within the narrow constraints on Ministers&#146; ability to delegate through such means, which we have just been discussing.</p><p><a name="06051719000981">We must remember that we are talking about amendment to primary legislation. Primary legislation will go through all its parliamentary stages and, a few years later, a Minister will be able to say, &#147;I&#146;m going to amend this legislation, but I&#146;m not going to tell you how. I&#146;m going to delegate that function to another person whom the House does not know and whose capacity they do not know, in order that they can make amendments that the House does not know about, and which will never go back to the House for corroboration or scrutiny.&#148;</p><p><a name="06051719000982">I do not think that that is the way that the House should do its business. It is an error of judgment. I know that the Minister will say, &#147;It&#146;s nothing to worry about. We&#146;re only talking about a few learned bodies and things like that, and they must be allowed to make their own rules,&#148; but I do worry about it&#151;that is my job. It is the job of all hon. Members to worry about whether we allow other people to make legislation on our behalf without the appropriate restrictions.</p><p><a name="06051719000983">The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee, also has amendments in this group. From his body language, it is clear that he shares some of our concerns and that he is itching to speak. Given the abbreviated time available I shall not delay the House, save to say that amendments Nos. 5 and 9 fall, as they apply to something that yesterday was deleted from the Bill by a decision of the House. However, new clause 15 is still relevant as it sets out the principles that should apply in this matter and would restrict the capacity to delegate the legislative function.</p><p><a name="06051719000984">I hope that we will get satisfactory answers from the Minister, but I expect that he will not be able to satisfy my concerns as he has not put forward his own amendments to bring the delegated legislative function within the compass of his constraints. It is likely that I shall wish to divide the House, but I hope to get some support from other parties.</p><p><a name="06051719000985">Conservative Members who share my concerns may feel put off because the new clause refers to the veto. They were unable to support that proposal earlier, but it has now been disposed of. This is an important issue and we must send the clearest possible message to the  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 937</b><br>other place that it requires appropriate amendment. For members of the principal Opposition party to sit on their hands in respect of such an important matter would be extremely unhelpful, and I entreat them to show their support in the Lobbies, whatever their reservations about one small aspect of the new clause.</p><p><a name="06051719000986"><b><a name="06051719003436">Andrew Miller:</b> In view of the time, I shall be extremely brief. I wish to move the two amendments in my name, which fill the gap&#151;</p><p><a name="06051719000987"><b><a name="06051719003437">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman does not have to move his amendments, but merely speak to the group.</p><p><a name="06051719000988"><b><a name="06051719003438">Andrew Miller:</b> Amendment No. 7 would change the default position and ensure that the positive and negative procedures that apply to Ministers would also apply to any grantee of the power to legislate, unless an exception applied as set out in amendment No. 8.</p><p><a name="06051719000989">I shall give the House practical examples of how that would work. The North Western and North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee is made up of local authority appointees and others, including lay persons. It has been involved in long and complicated machinations about illegal cockle fishing on the Dee estuary with the Environment Agency Wales. A regulating order has been passed, but it needed the authority of the EAW and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It would be intolerable if such a body could regulate on its own. I do not believe that that was the Minister&#146;s intention, or that of his predecessor, in drafting the order and my amendments are merely intended to help to resolve the situation. I could give further examples, but in view of the time and the fact that it is essential that we hear from the Minister on this important point, I shall conclude my remarks.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002570">8.45 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000990"><b><a name="06051719003439">Mr. Heald:</b> The original Bill attracted widespread criticism because it allowed such wide sub-delegation. Throughout our proceedings, the Opposition and, indeed, the Liberal Democrats, have tried to frame amendments in a way that might lure the Minister into accepting them. We did not get far in Committee, but things are going a bit better now, so I hope that the Minister might at least give us some assurances about later stages of the Bill in the other place.</p><p><a name="06051719000991">I accept that there could be one sub-delegation to achieve the mergers that we were talking about yesterday in respect of the Hampton review, where it might be necessary to allow sub-delegation to a regulator&#151;a point that I discussed with the Minister&#146;s predecessor in Committee. However, to allow the possibility for continuous, chain sub-delegation, whereby there is sub-delegation to one person who has the power to make secondary legislation, including the power to sub-delegate again, and so on, is a bit much&#151;or a lot too much. New clause 15 is aimed at that situation. I support the idea that there should be a limit to the amount of sub-delegation&#151;the length of the chain.</p><p><a name="06051719000992">The point that there should be proper consultation before the use of secondary legislation for such purposes is well taken, so although, as the hon.  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 938</b><br>Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) rightly pointed out, I have reservations about subsection (2) of the new clause, given that the House did not vote for the provision that a veto by a specified number of Members of the House should be added to the Bill, I do not feel constrained by that technical point in supporting the new clause. We certainly support the new clause and I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to it.</p><p><a name="06051719000993"><b><a name="06051719003440">Mr. McFadden:</b> I was pleased to hear that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) accede to the case for sub-delegation in some circumstances. The question before us is twofold. New clause 15 suggests that those to whom powers are sub-delegated should be subject to the same parliamentary processes as a Minister making an order. Powers to legislate are already exercised by entities other than Ministers in situations where statutory instruments are not always appropriate&#151;for example, there are local authority powers to make byelaws that are not subject to any parliamentary procedure, but instead have to be authorised by the Secretary of State and must have set model procedures. The conditions set out in the new clause would not cater for those powers and as a result would require extensive public consultation and parliamentary time when that would often be inappropriate or unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06051719000994"><b><a name="06051719003441">David Howarth:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p><p><a name="06051719000995"><b><a name="06051719003442">Mr. McFadden:</b> Given the time available, I would rather make some progress.</p><p><a name="06051719000996">When making an order that confers a power to legislate, the nature of that power will be considered on a case-by-case basis and the order will set out the appropriate procedural requirements, depending on whom the power is conferred and its subject matter. That is the best approach, rather than being too rigid.</p><p><a name="06051719000997">In our short debate, there was a question about whether someone could &#147;sell on&#148; the power sub-delegated to them. No, they would not be able to do so.</p><p><a name="06051719000998"><b><a name="06051719003443">Mark Fisher (Stoke-on-Trent, Central) (Lab):</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><p><a name="06051719000999"><b><a name="06051719003444">Mr. McFadden:</b> I should like to press on.</p><p><a name="06051719001000">Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), do not suggest that sub-delegation should not happen. He attempts to produce a list that defines to whom the phrase &#147;any person&#148; might apply. As with his contributions throughout these debates, there is much sense in what he suggests. There are various instances in which powers to legislate are exercised by bodies other than Ministers, and he has attempted to define some of them in amendment No. 8 and in his contribution. We do not propose to accept those amendments tonight, but I can tell him that the effort to define the term &#147;any person&#148; more clearly is something that we hope to reflect on, consider and return to, as the Bill makes progress in another place.</p><p><a name="06051719001001"><b><a name="06051719003445">Mark Fisher:</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 939</b><br><p><a name="06051719001002"><b><a name="06051719003446">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

If the provision in the Bill that sub-delegates the power to legislate in the first place were to include the possibility of further sub-delegation, and that was part of the original order, there is no reason to believe that further selling on of the power to legislate should be excluded.</p><p><a name="06051719001008"><b><a name="06051719003451">Mark Fisher:</b> That is a fair point, but it does not address my point about where that is dealt with in the Bill.

In the case of our Bill, explicit wording would be needed to authorise further delegation of legislative powers. Given that the Bill does not contain such provision, such further delegation would not be possible. The Bill does not say so in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p><p><a name="06051719001015"><b><a name="06051719003458">Mark Fisher:</b> I hope that the Minister is right, but it is very worrying that this is a fundamental parliamentary principle and we have moments before the knife falls on the debate. There is no point in discussing that, but such things should not just be rubbed through like that and the House and the other place must return to these things not in a gabbled way under the edge of a knife falling on the debate, but in a serious way. I am sure that the Minister intends to justify the position, and I hope that he can do so with his mastery of the footnote. However, as things stand, I am more persuaded by what the hon. Member for Cambridge said from a sedentary position. He feels that there are problems. These matters are too serious to buff through.</p><p><a name="06051719001016"><b><a name="06051719003459">John Hemming (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</b> The key point is that if there is a statutory instrument or order under the Bill that enables sub-delegation, sub-delegation can ensue. Only if the original Bill contained a provision saying that there could not be sub-delegation would that be, subject to judicial review, ultra vires. That is what we are asking for.</p><p><a name="06051719001017"><b><a name="06051719003460">Mark Fisher:</b> I am afraid that these issues are too nice&#151;in the true sense of the word&#151;to tease out in three and a half minutes, but they are very important and we are going to have to come back to them. We cannot allow this legislation finally to pass on to the statute book without being clear about what we are doing. The Minister may be clear and he may well be right. He has earned the right to our confidence. He has shown that during the debate today and yesterday. However, we cannot afford to give him the benefit of the doubt. He has to justify that to the House. We have to be extremely careful about what sub-delegation we are making.</p><p><a name="06051719001018"><b><a name="06051719003461">Rob Marris:</b> In terms of what the Minister said in response to amendments Nos. 7 and 8, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), can the Minister assure me&#151;I was not clear from what he said&#151;that he was minded to accept the spirit, if not the wording, of those amendments?</p><p><a name="06051719001019"><b><a name="06051719003462">Mr. Heath:</b> That was a short, but informative debate. I agree that the Minister has been doing a good job in rather disadvantageous conditions over the past two days. I hope that next time he comes before the House with a Bill, he has a better Bill to work with. His officials are rather over-reliant on interpretations from Halsbury and insufficiently prepared to look at the common sense of what is written in the statute. Quite  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 941</b><br>clearly there is no exclusion in the statute in relation to sub-delegation&#151;a quite proper matter for the House&#146;s concern.</p><p><a name="06051719001020">The idea that the requirements on consultation, which are contained in clause 11, are an unsatisfactorily onerous duty for somebody who is legislating under a delegated function is quite wrong. If someone is making legislation that is binding on other people&#151;even if it is only a few people&#151;is it entirely improper that they should consult such organisations as appear to them</p><a name="06051719002566"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;to be representative of interests substantially affected by the proposals&#148;?</p></ul><p><a name="06051719001021">I would suggest not. It is proper for delegated functions of legislation to fall within exactly the same constraints and to have exactly the same terms of consultation and procedures as any other matter handled under the accelerated procedure.</p><p><a name="06051719001022">We still have some very big question marks&#151;notwithstanding the Minister&#146;s preparedness to talk to the Committee and perhaps bring forward further proposals at the next stage of the consideration of the Bill in another place. Who knows, he may bring forward things that are of interest at that point, but that will not happen before this House today and, on that basis, we must seek the advice of the House, and I will press new clause 15 to a vote.</p><p><a name="06051719001023"><b><a name="06051719003463">Mr. Greg Knight:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Will you confirm that parts 2 and 3 of this very important Bill will remain unscrutinised on Report and that that disgraceful state of affairs arises only because of the terms of the Government&#146;s own guillotine motion?</p><p><a name="06051719001024"><b><a name="06051719003464">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> I can confirm only that it begins to look extremely improbable that the other parts of the Bill are going to receive consideration.</p><p><a name="06051719001025"><i>Question put, </i>That the clause be read a Second time:&#151;</p><br><i>The House divided:</i> Ayes 200, Noes 259.<center><a

The new clause deals with the capacity conferred by the Bill to delegate the function of legislation. It is, at first sight, a rather extraordinary concept&#151;the idea that Ministers might, by Order in Council, confer to any other person the function of legislating. Of course, delegated functions already occur through primary legislation in a number of cases, but when we asked Ministers&#151;in Committee and elsewhere&#151;exactly what they meant by the provision in the Bill, I have to say that the answers were less than convincing and less than adequate. There is no clear idea of why there is a need for Ministers to defer through an Order in Council what is the most important aspect of Parliament&#146;s work&#151;the legislative function&#151;to any other person. There is, I accept, an argument for allowing the function of levying fees or changing a fees regime to be delegated to another person, which is why we have framed our new clause in a different way from the amendment that we tabled in Committee, and why it does not deal with that issue.</p><p><a name="06051719000977">We would have liked a full debate on this subject yesterday in the context of new clause 19, but as you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, our procedure yesterday did not entirely allow for that. The new provision was originally in clause 2, but now lies in new clause 19 and the subsequent new clauses. We would have liked at that point to move amendments reducing the capacity to delegate the function of legislating, and to have divided the House on them.</p><p><a name="06051719000978">Two things alarm us. First, we have to ask whether it is right to give, through secondary legislation, the legislative function to another person&#151;whomsoever that may be&#151;who is not a legislator; not a Member of this Parliament. The second and most relevant question is that even if one accepts the need to delegate the legislative function&#151;which I do not&#151;why on earth is the legislation that such a person can then create via the delegated power not subject to the same caveats to which the Minister who conferred that delegated function is subject? Why, moreover, is such legislation not subject to the same parliamentary protections&#151;albeit inadequate, as we have just been debating&#151;to which it would have been subject, had it been put through the House via secondary legislation?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 936</b><br><p><a name="06051719000979">The case is absolutely unanswerable. I am prepared to listen to arguments from the Minister on the need to delegate a legislative function, although I am still at a loss to know in exactly what circumstances such a power would be used. However, I will not accept, under any circumstances, that such a power should not be subject to the same restrictions, caveats and the so-called veto that we have applied to matters properly before legislators: in other words, Members of this House acting in a legislative capacity in a Select Committee or in a Statutory Instrument Committee.</p><p><a name="06051719000980">The suggestion is entirely preposterous. I know that we sometimes seem to defer our legislative functions to all sorts of people, but at least we try to maintain the fig leaf whereby we legislate in this House on the basis of information that we have. Ministers will be allowed to wash their hands completely of legislation that is the product of this provision. They will not be interested in whether it complies with the regulatory principles or falls within the narrow constraints on Ministers&#146; ability to delegate through such means, which we have just been discussing.</p><p><a name="06051719000981">We must remember that we are talking about amendment to primary legislation. Primary legislation will go through all its parliamentary stages and, a few years later, a Minister will be able to say, &#147;I&#146;m going to amend this legislation, but I&#146;m not going to tell you how. I&#146;m going to delegate that function to another person whom the House does not know and whose capacity they do not know, in order that they can make amendments that the House does not know about, and which will never go back to the House for corroboration or scrutiny.&#148;</p><p><a name="06051719000982">I do not think that that is the way that the House should do its business. It is an error of judgment. I know that the Minister will say, &#147;It&#146;s nothing to worry about. We&#146;re only talking about a few learned bodies and things like that, and they must be allowed to make their own rules,&#148; but I do worry about it&#151;that is my job. It is the job of all hon. Members to worry about whether we allow other people to make legislation on our behalf without the appropriate restrictions.</p><p><a name="06051719000983">The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), the Chairman of the Regulatory Reform Committee, also has amendments in this group. From his body language, it is clear that he shares some of our concerns and that he is itching to speak. Given the abbreviated time available I shall not delay the House, save to say that amendments Nos. 5 and 9 fall, as they apply to something that yesterday was deleted from the Bill by a decision of the House. However, new clause 15 is still relevant as it sets out the principles that should apply in this matter and would restrict the capacity to delegate the legislative function.</p><p><a name="06051719000984">I hope that we will get satisfactory answers from the Minister, but I expect that he will not be able to satisfy my concerns as he has not put forward his own amendments to bring the delegated legislative function within the compass of his constraints. It is likely that I shall wish to divide the House, but I hope to get some support from other parties.</p><p><a name="06051719000985">Conservative Members who share my concerns may feel put off because the new clause refers to the veto. They were unable to support that proposal earlier, but it has now been disposed of. This is an important issue and we must send the clearest possible message to the  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 937</b><br>other place that it requires appropriate amendment.

The North Western and North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee is made up of local authority appointees and others, including lay persons. It has been involved in long and complicated machinations about illegal cockle fishing on the Dee estuary with the Environment Agency Wales. A regulating order has been passed, but it needed the authority of the EAW and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It would be intolerable if such a body could regulate on its own. I do not believe that that was the Minister&#146;s intention, or that of his predecessor, in drafting the order and my amendments are merely intended to help to resolve the situation. I could give further examples, but in view of the time and the fact that it is essential that we hear from the Minister on this important point, I shall conclude my remarks.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051719002570">8.45 pm</h5><p><a name="06051719000990"><b><a name="06051719003439">Mr. Heald:</b> The original Bill attracted widespread criticism because it allowed such wide sub-delegation. Throughout our proceedings, the Opposition and, indeed, the Liberal Democrats, have tried to frame amendments in a way that might lure the Minister into accepting them. We did not get far in Committee, but things are going a bit better now, so I hope that the Minister might at least give us some assurances about later stages of the Bill in the other place.</p><p><a name="06051719000991">I accept that there could be one sub-delegation to achieve the mergers that we were talking about yesterday in respect of the Hampton review, where it might be necessary to allow sub-delegation to a regulator&#151;a point that I discussed with the Minister&#146;s predecessor in Committee. However, to allow the possibility for continuous, chain sub-delegation, whereby there is sub-delegation to one person who has the power to make secondary legislation, including the power to sub-delegate again, and so on, is a bit much&#151;or a lot too much. New clause 15 is aimed at that situation. I support the idea that there should be a limit to the amount of sub-delegation&#151;the length of the chain.</p><p><a name="06051719000992">The point that there should be proper consultation before the use of secondary legislation for such purposes is well taken, so although, as the hon.  <br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 938</b><br>Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) rightly pointed out, I have reservations about subsection (2) of the new clause, given that the House did not vote for the provision that a veto by a specified number of Members of the House should be added to the Bill, I do not feel constrained by that technical point in supporting the new clause. We certainly support the new clause and I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to it.</p><p><a name="06051719000993"><b><a name="06051719003440">Mr. McFadden:</b> I was pleased to hear that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) accede to the case for sub-delegation in some circumstances. The question before us is twofold. New clause 15 suggests that those to whom powers are sub-delegated should be subject to the same parliamentary processes as a Minister making an order. Powers to legislate are already exercised by entities other than Ministers in situations where statutory instruments are not always appropriate&#151;for example, there are local authority powers to make byelaws that are not subject to any parliamentary procedure, but instead have to be authorised by the Secretary of State and must have set model procedures. The conditions set out in the new clause would not cater for those powers and as a result would require extensive public consultation and parliamentary time when that would often be inappropriate or unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06051719000994"><b><a name="06051719003441">David Howarth:</b> Will the hon.

That is the best approach, rather than being too rigid.</p><p><a name="06051719000997">In our short debate, there was a question about whether someone could &#147;sell on&#148; the power sub-delegated to them. No, they would not be able to do so.</p><p><a name="06051719000998"><b><a name="06051719003443">Mark Fisher (Stoke-on-Trent, Central) (Lab):</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><p><a name="06051719000999"><b><a name="06051719003444">Mr. McFadden:</b> I should like to press on.</p><p><a name="06051719001000">Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), do not suggest that sub-delegation should not happen. He attempts to produce a list that defines to whom the phrase &#147;any person&#148; might apply. As with his contributions throughout these debates, there is much sense in what he suggests. There are various instances in which powers to legislate are exercised by bodies other than Ministers, and he has attempted to define some of them in amendment No. 8 and in his contribution. We do not propose to accept those amendments tonight, but I can tell him that the effort to define the term &#147;any person&#148; more clearly is something that we hope to reflect on, consider and return to, as the Bill makes progress in another place.</p><p><a name="06051719001001"><b><a name="06051719003445">Mark Fisher:</b> Will the Minister give way?</p><br><notus-date day="16" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>16 May 2006 : Column 939</b><br><p><a name="06051719001002"><b><a name="06051719003446">Mr. Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

There is no point in discussing that, but such things should not just be rubbed through like that and the House and the other place must return to these things not in a gabbled way under the edge of a knife falling on the debate, but in a serious way. I am sure that the Minister intends to justify the position, and I hope that he can do so with his mastery of the footnote. However, as things stand, I am more persuaded by what the hon.

He has earned the right to our confidence. He has shown that during the debate today and yesterday. However, we cannot afford to give him the benefit of the doubt.

We have had a good and full debate on that, and the Government have made it clear that although we want to find an approach that does not place too much emphasis on our perception of how Parliament should act, we do not want to avoid the responsibility that Ministers must face in terms of how they behave.

It was not even the Bill on which the Government consulted. The proposals on which they consulted were very different. There has been a constant battle to try to get a Bill that really tackles deregulation, because we certainly need one&#151;my goodness, we do.

I tabled all the amendments suggested by the Regulatory Reform Committee and many suggested by other Committees of the House. All were rejected; the then Minister used to described them as debating points. Recently, however, common sense has been brought to bear on the problems and there has been a climbdown. I welcome new clauses 19 and 20, but they came so late in the day that we have not been able to tackle all the problems with the provisions. We still have issues about how to tackle the problems of small business and how to filter Law Commission Bills so that the most controversial are properly debated. We still have issues about the procedures to be adopted to give the House a veto.</p><p><a name="06051719002554">There are great time pressures tonight, so I cannot explain all the reasons why the Bill is not yet ready to become law, but I cannot stomach the idea that it should go to the other place with the approval of the Opposition.</p><p><a name="06051719002555"><b><a name="06051719004872">Mr. Gummer:</b> In the short time that my hon.

They will not be limited by a very tight definition of legal &#147;burdens&#148;&#151;a matter that I know that the House has explored in some depth.</p><p><a name="06051719002541">The better regulation initiatives that this order-making power will allow us to deliver include the consolidation of legislation to make it easier to understand and work with, and the reduction or removal of administrative burdens such as form filling or requirements to give information.

We have had a good and full debate on that, and the Government have made it clear that although we want to find an approach that does not place too much emphasis on our perception of how Parliament should act, we do not want to avoid the responsibility that Ministers must face in terms of how they behave.

It was not even the Bill on which the Government consulted. The proposals on which they consulted were very different. There has been a constant battle to try to get a Bill that really tackles deregulation, because we certainly need one&#151;my goodness, we do. With a Government who are passing 15 regulations a day and increasing the burdens on business, whose extra costs are &#163;50 billion since 1997, we need a Bill&#151;but not a bad one.</p><p><a name="06051719002553">We struggled in Committee. I tabled all the amendments suggested by the Regulatory Reform Committee and many suggested by other Committees of the House. All were rejected; the then Minister used to described them as debating points. Recently, however, common sense has been brought to bear on the problems and there has been a climbdown. I welcome new clauses 19 and 20, but they came so late in the day that we have not been able to tackle all the problems with the provisions. We still have issues about how to tackle the problems of small business and how to filter Law Commission Bills so that the most controversial are properly debated. We still have issues about the procedures to be adopted to give the House a veto.</p><p><a name="06051719002554">There are great time pressures tonight, so I cannot explain all the reasons why the Bill is not yet ready to become law, but I cannot stomach the idea that it should go to the other place with the approval of the Opposition.</p><p><a name="06051719002555"><b><a name="06051719004872">Mr. Gummer:</b> In the short time that my hon.
