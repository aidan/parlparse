  Well, that is a bit disappointing because 27&nbsp;per cent. of the population cannot get digital terrestrial services but they pay 100&nbsp;per cent. of the licence fee. If that state of affairs were to continue for a year or two, that would perhaps be acceptable, but, with digital analogue switchover to be completed by 2012, that is asking an awful lot of people who cannot get digital services.
