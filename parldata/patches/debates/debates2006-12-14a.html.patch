 <p><a name="stpa_o254"><a name="61214-0016.htm_para6"><a name="06121474000690">The question is whether we can negotiate to reassert natural control in terms of the fisheries policy of the European Union. First, is that desirable? I say it is. The Conservatives used to say it is. They are currently in limbo. Secondly, can it be done? We would have to establish whether there was support from other Europeans for such a policy. I therefore turn to the proceedings of the Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament of 11 January 2005&#151;a committee across the member states, which overwhelmingly passed an amendment to remove exclusive competence over fisheries from the putative European constitution, indicating a substantial measure&#151;a wave&#151;of dissatisfaction with the results and consequences of the common fisheries policy across the European Union.</p>
