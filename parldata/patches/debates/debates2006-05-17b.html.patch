Ultimately, I want devolution to take place, but I recognise, on all these matters, that it will only take place with the confidence of both sides of the community. I have put in place mechanisms in the amendments so that if Sinn Fein and others in the nationalist community sign up to policing and the conditions arise to devolve criminal justice and policing in due course, that will be done if the Assembly, along with the Secretary of the State and the House, want it.</p><p><a name="06051798000041"><b><a name="06051798000114">Rev.

He knows very well that the IMC report was unequivocal in its condemnation of the Ulster Volunteer Force. Three paragraphs of the report spell out that it is a terrorist body and is engaged in terrorism. How, then, can he say that there is a difference between the activity of Sinn Fein and the activity of the UVF, and that because the official Unionist party has gone into a coalition with the UVF spokesman, it is in a weaker position? We cannot balance aspects of terrorism. Terrorism is terrorism. It is not possible to say that one part is a bit weaker than another.

I would simply say that my right hon.

I have not seen his remarks, but my understanding of what he said today is that there needs to be the same movement from Continuity IRA and Real IRA, the dissident republicans, and there needs to be the same movement from those loyalist groups that are currently not on ceasefire and are undertaking activity that has led to the deaths of a number of individuals over the12 months that I have held this office.

Community halls, Orange halls, halls used by the Ancient Order of Hibernians and other types of hall recently gained exemption from rates in Northern Ireland. That move was widely welcomed throughout the community as beneficial for local communities. It relieved a major financial burden for those who run such halls on both sides of the community: on the Unionist side and on the nationalist side. Under the new clause, those halls would also be subject to subsection 4 of the criminal damage compensation provisions, rather than subsection 5. That would bring them into line with agricultural premises.</p><p><a name="06051798000049">Other properties have to prove, for the purposes of getting compensation from the Northern Ireland Office, that three or more people were involved in an attack or commission of an offence that resulted in damage to premises, or the Chief Constable has to issue a certificate indicating that it was carried out by a proscribed organisation. Agricultural premises, on the other hand, are not subject to such stringent provisions. In that case, if the act is deemed to have been carried out maliciously or wantonly, that alone is the condition that applies and compensation is payable. </p><p><a name="06051798000050">Through their recent derating provisions, the Government have recognised the valuable role played by the halls that we are talking about&#151;community halls, Orange halls, halls used by those in the nationalist community. They provide an invaluable community resource. That applies to urban areas, but it is particularly applicable to rural areas. Lest we run away with the idea that the proposal would only benefit  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1052</b><br>people who run those halls, many of them, like parish halls throughout the United Kingdom, are used for a wide range of purposes. In Northern Ireland, they are used by credit unions, community groups and youth services for a vast array of community activities, and their use has expanded a great deal in recent years. The removal of a large financial burden following the introduction of derating was welcomed in Northern Ireland, and I congratulate the Government on taking on board the proposal, which we pressed strongly in our discussions and negotiations with them.</p><p><a name="06051798000051">Insurance is even more financially crippling for those halls than the rates levied on them. Orange halls often make their own provision, which is very costly, because many insurance companies refuse to offer cover for community halls, particularly Orange halls. The cover that is available is extremely expensive, because of the number and extent of sectarian attacks suffered by the halls and the problems that they face in obtaining compensation for such attacks. Sometimes, people seeking insurance for an Orange hall approached more than 30 different companies before finding one that provides cover, and even then at an exorbitant price. They sometimes have to pay four-figure sums for insurance that would cost &#163;100 or &#163;150 in Scotland and England, which is a massive difference. There have been dozens of sectarian attacks in recent years, particularly on Orange halls, which have suffered extensive damage and, in many cases, been razed to the ground. Those attacks are usually carried out in the dead of night, with few witnesses, and they deprive a local community of an invaluable resource.</p><p><a name="06051798000052"><b><a name="06051798000117">Lady Hermon:</b> I support very strongly the new clause tabled by the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. He will have noticed that the Minister expressed support for the Government document, &#147;A Shared Future&#148;. Would it not be helpful if the Government did not just talk the talk but walked the walk and supported the proposal, which usefully acknowledges the traditions and cultures not just of the Orange Order but of the Ancient Order of Hibernian?</p><p><a name="06051798000053"><b><a name="06051798000118">Mr. Dodds:</b> I very much welcome the hon. Lady&#146;s support. She is quite right. The case for the halls has been made, and the argument has been won, as evidenced by the fact that the Government decided exceptionally to introduce derating for the halls only a few months ago. The principle and precedent have been established: the new clause would simply remove a major financial burden that has an even greater impact than rates, so I hope that the Minister has it in his gift to respond positively to the proposal.</p><p><a name="06051798000054"><b><a name="06051798000119">Mr. Peter Robinson:</b> My hon. Friend is making a powerful case&#151;one so compelling that no reasonable Minister could resist it. The fact that compensation is not paid after halls are destroyed makes them all the more a target. In the sectarian attacks that have taken place, there is the knowledge that the responsibility and the cost will be borne directly by the Orangemen or the Ancient Order of Hibernians concerned. That makes it much more attractive because the perpetrators know the pain that will result from the attack.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1053</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051798000086">4 pm</h5><p><a name="06051798000055"><b><a name="06051798000120">Mr. Dodds:</b> My hon. Friend has highlighted a significant aspect. Those who carry out the attacks see that they are hurting the Orange community directly. Those who attack other halls on the nationalist side are doing the same on that side. They are impacting directly on the community. That, as my hon. Friend points out, provides an incentive for further attacks. There is no greater incentive for the arsonists, vandals and hooligans who carry out the attacks than to see halls that they have attacked previously lying derelict and, in some cases, razed to the ground for months and in many cases years on end, as people struggle to get compensation from their insurers, if they have insurers, or from the Northern Ireland Office, which refuses to provide insurance. They have to resort to raising the funds themselves, which in many cases is virtually impossible.</p><p><a name="06051798000056">The way that the system operates is an incentive for arsonists to go on attacking isolated halls. I should draw the attention of the House to the areas affected. I have a list of the arson attacks on Orange halls. I do not have a complete list of all the halls that have been attacked throughout Northern Ireland, but last year there were attacks on three Orange halls in County Tyrone, two in County Down, another one in County Tyrone, one in County Antrim, one in Armagh, two in Belfast and another one in Armagh. The attacks are widespread throughout the Province and are having a major impact on local communities.</p><p><a name="06051798000057"><b><a name="06051798000121">Dr. McCrea:</b> The list that my hon. Friend read out reflects the fact that the halls often represent a small, and in the local area a minority, community. Local people therefore are not able to pay for the rebuilding of the hall. My hon. Friend mentioned halls that were attacked in Tyrone. Those were isolated Protestant communities in a large nationalist or republican area. The attack on the hall was an attack on the culture of a small minority community.</p><p><a name="06051798000058"><b><a name="06051798000122">Mr. Dodds:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Halls that have been targeted&#151;for example, in Castlederg, Strabane, Altnaveigh in Newry, and Whiterock in Belfast, near my constituency&#151;are all situated in areas where the Protestant Unionist community is very much in the minority. That is a feature of the preponderance of attacks that have taken place, though it is not exclusively the case. They are seen as attacks on vulnerable communities, depriving them of what is for many of them their only local community resource.</p><p><a name="06051798000059">I know that the Minister takes such matters very seriously. In recent months he has spent a long time looking into issues in deprived Unionist areas in particular, and deprived areas generally. He has spoken to many people in local communities in Belfast and in rural areas. I know that he has heard directly from many organisations, community groups and individuals who make extensive use of Orange halls and other halls, and who have told him how important it is that those facilities continue to be made available for local communities in their areas.</p><p><a name="06051798000060">The new clause is in line with the Government&#146;s recent derating of Orange halls, and it is all of a piece with the proposals announced by the Minister recently, when he  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1054</b><br>said that he was in the business of trying to bring about regeneration and give confidence to deprived Unionist and loyalist areas. If the Government were to adopt the amendment, it would be seen as a positive step in not only Unionist communities, but nationalist communities.</p><p><a name="06051798000061">The amendment would not cost the Government a considerable amount of money. They may say that we must not open the floodgates to large amounts of Government expenditure, but the fact that they have been prepared to move on the issue of the rates indicates that they recognise the issue.</p><p><a name="06051798000062">The Minister followed through on his consultation process in those communities with a &#163;33 million package, and something similar could be done to help communities in not only Belfast, but throughout Northern Ireland. The DUP welcomed that package, but we recognise that a lot of it was centred on deprived areas, particularly in Greater Belfast. We accept that the bulk of the most deprived areas are in Belfast, but we have also made the point that the process should not stop there and that more needs to be done for rural areas and the west of the Province. This is a tremendous opportunity for the Government to take that process forward and implement in a practical yet modest way a measure that would give a tremendous fillip to communities throughout Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="06051798000063">I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It is clear that the current regulations, which require proof that a hall has been attacked unlawfully, maliciously and wantonly by three or more persons unlawfully, riotously or tumultuously assembled, or as a result of an act committed maliciously by a person actingon behalf of or in connection with an unlawful association, are often unworkable, because in a huge number of cases it is impossible to prove that those conditions were met. Such attacks often take place in the dead of night in isolated areas. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the motivation behind attacks on community halls is sectarian, yet obtaining compensation for such an attack can, even when it is done successfully, be tortuous and involve extremely costly insurance premiums.</p><p><a name="06051798000064">Such premises should be categorised in the same way as agricultural premises, which have been categorised in Northern Ireland for the precise reasons that I have enunciated. Agricultural premises were targeted in the dead of night and, although everybody knew why it was happening, the matter could not be proved. Historically, the Government have recognised that certain types of buildings and premises deserve special categorisation, because they are in isolated areas and are difficult to protect and defend, and Unionist and nationalist halls across the community deserve to be placed in that category. I trust that the Minister will respond positively to the amendment.</p><p><a name="06051798000065"><b><a name="06051798000123">Lembit &#214;pik:</b> I want to add two thoughts to the remarks by the hon. Member for Belfast, North(Mr. Dodds). First, it seems that there is some justification for saying that in certain circumstances in which natural justice would point towards a compensation payout, such payouts have been prevented by the strictures outlined by the hon. Member for Belfast, North, because the conditions are difficult to prove. He cites the example of a rural and  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1055</b><br>isolated premises that might be subject to an arson attack. The same thing can happen in urban areas. Will the Minister outline his understanding of the extent to which this is a problem?</p><p><a name="06051798000066">My second concern is that it looks as though an accident of circumstance can mean that an attack in two different situations will lead to very different outcomes as regards compensation, through no fault of the person making the compensation claim. What is the Minister&#146;s view of that apparent double standard? I know that he would agree that it is an unintended consequence of the Bill, but it strikes me that the new clause could resolve the disparity. It would be terribly undesirable were compensation not to be paid out in some situations. I hope that he can either accept the new clause or provide clarity about what the Government regard as the best course of action to ensure that those in rural and isolated areas, or those who cannot prove the nature of an attack, are not treated as second-class citizens.</p><p><a name="06051798000067"><b><a name="06051798000124">Mr. Hanson:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds) for tabling his new clause.</p><p><a name="06051798000068">I start by utterly condemning any attacks or vandalism on Orange or Hibernian halls, or any other buildings used for meetings. Whether they are attacked as a matter of general vandalism or subject to an attack of a sectarian nature, that is unacceptable in a civilised society. I would urge, as would the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), that any individuals who had information about such attacks should take it to the police, who may be able to undertake prosecution. Those who carry out such attacks should face the full force of the law&#151;that is self-evident in a civilised society.</p><p><a name="06051798000069">Let me say to the hon. Member for Belfast, North in particular that the current criminal damage legislation is an important means of supporting individuals and groups who have suffered material loss over the period of conflict in Northern Ireland. Now that we are moving, I hope, to a more normal society, such attacks, particularly the sectarian ones, should be reduced. That will in due course have obvious implications for current criminal damage arrangements generally.</p><p><a name="06051798000070">The Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 is particular to Northern Ireland. As we all know, that is because of the particular problems faced by Northern Ireland at that time. Such legislation does not exist in other parts of the United Kingdom. I want to reflect on the future of such compensation schemes, particularly in the context of a changing Northern Ireland and the Government&#146;s national approach to compensation. Of course, I recognise the great hurt and pain that can be caused, be it by a small act of vandalism causing a broken window or something much more serious in the shape of an arson attack on an entire building. The Police Service of Northern Ireland takes such criminal acts very seriously and will use the full weight of the law to prosecute the perpetrators.</p><p><a name="06051798000071">Before turning to the new clause, I will respond to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), who asked me about the nature and number of such attacks. I recently answered a parliamentary question&#151;if it was  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1056</b><br>not me, it was my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for security&#151;which indicated that police figures show that over the past 15 years, attacks on Orange halls in particular have varied significantly. In 1997, therewere 41 attacks; in 2004, there were six attacks; and the provisional figure for 2005 was higher than that for 2004. That information gives no specifics on the nature of the attack&#151;it could be a broken window or a full arson attack on a building.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051798000087">4.15 pm</h5><p><a name="06051798000072">The new clause seeks to change article 4 of the Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which was drafted to meet specific conditions relating to agricultural property, particularly the absence of a Chief Constable&#146;s certificate where the damage was caused by those acting on behalf of an illegal organisation, or the evidence of the involvement of three or more persons.</p><p><a name="06051798000073">Claims for non-agricultural properties are covered under article 5 of the Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 and, where its conditions are satisfied, claimants can obtain compensation for damage to such property. A Chief Constable&#146;s certificate, or proof of the involvement of three or more persons or of an illegal organisation, are generally required as proof of liability in respect of claims for compensation. Where there is evidence of damage caused by civil disorder, for example, Orange halls can make claims under the provisions of the order. When claims are not met under compensation arrangements, they should fall under commercial insurance arrangements in the normal way. We are dealing here with the question of whether we should give compensation to Orange halls on a par with that given to agricultural buildings when there is no Chief Constable&#146;s certificate and no evidence of the involvement of three or more persons.</p><p><a name="06051798000074">The effect of the new clause would be to extend the category of properties falling under article 4, which was not intended for that purpose. The Government believe that, when a property is damaged and when there is no Chief Constable&#146;s certificate and no evidence of the involvement of three or more persons&#151;when the circumstances do not meet the evidential requirement of the legislation covering criminal damage compensation&#151;the normal route for seeking compensation, in Northern Ireland as in other parts of the United Kingdom, is through general property insurance.</p><p><a name="06051798000075">I recognise that there can be difficulties in obtaining insurance, and I have discussed this issue with the hon. Member for Belfast, North. The Orange Order is a powerful organisation in the fabric of Northern Ireland, however, and it represents an awful lot of individuals and organisations. I would hope that it could use its power to raise these issues with the insurance companies.</p><p><a name="06051798000076">I know that it will disappoint the hon. Gentleman that I am unable to accept his new clause today. The provisions relating to the specific circumstances of agricultural properties were made in 1977. There is an anomaly involved, as that is the only area that is covered. However, there is compensation available for circumstances involving collective discontent and disorder, and compensation can also be obtained with a Chief Constable&#146;s certificate or with evidence of the involvement of three or more people. I am unable to accept the new clause for those reasons.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1057</b><br><p><a name="06051798000077"><b><a name="06051798000125">Lady Hermon:</b> If the Minister is not prepared to accept the new clause, will he consider an alternative that would make things easier for organisations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians and, particularly, the Orange Order, which bears the brunt of these problems? Could not the Northern Ireland Office pay for CCTV cameras to be installed at the premises of such organisations, in order that they might gather the evidence themselves under the present scheme? Will the Minister agree to that?</p><p><a name="06051798000078"><b><a name="06051798000126">Mr. Hanson:</b> The hon. Lady will know that I have recently announced additional resources for CCTV cameras, and a competition for individual organisations to bid for such cameras. That is possible for any organisation to do, subject to their demonstrating that the cameras would be of benefit in the prevention of crime. In principle, there is nothing to preclude an organisation from bidding for CCTV cameras to cover Orange halls. I cannot, and nor would I wish to, fund CCTV cameras at every Orange hall site, because that would be an impractical way of implementing Government policy. However, in principle, there is nothing wrong with applications being made to that effect.</p><p><a name="06051798000079">The hon. Member for Belfast, North mentioned the significant investment of &#163;33 million in areas of deprivation, and we have also undertaken the derating of Orange halls, which has released significant resources to the organisation. I know that he and his party welcomed that move, having pressed for it. The Government supported that change, and considered it a positive move forward in releasing those resources to the Orange halls. I know that he will be disappointed that I cannot accept his new clause today, but I cannot. I have explained the reasons for my decision, and I hope that he will withdraw it on that basis.</p><p><a name="060517102000009"><b><a name="060517102000592">Mr. Dodds:</b> I have listened to the Minister&#146;s comments and I am disappointed that he does not feel able to accept the new clause or to take on board the suggestion made by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) that he might at least provide such halls with the opportunity to try to claim compensation&#151;as many of them do not have insurance&#151;by gathering evidence from CCTV.</p><p><a name="060517102000010"><b><a name="060517102000593">Mr. Hanson:</b> I emphasise again that if the Chief Constable offers certification to the effect that the damage was caused by disorder or other associated means, and if three or more people were involved, criminal compensation can be claimed. The problem only exists if fewer people were involved.</p><p><a name="060517102000011"><b><a name="060517102000594">Mr. Dodds:</b> I understand that that is the legal position, which is precisely the problem. That is why we have tabled the new clause. While we understand that three or more people must be involved in an attack for compensation to be payable, the difficulty is proving that three or more people were involved. We are talking about buildings that have clearly been destroyed for sectarian reasons and as part of a wider campaign, as has been happening for decades in Northern Ireland. It was for precisely that reason that the Government introduced an exception for agricultural premises in  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1058</b><br>section 4 of the 1997 order, to which the Minister referred. That accepted that, for certain types of premises, it would be difficult to provide proof.</p><p><a name="060517102000012">My party&#146;s suggestion is that the same criteria should apply in relation to halls&#151;primarily Orange halls, but also to nationalist halls such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians and others&#151;so that they are not crippled in that way and that local communities are not deprived of an extremely valuable resource, in many cases for years and sometimes for ever. All hon. Members recognise the valuable and important role that such parish halls play in our communities up and down the land, day in and day out.</p><p><a name="060517102000013"><b><a name="060517102000595">Lembit &#214;pik:</b> In that context, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Minister&#146;s position seems to step against normalisation, as he has created a double standard in relation to the burden of proof in some circumstances? I cannot see why the Minister is making such heavy weather of accepting a fairly common-sense proposal that provides proper and sensible protection in a way that cannot realistically be abused.</p><p><a name="060517102000014"><b><a name="060517102000596">Mr. Dodds:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I hope that his additional words, even at this late stage, will cause the Minister to think again. This short debate has illustrated a fairly strong consensus on the issue. Most people see the proposal as fairly modest.It is in line with Government policy, the recent announcement of a package of measures and the recent announcement on derating. It accepts that there are anomalies for certain types of premises. The proposal simply ensures that local communities will not be deprived.</p><p><a name="060517102000015">Finally, the Minister asked whether the owners of such halls, and the Orange Order in particular, could go to the insurers and talk to them. No doubt the Minister will be aware&#151;some of his colleagues should be, as the Orange Order has made this clear to Ministers in talks&#151;that this matter has been the subject of years of discussion and negotiation with insurers. The trouble is that those discussions are not getting anywhere. As a result, halls up and down the land either cannot get insurance any more or any insurance that is available to them is so exorbitant that it simply cannot be obtained.</p><p><a name="060517102000016">For those reasons, and in view of the expressions of support in the House, I shall press the new clause to a Division.</p><p><a name="060517102000017"><i> Question put</i>, That the clause be read a Second time:&#151;</p><br><i> The House divided:</i> Ayes 199, Noes 271.<center><a name="060517102000591"><b>Division No. 243]</b></center>[4.24 pm<br><br><br><br>AYES</br><br><br>Afriyie, Adam<br>Ainsworth, Mr. Peter<br>Alexander, Danny<br>Amess, Mr. David<br>Ancram, rh Mr. Michael<br>Baron, Mr. John<br>Beith, rh Mr. Alan<br>Bellingham, Mr. Henry<br>Benyon, Mr. Richard<br>Bercow, John<br>Binley, Mr. Brian<br>Bone, Mr. Peter<br>Boswell, Mr. Tim<br>Brady, Mr. Graham<br>Brake, Tom<br>Brazier, Mr. Julian<br>Brokenshire, James<br>Browne, Mr. Jeremy<br>Burns, Mr. Simon<br>Burrowes, Mr. David  <br>Burt, Alistair<br>Burt, Lorely<br>Butterfill, Sir John<br>Cable, Dr. Vincent<br>Campbell, Mr. Gregory<br>Campbell, rh Sir Menzies<br>Carmichael, Mr. Alistair<br>Carswell, Mr. Douglas<br>Cash, Mr. William<br>Clappison, Mr. James<br>Clark, Greg<br>Clarke, rh Mr. Kenneth<br>Clegg, Mr. Nick<br>Clifton-Brown, Mr. Geoffrey<br>Cormack, Sir Patrick<br>Crabb, Mr. Stephen<br>Curry, rh Mr. David<br>Davies, David T.C. <i> (Monmouth)</i><br>Davies, Philip<br>Djanogly, Mr. Jonathan<br>Dodds, Mr. Nigel<br>Donaldson, Mr. Jeffrey M.<br>Duncan Smith, rh Mr. Iain<br>Dunne, Mr. Philip<br>Durkan, Mark<br>Ellwood, Mr. Tobias<br>Evans, Mr. Nigel<br>Evennett, Mr. David<br>Fabricant, Michael<br>Fallon, Mr. Michael<br>Farron, Tim<br>Featherstone, Lynne<br>Field, Mr. Mark<br>Foster, Mr. Don<br>Fox, Dr. Liam<br>Francois, Mr. Mark<br>Garnier, Mr. Edward<br>Gauke, Mr. David<br>George, Andrew<br>Gibb, Mr. Nick<br>Gidley, Sandra<br>Gillan, Mrs. Cheryl<br>Goodman, Mr. Paul<br>Goodwill, Mr. Robert<br>Gove, Michael<br>Gray, Mr. James<br>Grayling, Chris<br>Green, Damian<br>Greening, Justine<br>Grieve, Mr. Dominic<br>Hammond, Mr. Philip<br>Hammond, Stephen<br>Hands, Mr. Greg<br>Harper, Mr. Mark<br>Harris, Dr. Evan<br>Harvey, Nick<br>Hayes, Mr. John<br>Heath, Mr. David<br>Heathcoat-Amory, rh Mr. David<br>Hemming, John<br>Herbert, Nick<br>Hoban, Mr. Mark<br>Hollobone, Mr. Philip<br>Holmes, Paul<br>Horam, Mr. John<br>Horwood, Martin<br>Howarth, David<br>Howarth, Mr. Gerald<br>Huhne, Chris<br>Hunt, Mr. Jeremy<br>Hunter, Mark<br>Jack, rh Mr. Michael<br>Jackson, Mr. Stewart<br>Jenkin, Mr. Bernard<br>Johnson, Mr. Boris  <page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/debtext/60517-0164.htm"/>

The Government do not intend to use the Bill to introduce anonymous registration in Northern Ireland, but instead will do so means of an Order in Council. As a result, people there will not be able to take advantage of anonymous registration until much later than their counterparts in Great Britain.

When do they intend to bring the Order in Council before the House? Will it be in place before the annual canvass planned for next year? That is important because, if it is not in place then, people who might want to register anonymously will be forced to make a choice. If they decide not to register, they will give up their right to vote, but if they remain fully on the register, they could put themselves or their families at risk.

We expressed concerns about the abolition of the annual canvass in previous debates; today, we are discussing the same thing in a different way. We were concerned about the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to override the chief electoral officer and, indeed, the legislation. We are now looking at the matter slightly differently. Our amendments would ensure that a canvass took place in 2015 and every 10 years thereafter, so that even if one canvass was delayed, others would be carried out in those years.</p><p><a name="060517102000514">We were a little concerned about the abolition of the annual canvass, but having discussed it with the former CEO, we understood some of the reasons. He felt that it would be better if he could deploy his resources on encouraging people to register rather than carrying out an annual canvass. I can appreciate both sides of the argument, but I am concerned that the Secretary of State could say that a canvass should never be carried out.

Member for Argyll and Bute have a common interest. It is our intention broadly to mirror the provisions on anonymous registration, for the reasons that we discussed in the Committee of the whole House some weeks ago. Anonymous registration is vital to protect individuals who feel threatened and we agree with it. The question is how to do it.</p><p><a name="060517102000518">The new clause would replicate the provisions of the Electoral Administration Bill, and the reason I cannot accept the new clause is not that we are not on the same wavelength in respect of anonymous registration but because there are differences in the operation of electoral law in Northern Ireland. There are registration conditions and anti-fraud measures that do not apply to the rest of the United Kingdom, including, for example, proof of identity requirements at the polling station that are not necessary in Great Britain and which make anonymity more difficult to maintain. There is a range of reasons.</p><p><a name="060517102000519">We shall introduce an Order in Council to give effect to the same principle that the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve, but in a Northern Ireland context. The proposals will be introduced later so that we can consider their implications for Northern Ireland, but the principle is exactly the same. I want anonymous registration in due course and we shall introduce the order after the consultation process. We hope that that will not be long after the scheme is introduced in Great Britain and that any difference in time scale will be a matter of only a few months. I hope that it will be only a few weeks, and that we can introduce the order quickly.</p><p><a name="060517102000520">I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman does not support the whole idea of Orders in Council. I realise that they are not amendable and that that gives rise to difficulties, but on this occasion there are real reasons, which I have outlined, for an Order in Council. I do not expect that he will disagree with the content of the order because it will achieve his objectives, but in a Northern Ireland context.</p><p><a name="060517102000521">I turn to the points made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson). If he looks at clause 3, as I know that he has done, he will see that the Government&#146;s clear intention is that there will be a canvass in 2010. The key point of his amendments is that, if the chief electoral officer believes that the canvass in 2010 is not necessary for him to meet the registration objectives that we have also set out in the legislation&#151;for example, if he feels that a canvass would not improve the comprehensiveness or accuracy&#151;and he believes that, for his own purposes, that the cost of that canvass is not justified, he can recommend to the Secretary of State that the 2010 canvass be cancelled.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1066</b><br><p><a name="060517102000522">Only if such a recommendation is made can the Secretary of State make an order to remove the requirement for a canvass to held in 2010. The Secretary of State cannot unilaterally cancel the canvass in 2010; he can only do so if the chief electoral officer makes a recommendation to that effect because the chief electoral officer, not the Secretary of State, believes that the canvass should be cancelled. Even if that were the case and the Secretary of State accepted the chief electoral officer&#146;s recommendation, it would be subject to approval by both the House and another place.</p><p><a name="060517102000523">Canvasses are very resource-intensive in terms of both labour and money. It is only right that the chief electoral officer has the power to determine how his resources will be best deployed in determining whether or not a canvass is necessary in 2010. Indeed, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury will know that 2010 is only four years after the final annual canvass, which will take place very shortly. I hope that, with the assurance that the Secretary of State has a power only to accept a recommendation, the hon. Gentleman will not press any of his amendments and that the hon.

The new clause would amend the current wording of article 31 of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. If no next of kin or other family member has visited a child in care within 12 months, the relevant authority should certainly appoint an independent visitor to see to the needs and request of the young person who is in care.</p><p><a name="060517102000530">I understand that the system of independent visitors has worked extremely well in Wales, but the practice has been very patchy in Northern Ireland, where some trusts appoint independent visitors, while others choose not to do so or leave doing so until the eleventh hour. The new clause would ensure that, if there had not been a visit to a child in care in a much shorter period of time&#151;three months&#151;an independent visitor would, of necessity, be appointed.</p><p><a name="060517102000531">The matter came to my attention in my constituency for a very particular reason. The whole of Northern Ireland is serviced by one juvenile justice centre, which was opened recently. I pay tribute to&#151;sadly&#151;the late Martin Mogg, who led the way in many ways. He was very progressive in his thinking about modernising juvenile justice in Northern Ireland and I had the great good fortune of being first shown around the juvenile justice centre on the Rathgael road in Bangor by him. I knew at the time that he was ill, but I did not realise just how ill. I am sure that other hon. Members who knew him will wish to join me in paying tribute to his efforts to modernise juvenile justice in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517102000532">I first visited the juvenile justice centre on Good Friday 2004. We are talking about young people who, allegedly, have committed serious offences in Northern Ireland, but who are juveniles. During the course of conversations with some of those young people&#151;particularly the young women, who were being taught for the first time to iron clothes and the young men who were being taught how to make scrambled egg, if I remember correctly, and were delighted to have been given skills to cook, wash, iron and look after themselves&#151;many of them expressed reservations about returning to their communities.</p><p><a name="060517102000533">Those young people&#151;particularly the young women&#151;also gave me a clear impression of how they felt let down by the care system in Northern Ireland. That has remained with me in my conscience for two years. As I say, we have a vehicle to change things and to try to improve the care system in Northern Ireland for young people. It seems a terribly sad fact of life that young people who have gone into care&#151;particularly young women&#151;have ended up in the juvenile justice centre. We have let them down badly somewhere along the line.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1068</b><br><p><a name="060517102000534">I have not drafted the new clause with particular care, but I want to put it on the record that we definitely need a care system that is much more flexible in terms of independent visitors or advocates for young people who go into care for whatever reason&#151;and there are always a variety of reasons. I do not wish those young people to end up in the juvenile justice centre. If the Minister cannot accept the wording of the new clause, I hope that he will give a clear commitment that the issue will be looked at seriously and promptly by the Northern Ireland Office and those who are responsible for juvenile justice in Northern Ireland..</p><p><a name="060517102000535"><b><a name="060517102001080">Dr. Alasdair McDonnell:</b> I welcome the opportunity to raise my concern about child welfare. There are many serious issues. Although I welcome the purpose and intent of my hon. Friend the Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) in proposing the new clause, I have some concerns. I would have preferred the new clause to have been additional to the current legislation, rather than something to be used instead of it. As I understand it&#151;I am subject to correction if I am wrong&#151;article 31(1) of the children order allows independent visitors to be appointed only for children who are in care. Children in care are defined by articles 25(1) and 27(2) as children under care orders. That means that independent visitors cannot be appointed for other children who are very much in need, but who are not fully in care or fully under care orders. Such children may nevertheless need and seek considerable assistance with finding a place to live. They are generally teenage children who are in transition to independent living, but not always. They are known as article 21 children. There is a serious defect because these children are very much in need of support. They are in a halfway house, or no-man&#146;s land, between care and independent living. The new clause would certainly go a long way towards addressing the problem.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517102000588">5 pm</h5><p><a name="060517102000536">The new clause would delete article 31(1) and substitute the new wording, but that would create a new problem, because article 31(1) is essential for the protection of children in care. In fact, we need both provisions. We need visitors to be appointed to children in care, but I would claim that we also need visitors appointed to the many children who are not quite in care or under care orders, but at the boundaries. Such children need support as they move from being in care to independent living.</p><p><a name="060517102000537"><b><a name="060517102001081">Mrs. Iris Robinson (Strangford) (DUP):</b> Does the hon.

I have been involved in youth work for more than 20 years, and I recognise some of what the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) referred to. I remember visiting an organisation in the city of Belfast which dealt with young people from 11 up to 16. I visited one small apartment of a young lady of 15 years of age. She had a young baby in the corner in one of the prams. I was informed that that was her second child.

Friend the Member for Strangford(Mrs. Robinson) mentioned follow-up visits, which are important. Through that organisation, the young people were learning how to take care of basic domestic tasks, from ironing clothes through to handling money, including learning about computers so that they could keep basic accounts. Those were tremendous achievements, but the young people needed to be visited. Many of them had gone through traumatic times, not only because they were used on the streets, but because they were abused in homes by family members. We need to push for such support.

How, then, can he say that there is a difference between the activity of Sinn Fein and the activity of the UVF, and that because the official Unionist party has gone into a coalition with the UVF spokesman, it is in a weaker position?

Members not to press their amendments.</p><p><a name="06051798000044"><i> Question put and agreed to.</i></p><p><a name="06051798000045"><i> Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.</i></p><p><a name="06051798000002">New Clause 2</p><a name="06051798000001"><br><center>Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) order 1977 Amendment</center><br><p class="tabletext">&#145;After subsection 4(a) of the Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 there is inserted&#151;</p><p class="tabletext">&#147;Any building to which Artic1e 12 of the Rates (Capital Values, etc.) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 applies.&#148;.'. &#151;<i> [Mr. Dodds.]</i></p><p><a name="06051798000046"><i> Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p><p><a name="06051798000047"><b><a name="06051798000116">Mr. Dodds:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p><p><a name="06051798000048">The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that buildings to which artic1e 12 of the Rates (Capital Values, etc.) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 applies come under subsection 4, as opposed to subsection 5, of the Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977. Community halls, Orange halls, halls used by the Ancient Order of Hibernians and other types of hall recently gained exemption from rates in Northern Ireland. That move was widely welcomed throughout the community as beneficial for local communities. It relieved a major financial burden for those who run such halls on both sides of the community: on the Unionist side and on the nationalist side. Under the new clause, those halls would also be subject to subsection 4 of the criminal damage compensation provisions, rather than subsection 5. That would bring them into line with agricultural premises.</p><p><a name="06051798000049">Other properties have to prove, for the purposes of getting compensation from the Northern Ireland Office, that three or more people were involved in an attack or commission of an offence that resulted in damage to premises, or the Chief Constable has to issue a certificate indicating that it was carried out by a proscribed organisation. Agricultural premises, on the other hand, are not subject to such stringent provisions. In that case, if the act is deemed to have been carried out maliciously or wantonly, that alone is the condition that applies and compensation is payable. </p><p><a name="06051798000050">Through their recent derating provisions, the Government have recognised the valuable role played by the halls that we are talking about&#151;community halls, Orange halls, halls used by those in the nationalist community. They provide an invaluable community resource. That applies to urban areas, but it is particularly applicable to rural areas. Lest we run away with the idea that the proposal would only benefit  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1052</b><br>people who run those halls, many of them, like parish halls throughout the United Kingdom, are used for a wide range of purposes. In Northern Ireland, they are used by credit unions, community groups and youth services for a vast array of community activities, and their use has expanded a great deal in recent years. The removal of a large financial burden following the introduction of derating was welcomed in Northern Ireland, and I congratulate the Government on taking on board the proposal, which we pressed strongly in our discussions and negotiations with them.</p><p><a name="06051798000051">Insurance is even more financially crippling for those halls than the rates levied on them. Orange halls often make their own provision, which is very costly, because many insurance companies refuse to offer cover for community halls, particularly Orange halls. The cover that is available is extremely expensive, because of the number and extent of sectarian attacks suffered by the halls and the problems that they face in obtaining compensation for such attacks. Sometimes, people seeking insurance for an Orange hall approached more than 30 different companies before finding one that provides cover, and even then at an exorbitant price. They sometimes have to pay four-figure sums for insurance that would cost &#163;100 or &#163;150 in Scotland and England, which is a massive difference. There have been dozens of sectarian attacks in recent years, particularly on Orange halls, which have suffered extensive damage and, in many cases, been razed to the ground. Those attacks are usually carried out in the dead of night, with few witnesses, and they deprive a local community of an invaluable resource.</p><p><a name="06051798000052"><b><a name="06051798000117">Lady Hermon:</b> I support very strongly the new clause tabled by the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues. He will have noticed that the Minister expressed support for the Government document, &#147;A Shared Future&#148;. Would it not be helpful if the Government did not just talk the talk but walked the walk and supported the proposal, which usefully acknowledges the traditions and cultures not just of the Orange Order but of the Ancient Order of Hibernian?</p><p><a name="06051798000053"><b><a name="06051798000118">Mr. Dodds:</b> I very much welcome the hon. Lady&#146;s support. She is quite right. The case for the halls has been made, and the argument has been won, as evidenced by the fact that the Government decided exceptionally to introduce derating for the halls only a few months ago. The principle and precedent have been established: the new clause would simply remove a major financial burden that has an even greater impact than rates, so I hope that the Minister has it in his gift to respond positively to the proposal.</p><p><a name="06051798000054"><b><a name="06051798000119">Mr. Peter Robinson:</b> My hon. Friend is making a powerful case&#151;one so compelling that no reasonable Minister could resist it. The fact that compensation is not paid after halls are destroyed makes them all the more a target. In the sectarian attacks that have taken place, there is the knowledge that the responsibility and the cost will be borne directly by the Orangemen or the Ancient Order of Hibernians concerned. That makes it much more attractive because the perpetrators know the pain that will result from the attack.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1053</b><br><h5 align="left"><a name="06051798000086">4 pm</h5><p><a name="06051798000055"><b><a name="06051798000120">Mr. Dodds:</b> My hon. Friend has highlighted a significant aspect. Those who carry out the attacks see that they are hurting the Orange community directly. Those who attack other halls on the nationalist side are doing the same on that side. They are impacting directly on the community. That, as my hon. Friend points out, provides an incentive for further attacks. There is no greater incentive for the arsonists, vandals and hooligans who carry out the attacks than to see halls that they have attacked previously lying derelict and, in some cases, razed to the ground for months and in many cases years on end, as people struggle to get compensation from their insurers, if they have insurers, or from the Northern Ireland Office, which refuses to provide insurance. They have to resort to raising the funds themselves, which in many cases is virtually impossible.</p><p><a name="06051798000056">The way that the system operates is an incentive for arsonists to go on attacking isolated halls. I should draw the attention of the House to the areas affected. I have a list of the arson attacks on Orange halls. I do not have a complete list of all the halls that have been attacked throughout Northern Ireland, but last year there were attacks on three Orange halls in County Tyrone, two in County Down, another one in County Tyrone, one in County Antrim, one in Armagh, two in Belfast and another one in Armagh. The attacks are widespread throughout the Province and are having a major impact on local communities.</p><p><a name="06051798000057"><b><a name="06051798000121">Dr. McCrea:</b> The list that my hon. Friend read out reflects the fact that the halls often represent a small, and in the local area a minority, community. Local people therefore are not able to pay for the rebuilding of the hall. My hon. Friend mentioned halls that were attacked in Tyrone. Those were isolated Protestant communities in a large nationalist or republican area. The attack on the hall was an attack on the culture of a small minority community.</p><p><a name="06051798000058"><b><a name="06051798000122">Mr. Dodds:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Halls that have been targeted&#151;for example, in Castlederg, Strabane, Altnaveigh in Newry, and Whiterock in Belfast, near my constituency&#151;are all situated in areas where the Protestant Unionist community is very much in the minority. That is a feature of the preponderance of attacks that have taken place, though it is not exclusively the case. They are seen as attacks on vulnerable communities, depriving them of what is for many of them their only local community resource.</p><p><a name="06051798000059">I know that the Minister takes such matters very seriously. In recent months he has spent a long time looking into issues in deprived Unionist areas in particular, and deprived areas generally. He has spoken to many people in local communities in Belfast and in rural areas. I know that he has heard directly from many organisations, community groups and individuals who make extensive use of Orange halls and other halls, and who have told him how important it is that those facilities continue to be made available for local communities in their areas.</p><p><a name="06051798000060">The new clause is in line with the Government&#146;s recent derating of Orange halls, and it is all of a piece with the proposals announced by the Minister recently, when he  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1054</b><br>said that he was in the business of trying to bring about regeneration and give confidence to deprived Unionist and loyalist areas. If the Government were to adopt the amendment, it would be seen as a positive step in not only Unionist communities, but nationalist communities.</p><p><a name="06051798000061">The amendment would not cost the Government a considerable amount of money. They may say that we must not open the floodgates to large amounts of Government expenditure, but the fact that they have been prepared to move on the issue of the rates indicates that they recognise the issue.</p><p><a name="06051798000062">The Minister followed through on his consultation process in those communities with a &#163;33 million package, and something similar could be done to help communities in not only Belfast, but throughout Northern Ireland. The DUP welcomed that package, but we recognise that a lot of it was centred on deprived areas, particularly in Greater Belfast. We accept that the bulk of the most deprived areas are in Belfast, but we have also made the point that the process should not stop there and that more needs to be done for rural areas and the west of the Province. This is a tremendous opportunity for the Government to take that process forward and implement in a practical yet modest way a measure that would give a tremendous fillip to communities throughout Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="06051798000063">I urge the Minister to accept the amendment. It is clear that the current regulations, which require proof that a hall has been attacked unlawfully, maliciously and wantonly by three or more persons unlawfully, riotously or tumultuously assembled, or as a result of an act committed maliciously by a person actingon behalf of or in connection with an unlawful association, are often unworkable, because in a huge number of cases it is impossible to prove that those conditions were met. Such attacks often take place in the dead of night in isolated areas. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the motivation behind attacks on community halls is sectarian, yet obtaining compensation for such an attack can, even when it is done successfully, be tortuous and involve extremely costly insurance premiums.</p><p><a name="06051798000064">Such premises should be categorised in the same way as agricultural premises, which have been categorised in Northern Ireland for the precise reasons that I have enunciated. Agricultural premises were targeted in the dead of night and, although everybody knew why it was happening, the matter could not be proved. Historically, the Government have recognised that certain types of buildings and premises deserve special categorisation, because they are in isolated areas and are difficult to protect and defend, and Unionist and nationalist halls across the community deserve to be placed in that category. I trust that the Minister will respond positively to the amendment.</p><p><a name="06051798000065"><b><a name="06051798000123">Lembit &#214;pik:</b> I want to add two thoughts to the remarks by the hon. Member for Belfast, North(Mr. Dodds). First, it seems that there is some justification for saying that in certain circumstances in which natural justice would point towards a compensation payout, such payouts have been prevented by the strictures outlined by the hon. Member for Belfast, North, because the conditions are difficult to prove. He cites the example of a rural and  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1055</b><br>isolated premises that might be subject to an arson attack. The same thing can happen in urban areas. Will the Minister outline his understanding of the extent to which this is a problem?</p><p><a name="06051798000066">My second concern is that it looks as though an accident of circumstance can mean that an attack in two different situations will lead to very different outcomes as regards compensation, through no fault of the person making the compensation claim. What is the Minister&#146;s view of that apparent double standard? I know that he would agree that it is an unintended consequence of the Bill, but it strikes me that the new clause could resolve the disparity. It would be terribly undesirable were compensation not to be paid out in some situations. I hope that he can either accept the new clause or provide clarity about what the Government regard as the best course of action to ensure that those in rural and isolated areas, or those who cannot prove the nature of an attack, are not treated as second-class citizens.</p><p><a name="06051798000067"><b><a name="06051798000124">Mr. Hanson:</b> I thank the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds) for tabling his new clause.</p><p><a name="06051798000068">I start by utterly condemning any attacks or vandalism on Orange or Hibernian halls, or any other buildings used for meetings. Whether they are attacked as a matter of general vandalism or subject to an attack of a sectarian nature, that is unacceptable in a civilised society. I would urge, as would the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), that any individuals who had information about such attacks should take it to the police, who may be able to undertake prosecution. Those who carry out such attacks should face the full force of the law&#151;that is self-evident in a civilised society.</p><p><a name="06051798000069">Let me say to the hon. Member for Belfast, North in particular that the current criminal damage legislation is an important means of supporting individuals and groups who have suffered material loss over the period of conflict in Northern Ireland. Now that we are moving, I hope, to a more normal society, such attacks, particularly the sectarian ones, should be reduced. That will in due course have obvious implications for current criminal damage arrangements generally.</p><p><a name="06051798000070">The Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 is particular to Northern Ireland. As we all know, that is because of the particular problems faced by Northern Ireland at that time. Such legislation does not exist in other parts of the United Kingdom. I want to reflect on the future of such compensation schemes, particularly in the context of a changing Northern Ireland and the Government&#146;s national approach to compensation. Of course, I recognise the great hurt and pain that can be caused, be it by a small act of vandalism causing a broken window or something much more serious in the shape of an arson attack on an entire building. The Police Service of Northern Ireland takes such criminal acts very seriously and will use the full weight of the law to prosecute the perpetrators.</p><p><a name="06051798000071">Before turning to the new clause, I will respond to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik), who asked me about the nature and number of such attacks. I recently answered a parliamentary question&#151;if it was  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1056</b><br>not me, it was my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for security&#151;which indicated that police figures show that over the past 15 years, attacks on Orange halls in particular have varied significantly. In 1997, therewere 41 attacks; in 2004, there were six attacks; and the provisional figure for 2005 was higher than that for 2004. That information gives no specifics on the nature of the attack&#151;it could be a broken window or a full arson attack on a building.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="06051798000087">4.15 pm</h5><p><a name="06051798000072">The new clause seeks to change article 4 of the Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which was drafted to meet specific conditions relating to agricultural property, particularly the absence of a Chief Constable&#146;s certificate where the damage was caused by those acting on behalf of an illegal organisation, or the evidence of the involvement of three or more persons.</p><p><a name="06051798000073">Claims for non-agricultural properties are covered under article 5 of the Criminal Damage (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 and, where its conditions are satisfied, claimants can obtain compensation for damage to such property. A Chief Constable&#146;s certificate, or proof of the involvement of three or more persons or of an illegal organisation, are generally required as proof of liability in respect of claims for compensation. Where there is evidence of damage caused by civil disorder, for example, Orange halls can make claims under the provisions of the order. When claims are not met under compensation arrangements, they should fall under commercial insurance arrangements in the normal way. We are dealing here with the question of whether we should give compensation to Orange halls on a par with that given to agricultural buildings when there is no Chief Constable&#146;s certificate and no evidence of the involvement of three or more persons.</p><p><a name="06051798000074">The effect of the new clause would be to extend the category of properties falling under article 4, which was not intended for that purpose. The Government believe that, when a property is damaged and when there is no Chief Constable&#146;s certificate and no evidence of the involvement of three or more persons&#151;when the circumstances do not meet the evidential requirement of the legislation covering criminal damage compensation&#151;the normal route for seeking compensation, in Northern Ireland as in other parts of the United Kingdom, is through general property insurance.</p><p><a name="06051798000075">I recognise that there can be difficulties in obtaining insurance, and I have discussed this issue with the hon. Member for Belfast, North. The Orange Order is a powerful organisation in the fabric of Northern Ireland, however, and it represents an awful lot of individuals and organisations. I would hope that it could use its power to raise these issues with the insurance companies.</p><p><a name="06051798000076">I know that it will disappoint the hon. Gentleman that I am unable to accept his new clause today. The provisions relating to the specific circumstances of agricultural properties were made in 1977. There is an anomaly involved, as that is the only area that is covered. However, there is compensation available for circumstances involving collective discontent and disorder, and compensation can also be obtained with a Chief Constable&#146;s certificate or with evidence of the involvement of three or more people. I am unable to accept the new clause for those reasons.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1057</b><br><p><a name="06051798000077"><b><a name="06051798000125">Lady Hermon:</b> If the Minister is not prepared to accept the new clause, will he consider an alternative that would make things easier for organisations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians and, particularly, the Orange Order, which bears the brunt of these problems? Could not the Northern Ireland Office pay for CCTV cameras to be installed at the premises of such organisations, in order that they might gather the evidence themselves under the present scheme? Will the Minister agree to that?</p><p><a name="06051798000078"><b><a name="06051798000126">Mr. Hanson:</b> The hon. Lady will know that I have recently announced additional resources for CCTV cameras, and a competition for individual organisations to bid for such cameras. That is possible for any organisation to do, subject to their demonstrating that the cameras would be of benefit in the prevention of crime. In principle, there is nothing to preclude an organisation from bidding for CCTV cameras to cover Orange halls. I cannot, and nor would I wish to, fund CCTV cameras at every Orange hall site, because that would be an impractical way of implementing Government policy. However, in principle, there is nothing wrong with applications being made to that effect.</p><p><a name="06051798000079">The hon. Member for Belfast, North mentioned the significant investment of &#163;33 million in areas of deprivation, and we have also undertaken the derating of Orange halls, which has released significant resources to the organisation. I know that he and his party welcomed that move, having pressed for it. The Government supported that change, and considered it a positive move forward in releasing those resources to the Orange halls. I know that he will be disappointed that I cannot accept his new clause today, but I cannot. I have explained the reasons for my decision, and I hope that he will withdraw it on that basis.</p><p><a name="060517102000009"><b><a name="060517102000592">Mr. Dodds:</b> I have listened to the Minister&#146;s comments and I am disappointed that he does not feel able to accept the new clause or to take on board the suggestion made by the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) that he might at least provide such halls with the opportunity to try to claim compensation&#151;as many of them do not have insurance&#151;by gathering evidence from CCTV.</p><p><a name="060517102000010"><b><a name="060517102000593">Mr. Hanson:</b> I emphasise again that if the Chief Constable offers certification to the effect that the damage was caused by disorder or other associated means, and if three or more people were involved, criminal compensation can be claimed. The problem only exists if fewer people were involved.</p><p><a name="060517102000011"><b><a name="060517102000594">Mr. Dodds:</b> I understand that that is the legal position, which is precisely the problem. That is why we have tabled the new clause. While we understand that three or more people must be involved in an attack for compensation to be payable, the difficulty is proving that three or more people were involved. We are talking about buildings that have clearly been destroyed for sectarian reasons and as part of a wider campaign, as has been happening for decades in Northern Ireland. It was for precisely that reason that the Government introduced an exception for agricultural premises in  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1058</b><br>section 4 of the 1997 order, to which the Minister referred. That accepted that, for certain types of premises, it would be difficult to provide proof.</p><p><a name="060517102000012">My party&#146;s suggestion is that the same criteria should apply in relation to halls&#151;primarily Orange halls, but also to nationalist halls such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians and others&#151;so that they are not crippled in that way and that local communities are not deprived of an extremely valuable resource, in many cases for years and sometimes for ever. All hon. Members recognise the valuable and important role that such parish halls play in our communities up and down the land, day in and day out.</p><p><a name="060517102000013"><b><a name="060517102000595">Lembit &#214;pik:</b> In that context, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Minister&#146;s position seems to step against normalisation, as he has created a double standard in relation to the burden of proof in some circumstances? I cannot see why the Minister is making such heavy weather of accepting a fairly common-sense proposal that provides proper and sensible protection in a way that cannot realistically be abused.</p><p><a name="060517102000014"><b><a name="060517102000596">Mr. Dodds:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I hope that his additional words, even at this late stage, will cause the Minister to think again. This short debate has illustrated a fairly strong consensus on the issue. Most people see the proposal as fairly modest.It is in line with Government policy, the recent announcement of a package of measures and the recent announcement on derating. It accepts that there are anomalies for certain types of premises. The proposal simply ensures that local communities will not be deprived.</p><p><a name="060517102000015">Finally, the Minister asked whether the owners of such halls, and the Orange Order in particular, could go to the insurers and talk to them. No doubt the Minister will be aware&#151;some of his colleagues should be, as the Orange Order has made this clear to Ministers in talks&#151;that this matter has been the subject of years of discussion and negotiation with insurers.

name="060517102001073">Mr. Reid:</b> New clause 4 replicates the provisions of section 10 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006, which introduces anonymous registration provisions in Great Britain but does not extend to Northern Ireland. However, the principal justifications for anonymous registration in Great Britain apply equally well in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517102000505">In Great Britain, people who fear that their security, or that of their families, will be put at risk if their names appear on the register are allowed to apply to register anonymously. Given that the principles behind anonymous registration were debated at length in Committee, where there was widespread support for introducing it in Northern Ireland, I shall not repeat all the arguments today.</p><p><a name="060517102000506">We have tabled the new clause to elicit from the Minister an explanation of why the Government treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The Government do not intend to use the Bill to introduce anonymous registration in Northern Ireland, but instead will do so means of an Order in Council. As a result, people there will not be able to take advantage of anonymous registration until much later than their counterparts in Great Britain. I hope that the Minister will answer a few questions about that.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1064</b><br><p><a name="060517102000507">Will there be a consultation in Northern Ireland before the Government introduce the secondary legislation here? Secondary legislation cannot be debated and amended by this House, so consultation is even more important than with primary legislation.</p><p><a name="060517102000508">Do the Government have a proposed timetable for implementation of the provision? When do they intend to bring the Order in Council before the House? Will it be in place before the annual canvass planned for next year? That is important because, if it is not in place then, people who might want to register anonymously will be forced to make a choice. If they decide not to register, they will give up their right to vote, but if they remain fully on the register, they could put themselves or their families at risk. The next canvass is not due until 2010, but it could be as late as 2016 if the Secretary of State uses his power of veto.</p><p><a name="060517102000509"><b><a name="060517102001074">Lembit &#214;pik:</b> The Minister is likely to stand up and give the reasons why the Government are not willing to accept this commonsense proposal, and we have just had a vote on a matter in which he showed no interest at all. He did not take the DUP&#146;s amendment at all seriously, but does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister would do a lot better if he showed some sympathy and empathy for what is being proposed?</p><p><a name="060517102000510"><b><a name="060517102001075">Mr. Reid:</b> I agree wholeheartedly. The Minister showed little sympathy for the earlier amendment. I hope that he will do better this time and at least answer my questions properly. People&#146;s right to vote is a key element of a democratic society, but they are also entitled to exercise that right in complete security and in a way that does not put at risk their lives, or the lives of their families.</p><p><a name="060517102000511">The right to anonymous registration has been introduced in the rest of the UK. I do not see why it should not be introduced in Northern Ireland, especially given the all-party support that the proposal received in Committee.

We expressed concerns about the abolition of the annual canvass in previous debates; today, we are discussing the same thing in a different way. We were concerned about the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to override the chief electoral officer and, indeed, the legislation. We are now looking at the matter slightly differently. Our amendments would ensure that a canvass took place in 2015 and every 10 years thereafter, so that even if one canvass was delayed, others would be carried out in those years.</p><p><a name="060517102000514">We were a little concerned about the abolition of the annual canvass, but having discussed it with the former CEO, we understood some of the reasons. He felt that it would be better if he could deploy his resources on encouraging people to register rather than carrying out an annual canvass. I can appreciate both sides of the argument, but I am concerned that the Secretary of State could say that a canvass should never be carried out. It is important to hold a canvass every so often, as people move or slip through the net.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1065</b><br><p><a name="060517102000515">I commend our amendments; they are innocuous and I am sure that the Government will see them in that way. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p><p><a name="060517102000516"><b><a name="060517102001077">Mr. Hanson:</b> I appreciate the way in which the hon. Members for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) and for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) made their proposals.</p><p><a name="060517102000517">The Government and the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute have a common interest. It is our intention broadly to mirror the provisions on anonymous registration, for the reasons that we discussed in the Committee of the whole House some weeks ago. Anonymous registration is vital to protect individuals who feel threatened and we agree with it. The question is how to do it.</p><p><a name="060517102000518">The new clause would replicate the provisions of the Electoral Administration Bill, and the reason I cannot accept the new clause is not that we are not on the same wavelength in respect of anonymous registration but because there are differences in the operation of electoral law in Northern Ireland. There are registration conditions and anti-fraud measures that do not apply to the rest of the United Kingdom, including, for example, proof of identity requirements at the polling station that are not necessary in Great Britain and which make anonymity more difficult to maintain. There is a range of reasons.</p><p><a name="060517102000519">We shall introduce an Order in Council to give effect to the same principle that the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve, but in a Northern Ireland context. The proposals will be introduced later so that we can consider their implications for Northern Ireland, but the principle is exactly the same. I want anonymous registration in due course and we shall introduce the order after the consultation process. We hope that that will not be long after the scheme is introduced in Great Britain and that any difference in time scale will be a matter of only a few months. I hope that it will be only a few weeks, and that we can introduce the order quickly.</p><p><a name="060517102000520">I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman does not support the whole idea of Orders in Council. I realise that they are not amendable and that that gives rise to difficulties, but on this occasion there are real reasons, which I have outlined, for an Order in Council. I do not expect that he will disagree with the content of the order because it will achieve his objectives, but in a Northern Ireland context.</p><p><a name="060517102000521">I turn to the points made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson). If he looks at clause 3, as I know that he has done, he will see that the Government&#146;s clear intention is that there will be a canvass in 2010. The key point of his amendments is that, if the chief electoral officer believes that the canvass in 2010 is not necessary for him to meet the registration objectives that we have also set out in the legislation&#151;for example, if he feels that a canvass would not improve the comprehensiveness or accuracy&#151;and he believes that, for his own purposes, that the cost of that canvass is not justified, he can recommend to the Secretary of State that the 2010 canvass be cancelled.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1066</b><br><p><a name="060517102000522">Only if such a recommendation is made can the Secretary of State make an order to remove the requirement for a canvass to held in 2010. The Secretary of State cannot unilaterally cancel the canvass in 2010; he can only do so if the chief electoral officer makes a recommendation to that effect because the chief electoral officer, not the Secretary of State, believes that the canvass should be cancelled. Even if that were the case and the Secretary of State accepted the chief electoral officer&#146;s recommendation, it would be subject to approval by both the House and another place.</p><p><a name="060517102000523">Canvasses are very resource-intensive in terms of both labour and money. It is only right that the chief electoral officer has the power to determine how his resources will be best deployed in determining whether or not a canvass is necessary in 2010. Indeed, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury will know that 2010 is only four years after the final annual canvass, which will take place very shortly. I hope that, with the assurance that the Secretary of State has a power only to accept a recommendation, the hon. Gentleman will not press any of his amendments and that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute will withdraw the motion.</p><p><a name="060517102000524"><b><a name="060517102001078">Mr. Reid:</b> I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government are committed to the principle of introducing anonymous registration to Northern Ireland, that there would be a consultation process and that the legislation would come into effect either onlya few weeks or, at most, a few months after the legislation for the rest of the United Kingdom.

I hope that he enjoys it, is extremely successful and delivers all that I request, including accepting the new clause.</p><p><a name="060517102000529">Since this is the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I have an opportunity to introduce, under the heading of miscellaneous, a very important issue that has come to my attention for a certain reason in North Down. The new clause would amend the current wording of article 31 of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. If no next of kin or other family member has visited a child in care within 12 months, the relevant authority should certainly appoint an independent visitor to see to the needs and request of the young person who is in care.</p><p><a name="060517102000530">I understand that the system of independent visitors has worked extremely well in Wales, but the practice has been very patchy in Northern Ireland, where some trusts appoint independent visitors, while others choose not to do so or leave doing so until the eleventh hour. The new clause would ensure that, if there had not been a visit to a child in care in a much shorter period of time&#151;three months&#151;an independent visitor would, of necessity, be appointed.</p><p><a name="060517102000531">The matter came to my attention in my constituency for a very particular reason. The whole of Northern Ireland is serviced by one juvenile justice centre, which was opened recently. I pay tribute to&#151;sadly&#151;the late Martin Mogg, who led the way in many ways. He was very progressive in his thinking about modernising juvenile justice in Northern Ireland and I had the great good fortune of being first shown around the juvenile justice centre on the Rathgael road in Bangor by him. I knew at the time that he was ill, but I did not realise just how ill. I am sure that other hon. Members who knew him will wish to join me in paying tribute to his efforts to modernise juvenile justice in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517102000532">I first visited the juvenile justice centre on Good Friday 2004. We are talking about young people who, allegedly, have committed serious offences in Northern Ireland, but who are juveniles. During the course of conversations with some of those young people&#151;particularly the young women, who were being taught for the first time to iron clothes and the young men who were being taught how to make scrambled egg, if I remember correctly, and were delighted to have been given skills to cook, wash, iron and look after themselves&#151;many of them expressed reservations about returning to their communities.</p><p><a name="060517102000533">Those young people&#151;particularly the young women&#151;also gave me a clear impression of how they felt let down by the care system in Northern Ireland. That has remained with me in my conscience for two years. As I say, we have a vehicle to change things and to try to improve the care system in Northern Ireland for young people. It seems a terribly sad fact of life that young people who have gone into care&#151;particularly young women&#151;have ended up in the juvenile justice centre. We have let them down badly somewhere along the line.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1068</b><br><p><a name="060517102000534">I have not drafted the new clause with particular care, but I want to put it on the record that we definitely need a care system that is much more flexible in terms of independent visitors or advocates for young people who go into care for whatever reason&#151;and there are always a variety of reasons. I do not wish those young people to end up in the juvenile justice centre. If the Minister cannot accept the wording of the new clause, I hope that he will give a clear commitment that the issue will be looked at seriously and promptly by the Northern Ireland Office and those who are responsible for juvenile justice in Northern Ireland..</p><p><a name="060517102000535"><b><a name="060517102001080">Dr. Alasdair McDonnell:</b> I welcome the opportunity to raise my concern about child welfare. There are many serious issues. Although I welcome the purpose and intent of my hon. Friend the Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) in proposing the new clause, I have some concerns. I would have preferred the new clause to have been additional to the current legislation, rather than something to be used instead of it. As I understand it&#151;I am subject to correction if I am wrong&#151;article 31(1) of the children order allows independent visitors to be appointed only for children who are in care. Children in care are defined by articles 25(1) and 27(2) as children under care orders. That means that independent visitors cannot be appointed for other children who are very much in need, but who are not fully in care or fully under care orders. Such children may nevertheless need and seek considerable assistance with finding a place to live. They are generally teenage children who are in transition to independent living, but not always. They are known as article 21 children. There is a serious defect because these children are very much in need of support. They are in a halfway house, or no-man&#146;s land, between care and independent living. The new clause would certainly go a long way towards addressing the problem.</p><h5 align="left"><a name="060517102000588">5 pm</h5><p><a name="060517102000536">The new clause would delete article 31(1) and substitute the new wording, but that would create a new problem, because article 31(1) is essential for the protection of children in care. In fact, we need both provisions. We need visitors to be appointed to children in care, but I would claim that we also need visitors appointed to the many children who are not quite in care or under care orders, but at the boundaries. Such children need support as they move from being in care to independent living.</p><p><a name="060517102000537"><b><a name="060517102001081">Mrs. Iris Robinson (Strangford) (DUP):</b> Does the hon.

The follow-up is poor and, in many cases, weak. We have many problems in Northern Ireland with inadequate child care. The inadequacy is often driven by underfunding, which is being compounded at the moment by cuts at the education board level. I do not like to bring this matter to the feet of our new Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1069</b><br>and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), immediately, because I would like to give him the opportunity to get to grips with the situation, but there is a serious problem. I welcome the new clause, but I would have preferred the new provision to be additional to article 31(1)&#151;perhaps that is not possible at this stage&#151;because we need to hold on to the existing article. I am in a dilemma about that, so I would like to hear his comments. We need to retain the old provision as well as adding the wording in the new clause.</p><p><a name="060517102000539"><b><a name="060517102001083">Sir Patrick Cormack:</b> I support the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon), who moved new clause 6, and the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Dr. McDonnell), both of whom have a much more detailed knowledge of such matters than I. However, I know from representations that I have received and conversations that I have had in Belfast and elsewhere that there is considerable concern about the inadequacy of child care and supervision in the Province. The hon. Member for Strangford(Mrs. Robinson) outlined that in her intervention, too.</p><p><a name="060517102000540">I, too, welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), to his new post. I am sure that his background will give him a real insight into the problems and sympathy with the situation. In his previous incarnation, he had a degree of responsibility for some of the most difficult young people in the United Kingdom, and I met him when he was acting in that capacity on at least one occasion. These young people need not soft treatment, but care and concern. No matter what offences they may have committed, they must have the chance of rehabilitation and hope, and I think that that is what the hon. Member for North Down is trying to achieve.</p><p><a name="060517102000541">The hon. Lady indicated that the drafting of the new clause might not be absolutely acceptable at the moment, but she has put down a marker. I hope that the Minister will reply by indicating his concern and willingness to examine the situation. The care of young people in Northern Ireland is a matter that the Select Committee might want to address in a future inquiry because there is concern about it throughout the  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1070</b><br>Province.

I have been involved in youth work for more than 20 years, and I recognise some of what the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) referred to. I remember visiting an organisation in the city of Belfast which dealt with young people from 11 up to 16. I visited one small apartment of a young lady of 15 years of age. She had a young baby in the corner in one of the prams. I was informed that that was her second child. Some of the young people had been used on the streets of Belfast by paramilitary organisations and some of them had got pregnant.</p><p><a name="060517102000543">My hon. Friend the Member for Strangford(Mrs. Robinson) mentioned follow-up visits, which are important. Through that organisation, the young people were learning how to take care of basic domestic tasks, from ironing clothes through to handling money, including learning about computers so that they could keep basic accounts. Those were tremendous achievements, but the young people needed to be visited. Many of them had gone through traumatic times, not only because they were used on the streets, but because they were abused in homes by family members. We need to push for such support. Will the Minister give the new clause serious consideration and see whether there is something that he can do?</p><h4 align="center"><a name="060517102000002">deferred division</h4><p><a name="060517102000544"><b><a name="060517102001085">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Alan Haselhurst):</b> I am now to announce the result of a Division deferred on the question of a Joint Committee on Conventions.</p>  <page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/debtext/60517-0165.htm"/>

It is not an attempt to create a hurdle. It is a long-standing requirement. It is what was meant by the reference in the pledge of office to being committed to entirely democratic and peaceful means. That must involve upholding and supporting the police, which has not been done. It is therefore important for us to send the right signal.</p><p><a name="060517111000036">I take the point made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). I believe that this argument has been weakened somewhat by the activities of one of the  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1081</b><br>Unionist parties in Northern Ireland. At least in the House of Commons, even today, all who represent the Unionist tradition have made it clear that they envisage no role in Government for those who have been involved in terrorism.</p><p><a name="060517111000037">Only last week, when the Secretary of State appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) put on record what the IMC report had said in paragraphs 2.30 and 2.31 about the activities of the Ulster Volunteer Force. I will not read it out now, because time is short. Two days later, the hon. Lady was completely undermined by her own party, which seemed to have ignored all that the IMC had said because, in terms of ministerial posts, it was in its interests to do so. That was the reason given. At the weekend I conducted an interview with one of the party&#146;s leading negotiators, and that was the only reason he gave. He did not say that it would help the UUP to persuade the UVF to give up its guns and its criminality; he simply said that it would give the party an extra position should an Executive be established.</p><p><a name="060517111000038">I believe that that cynical exercise has, to an extent, undermined the position that the Unionists have adopted. I should make it clear, however, that we believe the same requirement should apply across the board. We cannot allow it to be weakened by the fact that some may have decided for cynical reasons to ally themselves with those whom the IMC has accused of being engaged in all kinds of criminal and terrorist activity.</p><p><a name="060517111000039">This is an important new clause. The Government must stop being ambivalent toward the behaviour of Sinn Fein and its associates, and toward that of others involved in terrorist activity. It does not matter whether or not the Minister includes this test in the Bill: we will apply it to Sinn Fein. It would be much better to include that test in the Bill, however, so that the clear message is sent to terrorists and to Sinn Fein that the whole democratic body of the United Kingdom supports the test and requires that it is met. But we will make the judgment, and as we have made clear today, if Sinn Fein persists in its refusal to back law and order and the police, and persists in its refusal to encourage those who are influenced by it to support the police, it will not be regarded as fit for government and will not be included in the Executive.</p><p><a name="060517111000040">The Minister is keen to have devolution in Northern Ireland by the end of November. The one way to ensure that that does not happen is to allow Sinn Fein to believe that it is not going to be pushed into doing the proper thing, the democratic thing, the right thing, which is to support the police, who will have to enforce the laws that they would wish to pass in an Executive.</p><p><a name="060517111000041"><b><a name="060517111000720">Mr. Hanson:</b> For the avoidance of any doubt, I say straight away to the hon.

This Government, the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) and I all believe that Sinn Fein should be involved in, sign up to and support policing, and that they should take their places on the Policing Board. I am not going  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1082</b><br>to defend in this House a situation in which attacks on schools could occur, or in which individuals are not encouraged to go to the police to ensure that information about rapes is passed on. I make it clear to the hon. Member for East Antrim and others that the Government look forward to the day when Sinn Fein members take their place on the Policing Board and all citizens of Northern Ireland respect and support policing in the community and at large.</p><p><a name="060517111000042">We share the aim of the hon.

My problem with the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury relates to the ability to legislate according to it. First, it is important to put on the record that there is movement in the direction of travel that those who have spoken today want to see. In paragraph 2.19 of its 10th report, the Independent Monitoring Commission&#151;an independent body, not the Government or a political party represented in this House&#151;states:</p><a name="060517111000685"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe that the leadership&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000047">of Sinn Fein and of the IRA</p><a name="060517111000686"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has accepted the need to engage in policing if it is to achieve its aim of devolution of policing and justice to an Assembly and Executive in Northern Ireland.

The hon. Member for East Antrim said that there is a problem of definition with the new clause, and that is the nub of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) intimated as much, because we cannot define what the rule of law means or what support for it means. We know the direction of travel in broad terms, but I cannot define it in legislation.</p><p><a name="060517111000051"><b><a name="060517111000725">Mr. Laurence Robertson:</b> The Minister will be aware that the word most often used in law is &#147;reasonable&#148;.

I draw the attention of hon.

The pledge of office in place at present ensures that all Ministers must affirm, before taking any post, a commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means. The current pledge of office can also be affected by IMC recommendations&#151;and that is an important point. For example, if a future IMC report determined that individuals or organisations were not acting in the spirit of the pledge of office, safeguards are in place so that action could be taken.</p><p><a name="060517111000053"><b><a name="060517111000727">Sir Patrick Cormack:</b> I have a high regard for the Minister, as he knows, but there are times when the Government have to behave with real firmness. We need the smack of firm Government. The Government must tell these people that unless they make such a pledge, there is no place for them in the Government of any part of the UK. If the Government do not do that, they will not achieve devolved Government in Northern Ireland&#151;which we want them to achieve.</p><p><a name="060517111000054"><b><a name="060517111000728">Mr. Hanson:</b> I reciprocate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiments, but he will understand that every hon. Member who has spoken today shares the same objective. I simply do not feel that legislating for it in the way proposed, with due respect to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury would achieve that end or, for the reasons of definition mentioned by the hon. Member for East Antrim, would be applicable.</p><p><a name="060517111000055"><b><a name="060517111000729">Rev. Ian Paisley:</b> The situation arose after those men had taken that pledge: they resorted to violence and some of them made statements justifying it. Why was nothing done then? The Government did not say that those men had to leave the Executive: they closed down the whole lot. I was accused of a sin and so were all the other Members, but those men were not.</p><p><a name="060517111000056"><b><a name="060517111000730">Mr. Hanson:</b> If the right hon. Gentleman is not happy with the current pledge of office and its operation&#151;I take it from his comments that he is not&#151;I have given a commitment previously, and I reaffirm it today, that we are happy to consider further legislation in due course on a stronger pledge of office, if such measures are produced by agreement as part of discussions of strand 1 issues. He will know that I am happy to discuss that and, in fact, I have sat across a table from his colleagues and raised the prospect with them.</p><p><a name="060517111000057">For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that the Government are committed to supporting the rule of law and the involvement of Sinn Fein and other interested parties in policing. That is essential, but the new clause would not assist in that process and I ask the hon.

Members will know, there is a clear path open to us now on Northern Ireland&#146;s political development to ensure that, as has been stated by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, by the end of 2006 we bring about clear political progress for the political organisations in Northern Ireland and for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland. It is now for local politicians to take forward that task of devolution. I am pleased that we are meeting today, in the week that the Assembly reconvened following the passing of earlier legislation; that we have in place Assembly Members who are signed up again to take part in the Assembly; and that we had debates on the Floor of the Assembly this week, with participation from Members from across the Assembly. I believe, as do the Government, that the Assembly offers a better future for Northern Ireland. Now, through the Bill, we are in a position to take forward the possible next stages of devolution in Northern Ireland by devolving criminal justice and policing.</p><p><a name="060517111000555">Given what has been said today, no one fails to accept that there are still major hurdles to overcome and that work must be done, not least to get the proper Executive-led Assembly back in place by November. Additionally, difficulties are self-evident to anyone who has been involved in our debates on the possible devolution of criminal justice and policing. However, the Bill sets a clear path before the House: devolution in October or November&#151;I hope&#151;at the very latest with the Executive back in place. At some point in the future, we will have the framework and opportunity for the devolution of criminal justice and policing. For the sake of having the discussion again, the famous triple&#151;or perhaps now even quadruple&#151;lock is in place whereby the Assembly, the Secretary of State and the Government must agree with the House of Commons if such devolution is to take place. In all essence, however, the framework is in place.</p><p><a name="060517111000556">The framework is in place because, hopefully, no one can deny that there is progress towards a political  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1091</b><br>solution in Northern Ireland, however slow that might seem. The latest IMC report of 26 April states that the Provisional IRA leadership is committed to a peaceful path. There is work to be done and efforts to be undertaken, but we must realise that there is movement and that Northern Ireland today is unrecognisable from how it was at the height of the troubles in recent years.</p><p><a name="060517111000557">The Bill makes progress on the devolution of policing and criminal justice, but it does much more than that. It takes forward the modernisation of our electoral system so that we will be brought in line, over a staged period, with the rest of the United Kingdom&#146;s electoral law on political party funding. It also modernises the electoral canvass and allows for the appointment and operation of the chief electoral officer. Again, it does so to put Northern Ireland in a fair frame of progress towards proper elections and electoral law.</p><p><a name="060517111000558">The Bill also provides for an extension to the order-making power under the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997 to facilitate the continued decommissioning of loyalist weapons. That issue has been a major bone of contention today, but I will press, along with hon. Members on both sides of the House, especially the hon. Member for North Down(Lady Hermon) and DUP Members, for the decommissioning of loyalist weapons. The Bill puts in place a framework to give us extra time, should we need it.</p><p><a name="060517111000559">The Bill will also make important contributions to the existing criminal justice and policing regimes in Northern Ireland. It will give investigators and prosecutors new powers to tackle serious and organised crime. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who is new to his position, will be taking forward those measures in due course to ensure that we do what we say we will do, namely, crack down on organised crime and criminality in Northern Ireland. We will continue to take the effective steps that have been seen over the past few weeks to tackle the cross-border smuggling of petrol and cigarettes, and other problems.</p><p><a name="060517111000560">An issue close to the heart of the hon. Member for North Down is central to the Bill. The Bill provides corporation sole status to the office of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I gave her an assurance that we would do that when we were considering the on-the-runs legislation in Committee and, following her representations, we have done so. We have responded to her concerns, so&#151;dare I say?&#151;the Government have listened. We have also responded to other points that members of that Committee raised, albeit not all of them.</p>  <page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/debtext/60517-0167.htm"/>
+  <a name="060517111000684"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;I do not want a late pre-condition established on top of the absolutely correct demands that have been made of republicans that they decommission, that they end their paramilitary activity and they end their criminality.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000034">It would seem that the Secretary of State is sending a signal to Sinn Fein, saying &#147;You have done all these things, we are thankful, and we do not want to press you any further.&#148;</p><p><a name="060517111000035">Let me make it clear that this is not a new precondition. It is not an attempt to create a hurdle. It is a long-standing requirement. It is what was meant by the reference in the pledge of office to being committed to entirely democratic and peaceful means. That must involve upholding and supporting the police, which has not been done. It is therefore important for us to send the right signal.</p><p><a name="060517111000036">I take the point made by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan). I believe that this argument has been weakened somewhat by the activities of one of the  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1081</b><br>Unionist parties in Northern Ireland. At least in the House of Commons, even today, all who represent the Unionist tradition have made it clear that they envisage no role in Government for those who have been involved in terrorism.</p><p><a name="060517111000037">Only last week, when the Secretary of State appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) put on record what the IMC report had said in paragraphs 2.30 and 2.31 about the activities of the Ulster Volunteer Force. I will not read it out now, because time is short. Two days later, the hon. Lady was completely undermined by her own party, which seemed to have ignored all that the IMC had said because, in terms of ministerial posts, it was in its interests to do so. That was the reason given. At the weekend I conducted an interview with one of the party&#146;s leading negotiators, and that was the only reason he gave. He did not say that it would help the UUP to persuade the UVF to give up its guns and its criminality; he simply said that it would give the party an extra position should an Executive be established.</p><p><a name="060517111000038">I believe that that cynical exercise has, to an extent, undermined the position that the Unionists have adopted. I should make it clear, however, that we believe the same requirement should apply across the board. We cannot allow it to be weakened by the fact that some may have decided for cynical reasons to ally themselves with those whom the IMC has accused of being engaged in all kinds of criminal and terrorist activity.</p><p><a name="060517111000039">This is an important new clause. The Government must stop being ambivalent toward the behaviour of Sinn Fein and its associates, and toward that of others involved in terrorist activity. It does not matter whether or not the Minister includes this test in the Bill: we will apply it to Sinn Fein. It would be much better to include that test in the Bill, however, so that the clear message is sent to terrorists and to Sinn Fein that the whole democratic body of the United Kingdom supports the test and requires that it is met. But we will make the judgment, and as we have made clear today, if Sinn Fein persists in its refusal to back law and order and the police, and persists in its refusal to encourage those who are influenced by it to support the police, it will not be regarded as fit for government and will not be included in the Executive.</p><p><a name="060517111000040">The Minister is keen to have devolution in Northern Ireland by the end of November. The one way to ensure that that does not happen is to allow Sinn Fein to believe that it is not going to be pushed into doing the proper thing, the democratic thing, the right thing, which is to support the police, who will have to enforce the laws that they would wish to pass in an Executive.</p><p><a name="060517111000041"><b><a name="060517111000720">Mr. Hanson:</b> For the avoidance of any doubt, I say straight away to the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) that I will not be ambivalent in my comments on support for policing. This Government, the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) and I all believe that Sinn Fein should be involved in, sign up to and support policing, and that they should take their places on the Policing Board. I am not going  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1082</b><br>to defend in this House a situation in which attacks on schools could occur, or in which individuals are not encouraged to go to the police to ensure that information about rapes is passed on. I make it clear to the hon. Member for East Antrim and others that the Government look forward to the day when Sinn Fein members take their place on the Policing Board and all citizens of Northern Ireland respect and support policing in the community and at large.</p><p><a name="060517111000042">We share the aim of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)&#151;</p><p><a name="060517111000043"><b><a name="060517111000721">Dr. McCrea:</b> Let us be clear: simply joining the Policing Board is not the test; the test is actively supporting the actions of the security forces as they establish democracy, the rule of law and the end of criminality in Northern Ireland.</p><p><a name="060517111000044"><b><a name="060517111000722">Mr. Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman knows that I share those objectives.</p><p><a name="060517111000045"><b><a name="060517111000723">Dr. McCrea</b><i> indicated assent.</i></p><p><a name="060517111000046"><b><a name="060517111000724">Mr. Hanson:</b> I believe that everybody has the right to support the rule of law in that way. My problem with the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury relates to the ability to legislate according to it. First, it is important to put on the record that there is movement in the direction of travel that those who have spoken today want to see. In paragraph 2.19 of its 10th report, the Independent Monitoring Commission&#151;an independent body, not the Government or a political party represented in this House&#151;states:</p><a name="060517111000685"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;We believe that the leadership&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000047">of Sinn Fein and of the IRA</p><a name="060517111000686"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;has accepted the need to engage in policing if it is to achieve its aim of devolution of policing and justice to an Assembly and Executive in Northern Ireland. It has not...yet determined how this might be delivered&#148;,</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000048">but it has said that it wishes to see that direction of travel.</p><p><a name="060517111000049">Paragraph 2.13 of the report states:</p><a name="060517111000687"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It remains our absolutely clear view that the PIRA leadership has committed itself to following a peaceful path.&#148;</p></ul><p><a name="060517111000050">I recognise that there is more work to be done, and in my role as Minister I will do all that I can to ensure that that it is done. The hon. Member for East Antrim said that there is a problem of definition with the new clause, and that is the nub of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) intimated as much, because we cannot define what the rule of law means or what support for it means. We know the direction of travel in broad terms, but I cannot define it in legislation.</p><p><a name="060517111000051"><b><a name="060517111000725">Mr. Laurence Robertson:</b> The Minister will be aware that the word most often used in law is &#147;reasonable&#148;. It is not possible to define exactly what that means.</p><p><a name="060517111000052"><b><a name="060517111000726">Mr. Hanson:</b> I put my points to the House and that is one of the points that it is important to recognise. I draw the attention of hon. Members back to a point that I discussed earlier, which concerns the pledge of  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1083</b><br>office. The pledge of office in place at present ensures that all Ministers must affirm, before taking any post, a commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means. The current pledge of office can also be affected by IMC recommendations&#151;and that is an important point. For example, if a future IMC report determined that individuals or organisations were not acting in the spirit of the pledge of office, safeguards are in place so that action could be taken.</p><p><a name="060517111000053"><b><a name="060517111000727">Sir Patrick Cormack:</b> I have a high regard for the Minister, as he knows, but there are times when the Government have to behave with real firmness. We need the smack of firm Government. The Government must tell these people that unless they make such a pledge, there is no place for them in the Government of any part of the UK. If the Government do not do that, they will not achieve devolved Government in Northern Ireland&#151;which we want them to achieve.</p><p><a name="060517111000054"><b><a name="060517111000728">Mr. Hanson:</b> I reciprocate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sentiments, but he will understand that every hon. Member who has spoken today shares the same objective. I simply do not feel that legislating for it in the way proposed, with due respect to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury would achieve that end or, for the reasons of definition mentioned by the hon. Member for East Antrim, would be applicable.</p><p><a name="060517111000055"><b><a name="060517111000729">Rev. Ian Paisley:</b> The situation arose after those men had taken that pledge: they resorted to violence and some of them made statements justifying it. Why was nothing done then? The Government did not say that those men had to leave the Executive: they closed down the whole lot. I was accused of a sin and so were all the other Members, but those men were not.</p><p><a name="060517111000056"><b><a name="060517111000730">Mr. Hanson:</b> If the right hon. Gentleman is not happy with the current pledge of office and its operation&#151;I take it from his comments that he is not&#151;I have given a commitment previously, and I reaffirm it today, that we are happy to consider further legislation in due course on a stronger pledge of office, if such measures are produced by agreement as part of discussions of strand 1 issues. He will know that I am happy to discuss that and, in fact, I have sat across a table from his colleagues and raised the prospect with them.</p><p><a name="060517111000057">For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that the Government are committed to supporting the rule of law and the involvement of Sinn Fein and other interested parties in policing. That is essential, but the new clause would not assist in that process and I ask the hon. Member for Tewkesbury to withdraw it.</p><p><a name="060517111000058"><b><a name="060517111000731">Mr. Laurence Robertson:</b> Given the fact that we have to finish this debate in less than a minute, I do not have time to go through the various arguments that have been made. The new clause is not watertight, but no legislation is. However, as the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) said, it would be a significant move in the right direction if we were to adopt it. I therefore have no option but to press the new clause to a vote.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1084</b><br><p><a name="060517111000059"><i> Question put</i>, That the clause be read a Second time:&#151;</p><br><i> The House divided:</i> Ayes 193, Noes 274.<center><a name="060517112000593"><b>Division No. 244]</b></center>[6.00 pm<br><br><br><br>AYES<br><br>Afriyie, Adam<br>Ainsworth, Mr. Peter<br>Alexander, Danny<br>Amess, Mr. David<br>Ancram, rh Mr. Michael<br>Baldry, Tony<br>Baron, Mr. John<br>Barrett, John<br>Beith, rh Mr. Alan<br>Bellingham, Mr. Henry<br>Benyon, Mr. Richard<br>Bercow, John<br>Binley, Mr. Brian<br>Blunt, Mr. Crispin<br>Bone, Mr. Peter<br>Boswell, Mr. Tim<br>Brady, Mr. Graham<br>Brazier, Mr. Julian<br>Brokenshire, James<br>Browne, Mr. Jeremy<br>Burns, Mr. Simon<br>Burrowes, Mr. David<br>Burt, Alistair<br>Burt, Lorely<br>Butterfill, Sir John<br>Cable, Dr. Vincent<br>Campbell, Mr. Gregory<br>Campbell, rh Sir Menzies<br>Carmichael, Mr. Alistair<br>Carswell, Mr. Douglas<br>Cash, Mr. William<br>Clark, Greg<br>Clarke, rh Mr. Kenneth<br>Clegg, Mr. Nick<br>Clifton-Brown, Mr. Geoffrey<br>Cormack, Sir Patrick<br>Crabb, Mr. Stephen<br>Curry, rh Mr. David<br>Davies, David T.C. <i> (Monmouth)</i><br>Davies, Philip<br>Davies, Mr. Quentin<br>Djanogly, Mr. Jonathan<br>Dodds, Mr. Nigel<br>Donaldson, Mr. Jeffrey M.<br>Duncan, Mr. Alan<br>Duncan Smith, rh Mr. Iain<br>Dunne, Mr. Philip<br>Evans, Mr. Nigel<br>Fabricant, Michael<br>Fallon, Mr. Michael<br>Farron, Tim<br>Featherstone, Lynne<br>Field, Mr. Mark<br>Foster, Mr. Don<br>Fox, Dr. Liam<br>Francois, Mr. Mark<br>Garnier, Mr. Edward<br>Gauke, Mr. David<br>Gibb, Mr. Nick<br>Gidley, Sandra<br>Gillan, Mrs. Cheryl<br>Goldsworthy, Julia<br>Goodman, Mr. Paul<br>Goodwill, Mr. Robert<br>Gove, Michael<br>Gray, Mr. James<br>Grayling, Chris<br>Green, Damian<br>Greening, Justine<br>Grieve, Mr. Dominic<br>Gummer, rh Mr. John<br>Hammond, Mr. Philip<br>Hammond, Stephen<br>Harper, Mr. Mark<br>Harris, Dr. Evan<br>Harvey, Nick<br>Heath, Mr. David<br>Heathcoat-Amory, rh Mr. David<br>Hemming, John<br>Hendry, Charles<br>Herbert, Nick<br>Hermon, Lady<br>Hoban, Mr. Mark<br>Hollobone, Mr. Philip<br>Holmes, Paul<br>Horwood, Martin<br>Howard, rh Mr. Michael<br>Howarth, David<br>Howarth, Mr. Gerald<br>Hughes, Simon<br>Huhne, Chris<br>Hunt, Mr. Jeremy<br>Hunter, Mark<br>Jack, rh Mr. Michael<br>Jackson, Mr. Stewart<br>Jenkin, Mr. Bernard<br>Jones, Mr. David<br>Kawczynski, Daniel<br>Kennedy, rh Mr. Charles<br>Kirkbride, Miss Julie<br>Knight, rh Mr. Greg<br>Kramer, Susan<br>Lait, Mrs. Jacqui<br>Lamb, Norman<br>Lansley, Mr. Andrew<br>Laws, Mr. David<br>Leech, Mr. John<br>Letwin, rh Mr. Oliver<br>Lewis, Dr. Julian<br>Lidington, Mr. David<br>Lilley, rh Mr. Peter<br>Llwyd, Mr. Elfyn<br>Loughton, Tim<br>Luff, Peter<br>Mackay, rh Mr. Andrew<br>Maclean, rh David<br>Malins, Mr. Humfrey<br>Maples, Mr. John<br>Mates, rh Mr. Michael<br>May, rh Mrs. Theresa<br>McCrea, Dr. William<br>McIntosh, Miss Anne<br>McLoughlin, rh Mr. Patrick<br>Mercer, Patrick<br>Milton, Anne<br>Mitchell, Mr. Andrew <br>Moore, Mr. Michael<br>Moss, Mr. Malcolm  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><br>Mundell, David<br>Murrison, Dr. Andrew<br>Newmark, Mr. Brooks<br>O'Brien, Mr. Stephen<br>&#214;pik, Lembit<br>Osborne, Mr. George<br>Ottaway, Richard<br>Paisley, rh Rev.

to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p><a name="060517111000552">We have had a positive debate<i> &#151;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p><p><a name="060517111000553"><b><a name="060517111001204">Mr. Deputy Speaker (Sir Michael Lord):</b> Order. If hon. Members are not staying for the debate, could they leave quickly and quietly?</p><p><a name="060517111000554"><b><a name="060517111001205">Mr. Hanson:</b> Over the course of its consideration, on Second Reading, in Committee&#151;particularly given that there was a Committee of the whole House&#151;and on Report, we have had a useful discussion about the principles of the Bill. I commend right hon. and hon. Members on their valuable contributions to today&#146;s debate. Contrary to assertions made by Members, the Government have listened to some of the points that have been made and have tabled amendments that have made a material difference to the nature of the Bill. As with every piece of legislation, it is not possible to accept every amendment or every point made in the debate. There will be differences between us, but I have moved on several points and I am pleased to see that those have been incorporated in the Third Reading of the Bill.</p><a name="060517111000675"><p>As right hon. and hon. Members will know, there is a clear path open to us now on Northern Ireland&#146;s political development to ensure that, as has been stated by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, by the end of 2006 we bring about clear political progress for the political organisations in Northern Ireland and for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland. It is now for local politicians to take forward that task of devolution. I am pleased that we are meeting today, in the week that the Assembly reconvened following the passing of earlier legislation; that we have in place Assembly Members who are signed up again to take part in the Assembly; and that we had debates on the Floor of the Assembly this week, with participation from Members from across the Assembly. I believe, as do the Government, that the Assembly offers a better future for Northern Ireland. Now, through the Bill, we are in a position to take forward the possible next stages of devolution in Northern Ireland by devolving criminal justice and policing.</p><p><a name="060517111000555">Given what has been said today, no one fails to accept that there are still major hurdles to overcome and that work must be done, not least to get the proper Executive-led Assembly back in place by November. Additionally, difficulties are self-evident to anyone who has been involved in our debates on the possible devolution of criminal justice and policing. However, the Bill sets a clear path before the House: devolution in October or November&#151;I hope&#151;at the very latest with the Executive back in place. At some point in the future, we will have the framework and opportunity for the devolution of criminal justice and policing. For the sake of having the discussion again, the famous triple&#151;or perhaps now even quadruple&#151;lock is in place whereby the Assembly, the Secretary of State and the Government must agree with the House of Commons if such devolution is to take place. In all essence, however, the framework is in place.</p><p><a name="060517111000556">The framework is in place because, hopefully, no one can deny that there is progress towards a political  <br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1091</b><br>solution in Northern Ireland, however slow that might seem. The latest IMC report of 26 April states that the Provisional IRA leadership is committed to a peaceful path. There is work to be done and efforts to be undertaken, but we must realise that there is movement and that Northern Ireland today is unrecognisable from how it was at the height of the troubles in recent years.</p><p><a name="060517111000557">The Bill makes progress on the devolution of policing and criminal justice, but it does much more than that. It takes forward the modernisation of our electoral system so that we will be brought in line, over a staged period, with the rest of the United Kingdom&#146;s electoral law on political party funding. It also modernises the electoral canvass and allows for the appointment and operation of the chief electoral officer. Again, it does so to put Northern Ireland in a fair frame of progress towards proper elections and electoral law.</p><p><a name="060517111000558">The Bill also provides for an extension to the order-making power under the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997 to facilitate the continued decommissioning of loyalist weapons. That issue has been a major bone of contention today, but I will press, along with hon. Members on both sides of the House, especially the hon. Member for North Down(Lady Hermon) and DUP Members, for the decommissioning of loyalist weapons. The Bill puts in place a framework to give us extra time, should we need it.</p><p><a name="060517111000559">The Bill will also make important contributions to the existing criminal justice and policing regimes in Northern Ireland. It will give investigators and prosecutors new powers to tackle serious and organised crime. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who is new to his position, will be taking forward those measures in due course to ensure that we do what we say we will do, namely, crack down on organised crime and criminality in Northern Ireland. We will continue to take the effective steps that have been seen over the past few weeks to tackle the cross-border smuggling of petrol and cigarettes, and other problems.</p><p><a name="060517111000560">An issue close to the heart of the hon. Member for North Down is central to the Bill. The Bill provides corporation sole status to the office of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I gave her an assurance that we would do that when we were considering the on-the-runs legislation in Committee and, following her representations, we have done so. We have responded to her concerns, so&#151;dare I say?&#151;the Government have listened. We have also responded to other points that members of that Committee raised, albeit not all of them.</p>  <page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060517/debtext/60517-0167.htm"/>
