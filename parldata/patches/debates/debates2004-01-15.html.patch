  I am sure that the letter also pointed out that there has been an increase of 47.9 per cent. in funding for pupils in North Yorkshire under the Government, in contrast to the cuts that occurred when the Conservative party was in power.

  (Lab): First, may I say how grateful my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham) and I are to Mr. Speaker for granting the debate? My hon. Friend wishes to contribute to the debate, although we are both conscious that we must allow time for the Minister to respond.

  I take my hon. Friend's argument that it is difficult for him to reply to some points but when it comes to even-handedness, that is precisely the subject of our principal charge against the trust. It has not been even-handed. Dr. Mattu made a number of serious allegations against other people working in the hospital but they have not been investigated. Nobody else has been suspended. Equally, the charges against Dr. Gieowarsingh remain on the table. They have not been properly investigated and the trust refuses to do anything about them.

  Even-handedness is important but I challenge some of my hon. Friend's interpretation of events.
