- It is true. The council states that there exists a 12th-century charter, given by a 12th-century king&#151;it could have been Henry II or possibly even the wicked King John&#151;that allows Leicester city, which presumably refers to a predecessor of Leicester city council rather than the current organisation, to impose restrictions on markets to be held close to the city centre. I should stress that nobody can find the charter, although allegedly a copy exists. Leicester city council believes that it is allowed to ban any market within 6<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> miles of the city market. I do not know how that slightly odd measurement came about, because after all measurements were made in miles and furlongs.</p>

- As I was saying, in medieval times, measurements were made in miles and furlongs rather than <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> miles, which does not quite fit in. Furthermore, the copy of the charter makes no mention of a distance from the city centre. It is suggested that 6<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> miles is the distance that a herd of cattle could be driven in a day or a decent walk for a medieval villein, serf or peasant&#151;I would have thought that they could have gone a bit further, but never mind.</p>
