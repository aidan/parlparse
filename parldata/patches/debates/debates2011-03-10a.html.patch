  Order. I am sorry to disappoint colleagues, but this topical questions session is always a rather shorter one, and demand has exceeded supply. We must now move on to questions to Minister for Women and Equalities.</p>

  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for giving me an opportunity to respond to today's important debate. I notice on the Order Paper that this afternoon the House had the opportunity to consider the question, "What do Ministers do?" The House might find it helpful, therefore, to know that the Minister for Europe, at this very moment, is meeting the Danish State Secretary and other parliamentarians in Copenhagen to discuss the Danish presidency of the European Union in 2012, and other EU and NATO issues. That is why, despite not having specific departmental responsibilities for Europe, I have the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Foreign Office this afternoon.</p>
