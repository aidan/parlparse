They committed an offence&#151;the <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>courts said it was an offence&#151;in the course of combating terrorism. I must tell the hon. Member for Foyle that they were fine Guardsmen, sent to Northern Ireland by a Government under extreme pressure. He is entitled to quote what the court said and he might be right that the offences happened, but those Guardsmen were not colluding with terrorists and cannot be equated to members of the UVF, LVF, IRA and all the other people who committed murder.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan</b> <i>rose&#151;</i></p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman giving way?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> No, I was trying to clarify the point about new clause 2 and the difference between collusion and offences that happen in the act of combating terrorism; they are not always one and the same. That is a good point to make in support of that argument.</p><p align=left>It is also important that we reaffirm the anonymity of individuals who may come before the special tribunal. I object to the Bill completely, but I am not going to go down the course of saying that I object, so I am not going to support any amendments and I am not going to take part in the debate. I know that the Government are intent on pushing the Bill through, so we should try to get at least a Bill that protects some of the members of the security forces.</p><p align=left>We should be under no illusion that the paramilitary organisations of all colours and persuasion often use courts to find their future targets.It does not matter whether they call themselves PIRA one week and the next they call themselves the Irish National Liberation Army or Continuity IRA, they have long memories. Many people would like to settle scores that go back to the 80s and 70s. If we do not have a strong affirmation in the Bill that if the security forces have to come within its remit, they will be able to remain anonymous, we will do a disservice to those members of the security forces who were sent by the Government to do the job. They did not rush over. They were sent to do a certain job. It is important that their identities are protected in the future.</p><p align=left>The hon. Member for Foyle has yet to answer the question&#151;</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan</b> <i>rose&#151;</i></p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> I will let the hon. Gentleman answer when I have finished the question. Members of a terrorist organisation could be covered by the Bill and let off, but members of the security forces could not. Does he prefer the security forces not to be covered by the Bill?</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> I am happy that the hon. Gentleman has given me the chance to answer the question. The soldiers in the case of Peter McBride were not acting to counter terrorism any more than the paratroopers who shot dead 13 people in Derry on Bloody Sunday were acting to counter terrorism. No one could accept that they were.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 30</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>As for the collusion question, collusion with whom? The defence for security forces and intelligence force personnel working with agents inside paramilitary groups is that they are doing so to combat terrorism. The defence for those agents inside paramilitary groups who carried out crime after crime and were given licence to do so by their handlers was that they had to be allowed to do that for the greater cause of combating terrorism. Collusion has always justified itself by the pretence that it was combating terrorism. We must remember that the reference in the new clause to &#147;efforts to combat terrorism&#148; would not apply to security forces alone; it would apply to anyone who could claim that he was combating terrorism. People inside paramilitary organisations, who because they were agents were committing all sorts of crimes, could claim that. It is not only members of the security forces who could claim the benefit under the clause. People inside paramilitary organisations&#151;and not only loyalist groups&#151;could do so.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> Someone inside a terrorist organisation, whether or not an informer, can claim a get-out-of-jail-free card under the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has yet to state whether or not he wants members of the security forces to be covered by the exemption, or does he want it only for the terrorists who did all the murdering in the vast majority of cases in Northern Ireland? Will he answer the question? He is yet to answer it.</p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> Before the hon. Member for Foyle does so, I suggest that his answer is brief. Interventions and answers are becoming almost short speeches. I hope that we make some progress.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> Again, I must say that I want the provision for no one. I do not know how many times that I have to make that point. I want the provision for no one. I will hold the Government to their original claim that the Bill is about on-the-runs who are outside the Northern Ireland jurisdiction. It is not a matter of terrorists or anyone else&#151;I know some on-the-runs who I believe to be innocent. I will hold the Government to their claims not because I want the Bill or because I regard it as a priority, but because I want to test the dishonesty of the Government.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will use between now and the end of our proceedings to answer the question.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Mark Hendrick</b> (Preston) (Lab/Co-op): He has answered it.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> He has not. The hon. Gentleman has said that he does not believe that the Bill should exist. Well, join the club. He has said that he wants to hold the Government to account. Here we have a new clause that, if we have to have the Bill, would allow the security forces to be given some protection. Either the hon. Gentleman supports it or not.</p><p align=left>New clause 2 is important. Amendment No. 111 is designed simply to elicit some clarity from the Government. I hope that the Committee will support the new clause as I do.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 31</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Lembit &Ouml;pik:</b> I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution. It seems contradictory to support amendment No. 111 as well as the new clause. New clause 2 could be interpreted by a court as&#151;to use the line that we have been using&#151;a get-out-of-jail-free card, since it includes a paragraph about the applicant being</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;accused of an offence committed in the course of efforts to combat terrorism in Northern Ireland&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>How does he square what seems to be a contradiction between the two amendments?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> My understanding, although I may be corrected by the Minister, is that an offence committed in the course of combating terrorism may not be an offence related to terrorism. It might therefore be important to show a distinction in the Bill.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who was about to sit down but graciously took my intervention. May I just point out that the present Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which incorporated the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Sir Hugh Orde, is on record as having said that he does not welcome the inclusion of police officers in the Bill? How would the hon. Gentleman try to persuade him that it is acceptable for them to be covered by it?</p><h4>12.15 pm</h4><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> First, I have said that the Bill is not acceptable, but we must consider the Government&#146;s track record of decisions about how to treat members of the security forces after legislation or agreements have been established. The two Scots Guardsmen that we discussed should, if matters are as the hon. Member for Foyle believes, continue to serve their sentence. They committed an offence&#151;a crime. However, the Government packaged them up and dealt with them along with paramilitary releases. The point is at least to understand that if such people are included in the Bill the Government cannot wriggle out of their views on how the security forces should or should not be dealt with.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be incomprehensible if the Bill was passed and the security forces were removed from it? Terrorists would get a get-out-of-jail-free card and some hon. Members would be quite content if in those circumstances, police officers and soldiers had to go through the full process of the law. That would show the twisted thinking that led to the discriminatory 50:50 recruitment policy for the police. People welcomed the Patten report and all that came with it, then all of a sudden they got a lot of other things, because they did not think straight.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> I have very strong views on the existence of the Bill. It is best to leave the matter by saying that I sincerely hope that it will not succeed in either House. However, if it is to pass it is our duty as Members of Parliament to protect constituents who are members of the security forces from having their identity released&#151;the Bill at present only gives <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>discretion to the tribunal and does not specify that their identity should be protected&#151;and to ensure that those people receive treatment that is as fair as possible.</p><p align=left>It would be completely unfair if, after the Bill was enacted, convicted mass murderers could walk round cocking a snook while members of the security forces underwent the full rigour of the judicial system. There would be one judicial system for terrorists and one for the others. Fairness is what helps to solve the injustice that caused the whole mess for decades and centuries in Northern Ireland. If we want to create more injustices we should go ahead with the Bill. We shall then find terrorists from another group of society and we will have to go through the whole procedure again. The Bill is a Bill too far. It will be unfair if one group of people is included in it and one group is outside it. I support the amendment and the new clause and hope that the Committee will do so too.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, who has brought his experiences in Northern Ireland to bear on the debate.</p><p align=left>This is an evil Bill. That is not my description of it. It is the description of the Minister who will steer it through another place. On &#147;Hearts and Minds&#148; last Thursday evening, he described the Bill as evil but said that it was none the less necessary. We face a series of conundrums, conflicts and contradictions in attempting in Committee to deal with a Bill that is described even by its promoter as evil. All Opposition Members and some Labour Members voted against it on Second Reading. I suspect that they will all vote against it on Third Reading too. Our job in Committee is to attempt, as far as possible, to blunt or dilute the main elements of the Bill and to make it less unacceptable than it was when it entered Committee. That is all that we can do, but doing that will undoubtedly raise certain issues which conflict with hon. Members real desire, which is to have the Bill defeated in its entirety.</p><p align=left>Having said that, I recall when the Government entered into this shabby deal. The hon. Member for Foyle suggested that the Government have changed their position since they produced their proposals back in 2003. That is not the case. Back in 2003, my colleagues and I read the schedule that was produced&#151;the annex to the joint declaration&#151;and rightly divined its implications. If anyone looks at the annex today and compares it to the Bill, they will see that nothing in the Bill contradicts the statement that came out in 2003. Back then, the Government indicated that the legislation would set out who and which offences would qualify for the scheme. Now we see who and which, but because some hon. Members were focusing on a different element of the problem, they did not see what the Government might have had in mind for a later stage.</p><p align=left>I have no doubt that the Government knew immediately that theirs would be an untenable position. Having committed the first evil&#151;that of introducing legislation to ensure that people who had committed offences would not serve a day in prison for them&#151;they knew it would be untenable for them to <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>argue that only terrorists should benefit from that, and that those in the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre would not.</p><p align=left>I do not share the position of the hon. Member for Foyle&#151;that because the actual offence was not committed in the course of combating terrorism, it does not fit within new clause 2. The new clause refers to offences committed in the course of combating terrorism. The men in question were there to combat terrorism and, unquestionably, they made an error of judgement. The courts have determined that, but will anyone tell me that people who were there in order to combat terrorism and made an error of judgment, even if they attempted to cover up their involvement later, are in some way as bad or, in the case made by the hon. Member for Foyle, worse than the terrorists and should not benefit as the terrorists do? It would be absurd if the Government took that position.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. However, it echoes our argument about the phrase</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;(whether committed for terrorist purposes or not)&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>The hon. Gentleman is saying that any crime committed by a member of the security forces in Northern Ireland could be covered, because they were only there to combat terrorism, just as the phrase in parentheses means that any crime committed by anyone claiming to be a paramilitary would be covered. That is the argument that the hon. Gentleman is making&#151;that the act does not have to be combating terrorism, just that the individuals in question were there to combat terrorism so any crime that they committed would be covered.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> Let us be clear: the legislation talks about</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;terrorism and the affairs of Northern Ireland&#148;,</ul></p><p align=left>so it must be linked to the terrorist situation. I have no doubt that the soldiers were standing on the road attempting to combat terrorism. Thinking that they were confronting terrorists, they took action without taking into account all of the issues that they should have, and the consequence was that an innocent person was killed, as the hon. Gentleman says. It was an offence, and was judged to be that by the court. My question is: why would the hon. Gentleman think that someone who makes a mistake like that should not benefit from this legislation, but that terrorists who set out to do someone to death in the most vile way possible should benefit? I do not think that that argument can be made to stand up.</p><p align=left>The Government decided that the legislation is necessary and were therefore forced to go down the second path and provide that it should benefit members of the security forces. I do not agree with the argument about collusion. Anybody who has been involved in collusion falls into the category of being a supporter of a paramilitary organisation and should be treated in the same way as those who are supporters of terrorist organisations. The Minister knows that the House was unhappy about the equivalence being drawn between terrorists and members of the security forces. Unless he introduces separate legislation, I do <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>not think that he can address that in the way that Opposition Members want it to be dealt with. But if he is going to deal with it in the Bill, at least let there be a new provision, separate from the provision for terrorists. That is all that the new clause is intended to achieve; we want offences committed by those in the security forces to be separated out from terrorist offences.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman kindly take a look at the wording of new clause 2? It states in respect of applications</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;made to the certification commissioner for a certificate of eligibility&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>that a certificate must be issued if</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant is accused of an offence committed in the course of efforts to combat terrorism&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>That is drafted so widely that it would benefit not just members of the security forces, but paramilitary informants. The argument that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have tried to advance is that new clause 2 separates the terrorists from the security forces. As currently drafted, it does no such thing.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s problem is that she reads the new clause as if it were the whole Bill. If she looks at clause 3(3), she will see the conditions that will apply to the new clause.</p><p align=left>Let me follow up the comments made by the hon. Member for Foyle in relation to the Superintendents Association. He questioned the conclusions that my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley reached in respect of the Superintendents Association letter. The letter expresses concern at</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;The odious linkage, indeed equivalence, which had been drawn between terrorist subjects who have fled justice and serving/former police officers who, the Secretary of State and others have indicated, may also &#145;benefit&#146; from the enactment of the draft legislation&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>It is very clear that the Superintendents Association was concerned about the equivalence. I do not pretend that the new clause would remove it entirely, but it does create further distance from the terrorist provisions in the legislation. On that basis, I urge hon. Members to support the new clause.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> May I bring to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention the fact that, according to clause 3, in order to benefit an applicant must be capable of being arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;but for the fact that he was believed to be outside the United Kingdom&#148;?</ul></p><p align=left>How many police officers does the hon. Gentleman imagine are on the run outside the jurisdiction of the UK? How many does he think could benefit from new clause 2?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> The hon. Lady should spend a bit more time reading the legislation. It is not just for those who have gone outside the UK; it will benefit those who are not on the run at all. If she does nothing else, she should read the letter from the Superintendents Association. I will pass it on to her. The letter&#146;s first point is that the legislation has been broadened to include those who were never on the run. Even the most cursory reading of the legislation would <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>have made it clear to the hon. Lady that the legislation goes well beyond those who are outside the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and that it would benefit those who have not been charged but who remain in Northern Ireland. It is, in fact, a get-out-of-jail card for anybody who before 10 April 1998 committed an offence that was related to terrorism and the affairs of Northern Ireland, not just for those who have fled the country.</p><h4>12.30 pm</h4><p align=left>In closing, may I say that offences of the kind that have been committed in Northern Ireland are so serious that the House should be very careful before it lends its hand to such a Bill? It would find itself in the most absurd position if it attempted to achieve an equivalence between those who are terrorists&#151;who sought to destroy our society&#151;and those in Northern Ireland who attempted to defend society, but made an error of judgment. The new clause, by providing a distinction between the two in separate provisions, would further distance the security forces from those who are the terrorists&#146; representatives. I urge the Committee to accept it.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): I must ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that we have spent an hour and a half on this first small group of amendments. I urge him to recognise that while we on the Opposition Benches may have disagreements&#151;indeed, considerable disagreements with the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)&#151;our real disagreement is with the Bill. These proposals force us to reflect on which criminal offences, often involving murder, will be given a certificate, or the so-called get-out-of-jail-free card, and which will not. As a new Member of the House, I find it offensive to have to make such a judgment in my first Standing Committee.</p><p align=left>I ask the Minister for clarification of a point in new clause 2 and its implications. The Opposition have debated whether this measure should apply to members of the security forces who colluded with terrorist organisations. Will the Bill allow a certificate to be granted to members of the security forces who colluded with members of paramilitary or terrorist organisations? If so, is not that utterly insulting to members of the security forces who joined precisely because they want to uphold the law? Not only that&#151;they are prepared to risk their lives in doing so.</p><p align=left> That is why the Superintendents Association and members of the security forces are the strongest opponents of giving certificates to people who join the security forces and breach that fundamental tenet of what the security forces are all about. On the other hand&#151;this is the absurdity of it&#151;if the Bill will not offer certificates to members of the security forces who have colluded with paramilitaries, can the Minister explain why he is prepared to give certificates to the people who committed terrorist acts, but not to those members of the security forces who may have colluded with them?</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 36</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> As the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) pointed out, this has been a very full debate on a range of issues, and I recognise the strength of feeling surrounding the context of the legislation. One does not have to be a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office, as I have been since May, to know of the great concern over aspects of the Bill. I fully recognise the legitimacy of hon. Members from both sides of the Committee who oppose the Bill and the strength of feeling that they brought to their opposition on Second Reading. However, the legislation received a Second Reading by a majority of 48 and is now in Committee.</p><p align=left>The purpose of consideration in Committee is to explore the issues in preparation for consideration on Report and Third Reading, and for an interesting passage through the House of Lords. I recognise the frustration that the hon. Member for South-West Surrey feels about his first Standing Committee sitting. I know that it exists, having served on far too many Committees and having spent five years in opposition, but that is the nature of the business we are in. During debates, I listen to what hon. Members have to say and explain the Government&#146;s position. As we progress, I shall reflect on what has been said in Committee so that we can consider such matters.</p><p align=left>The Government did not put this package together from ideas that were pulled from nowhere. We decided on it over time because we believe that it is in the long-term interests of peace in Northern Ireland.

+</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> In fact, I was pointing out that whether they perjured themselves, robbed banks or whatever, those two Guardsmen were not colluding with terrorists. They committed an offence&#151;the <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>courts said it was an offence&#151;in the course of combating terrorism. I must tell the hon. Member for Foyle that they were fine Guardsmen, sent to Northern Ireland by a Government under extreme pressure. He is entitled to quote what the court said and he might be right that the offences happened, but those Guardsmen were not colluding with terrorists and cannot be equated to members of the UVF, LVF, IRA and all the other people who committed murder.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan</b> <i>rose&#151;</i></p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman giving way?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> No, I was trying to clarify the point about new clause 2 and the difference between collusion and offences that happen in the act of combating terrorism; they are not always one and the same. That is a good point to make in support of that argument.</p><p align=left>It is also important that we reaffirm the anonymity of individuals who may come before the special tribunal. I object to the Bill completely, but I am not going to go down the course of saying that I object, so I am not going to support any amendments and I am not going to take part in the debate. I know that the Government are intent on pushing the Bill through, so we should try to get at least a Bill that protects some of the members of the security forces.</p><p align=left>We should be under no illusion that the paramilitary organisations of all colours and persuasion often use courts to find their future targets.It does not matter whether they call themselves PIRA one week and the next they call themselves the Irish National Liberation Army or Continuity IRA, they have long memories. Many people would like to settle scores that go back to the 80s and 70s. If we do not have a strong affirmation in the Bill that if the security forces have to come within its remit, they will be able to remain anonymous, we will do a disservice to those members of the security forces who were sent by the Government to do the job. They did not rush over. They were sent to do a certain job. It is important that their identities are protected in the future.</p><p align=left>The hon. Member for Foyle has yet to answer the question&#151;</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan</b> <i>rose&#151;</i></p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> I will let the hon. Gentleman answer when I have finished the question. Members of a terrorist organisation could be covered by the Bill and let off, but members of the security forces could not. Does he prefer the security forces not to be covered by the Bill?</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> I am happy that the hon. Gentleman has given me the chance to answer the question. The soldiers in the case of Peter McBride were not acting to counter terrorism any more than the paratroopers who shot dead 13 people in Derry on Bloody Sunday were acting to counter terrorism. No one could accept that they were.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 30</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>As for the collusion question, collusion with whom? The defence for security forces and intelligence force personnel working with agents inside paramilitary groups is that they are doing so to combat terrorism. The defence for those agents inside paramilitary groups who carried out crime after crime and were given licence to do so by their handlers was that they had to be allowed to do that for the greater cause of combating terrorism. Collusion has always justified itself by the pretence that it was combating terrorism. We must remember that the reference in the new clause to &#147;efforts to combat terrorism&#148; would not apply to security forces alone; it would apply to anyone who could claim that he was combating terrorism. People inside paramilitary organisations, who because they were agents were committing all sorts of crimes, could claim that. It is not only members of the security forces who could claim the benefit under the clause. People inside paramilitary organisations&#151;and not only loyalist groups&#151;could do so.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> Someone inside a terrorist organisation, whether or not an informer, can claim a get-out-of-jail-free card under the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has yet to state whether or not he wants members of the security forces to be covered by the exemption, or does he want it only for the terrorists who did all the murdering in the vast majority of cases in Northern Ireland? Will he answer the question? He is yet to answer it.</p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> Before the hon. Member for Foyle does so, I suggest that his answer is brief. Interventions and answers are becoming almost short speeches. I hope that we make some progress.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> Again, I must say that I want the provision for no one. I do not know how many times that I have to make that point. I want the provision for no one. I will hold the Government to their original claim that the Bill is about on-the-runs who are outside the Northern Ireland jurisdiction. It is not a matter of terrorists or anyone else&#151;I know some on-the-runs who I believe to be innocent. I will hold the Government to their claims not because I want the Bill or because I regard it as a priority, but because I want to test the dishonesty of the Government.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will use between now and the end of our proceedings to answer the question.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Mark Hendrick</b> (Preston) (Lab/Co-op): He has answered it.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> He has not. The hon. Gentleman has said that he does not believe that the Bill should exist. Well, join the club. He has said that he wants to hold the Government to account. Here we have a new clause that, if we have to have the Bill, would allow the security forces to be given some protection. Either the hon. Gentleman supports it or not.</p><p align=left>New clause 2 is important. Amendment No. 111 is designed simply to elicit some clarity from the Government. I hope that the Committee will support the new clause as I do.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 31</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Lembit &ouml;pik:</b> I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution. It seems contradictory to support amendment No. 111 as well as the new clause. New clause 2 could be interpreted by a court as&#151;to use the line that we have been using&#151;a get-out-of-jail-free card, since it includes a paragraph about the applicant being</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;accused of an offence committed in the course of efforts to combat terrorism in Northern Ireland&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>How does he square what seems to be a contradiction between the two amendments?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> My understanding, although I may be corrected by the Minister, is that an offence committed in the course of combating terrorism may not be an offence related to terrorism. It might therefore be important to show a distinction in the Bill.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who was about to sit down but graciously took my intervention. May I just point out that the present Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which incorporated the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Sir Hugh Orde, is on record as having said that he does not welcome the inclusion of police officers in the Bill? How would the hon. Gentleman try to persuade him that it is acceptable for them to be covered by it?</p><h4>12.15 pm</h4><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> First, I have said that the Bill is not acceptable, but we must consider the Government&#146;s track record of decisions about how to treat members of the security forces after legislation or agreements have been established. The two Scots Guardsmen that we discussed should, if matters are as the hon. Member for Foyle believes, continue to serve their sentence. They committed an offence&#151;a crime. However, the Government packaged them up and dealt with them along with paramilitary releases. The point is at least to understand that if such people are included in the Bill the Government cannot wriggle out of their views on how the security forces should or should not be dealt with.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be incomprehensible if the Bill was passed and the security forces were removed from it? Terrorists would get a get-out-of-jail-free card and some hon. Members would be quite content if in those circumstances, police officers and soldiers had to go through the full process of the law. That would show the twisted thinking that led to the discriminatory 50:50 recruitment policy for the police. People welcomed the Patten report and all that came with it, then all of a sudden they got a lot of other things, because they did not think straight.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Wallace:</b> I have very strong views on the existence of the Bill. It is best to leave the matter by saying that I sincerely hope that it will not succeed in either House. However, if it is to pass it is our duty as Members of Parliament to protect constituents who are members of the security forces from having their identity released&#151;the Bill at present only gives <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>discretion to the tribunal and does not specify that their identity should be protected&#151;and to ensure that those people receive treatment that is as fair as possible.</p><p align=left>It would be completely unfair if, after the Bill was enacted, convicted mass murderers could walk round cocking a snook while members of the security forces underwent the full rigour of the judicial system. There would be one judicial system for terrorists and one for the others. Fairness is what helps to solve the injustice that caused the whole mess for decades and centuries in Northern Ireland. If we want to create more injustices we should go ahead with the Bill. We shall then find terrorists from another group of society and we will have to go through the whole procedure again. The Bill is a Bill too far. It will be unfair if one group of people is included in it and one group is outside it. I support the amendment and the new clause and hope that the Committee will do so too.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> I am delighted to follow the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, who has brought his experiences in Northern Ireland to bear on the debate.</p><p align=left>This is an evil Bill. That is not my description of it. It is the description of the Minister who will steer it through another place. On &#147;Hearts and Minds&#148; last Thursday evening, he described the Bill as evil but said that it was none the less necessary. We face a series of conundrums, conflicts and contradictions in attempting in Committee to deal with a Bill that is described even by its promoter as evil. All Opposition Members and some Labour Members voted against it on Second Reading. I suspect that they will all vote against it on Third Reading too. Our job in Committee is to attempt, as far as possible, to blunt or dilute the main elements of the Bill and to make it less unacceptable than it was when it entered Committee. That is all that we can do, but doing that will undoubtedly raise certain issues which conflict with hon. Members real desire, which is to have the Bill defeated in its entirety.</p><p align=left>Having said that, I recall when the Government entered into this shabby deal. The hon. Member for Foyle suggested that the Government have changed their position since they produced their proposals back in 2003. That is not the case. Back in 2003, my colleagues and I read the schedule that was produced&#151;the annex to the joint declaration&#151;and rightly divined its implications. If anyone looks at the annex today and compares it to the Bill, they will see that nothing in the Bill contradicts the statement that came out in 2003. Back then, the Government indicated that the legislation would set out who and which offences would qualify for the scheme. Now we see who and which, but because some hon. Members were focusing on a different element of the problem, they did not see what the Government might have had in mind for a later stage.</p><p align=left>I have no doubt that the Government knew immediately that theirs would be an untenable position. Having committed the first evil&#151;that of introducing legislation to ensure that people who had committed offences would not serve a day in prison for them&#151;they knew it would be untenable for them to <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>argue that only terrorists should benefit from that, and that those in the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre would not.</p><p align=left>I do not share the position of the hon. Member for Foyle&#151;that because the actual offence was not committed in the course of combating terrorism, it does not fit within new clause 2. The new clause refers to offences committed in the course of combating terrorism. The men in question were there to combat terrorism and, unquestionably, they made an error of judgement. The courts have determined that, but will anyone tell me that people who were there in order to combat terrorism and made an error of judgment, even if they attempted to cover up their involvement later, are in some way as bad or, in the case made by the hon. Member for Foyle, worse than the terrorists and should not benefit as the terrorists do? It would be absurd if the Government took that position.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. However, it echoes our argument about the phrase</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;(whether committed for terrorist purposes or not)&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>The hon. Gentleman is saying that any crime committed by a member of the security forces in Northern Ireland could be covered, because they were only there to combat terrorism, just as the phrase in parentheses means that any crime committed by anyone claiming to be a paramilitary would be covered. That is the argument that the hon. Gentleman is making&#151;that the act does not have to be combating terrorism, just that the individuals in question were there to combat terrorism so any crime that they committed would be covered.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> Let us be clear: the legislation talks about</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;terrorism and the affairs of Northern Ireland&#148;,</ul></p><p align=left>so it must be linked to the terrorist situation. I have no doubt that the soldiers were standing on the road attempting to combat terrorism. Thinking that they were confronting terrorists, they took action without taking into account all of the issues that they should have, and the consequence was that an innocent person was killed, as the hon. Gentleman says. It was an offence, and was judged to be that by the court. My question is: why would the hon. Gentleman think that someone who makes a mistake like that should not benefit from this legislation, but that terrorists who set out to do someone to death in the most vile way possible should benefit? I do not think that that argument can be made to stand up.</p><p align=left>The Government decided that the legislation is necessary and were therefore forced to go down the second path and provide that it should benefit members of the security forces. I do not agree with the argument about collusion. Anybody who has been involved in collusion falls into the category of being a supporter of a paramilitary organisation and should be treated in the same way as those who are supporters of terrorist organisations. The Minister knows that the House was unhappy about the equivalence being drawn between terrorists and members of the security forces. Unless he introduces separate legislation, I do <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>not think that he can address that in the way that Opposition Members want it to be dealt with. But if he is going to deal with it in the Bill, at least let there be a new provision, separate from the provision for terrorists. That is all that the new clause is intended to achieve; we want offences committed by those in the security forces to be separated out from terrorist offences.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman kindly take a look at the wording of new clause 2? It states in respect of applications</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;made to the certification commissioner for a certificate of eligibility&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>that a certificate must be issued if</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant is accused of an offence committed in the course of efforts to combat terrorism&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>That is drafted so widely that it would benefit not just members of the security forces, but paramilitary informants. The argument that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have tried to advance is that new clause 2 separates the terrorists from the security forces. As currently drafted, it does no such thing.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s problem is that she reads the new clause as if it were the whole Bill. If she looks at clause 3(3), she will see the conditions that will apply to the new clause.</p><p align=left>Let me follow up the comments made by the hon. Member for Foyle in relation to the Superintendents Association. He questioned the conclusions that my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley reached in respect of the Superintendents Association letter. The letter expresses concern at</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;The odious linkage, indeed equivalence, which had been drawn between terrorist subjects who have fled justice and serving/former police officers who, the Secretary of State and others have indicated, may also &#145;benefit&#146; from the enactment of the draft legislation&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>It is very clear that the Superintendents Association was concerned about the equivalence. I do not pretend that the new clause would remove it entirely, but it does create further distance from the terrorist provisions in the legislation. On that basis, I urge hon. Members to support the new clause.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> May I bring to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention the fact that, according to clause 3, in order to benefit an applicant must be capable of being arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;but for the fact that he was believed to be outside the United Kingdom&#148;?</ul></p><p align=left>How many police officers does the hon. Gentleman imagine are on the run outside the jurisdiction of the UK? How many does he think could benefit from new clause 2?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> The hon. Lady should spend a bit more time reading the legislation. It is not just for those who have gone outside the UK; it will benefit those who are not on the run at all. If she does nothing else, she should read the letter from the Superintendents Association. I will pass it on to her. The letter&#146;s first point is that the legislation has been broadened to include those who were never on the run. Even the most cursory reading of the legislation would <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>have made it clear to the hon. Lady that the legislation goes well beyond those who are outside the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and that it would benefit those who have not been charged but who remain in Northern Ireland. It is, in fact, a get-out-of-jail card for anybody who before 10 April 1998 committed an offence that was related to terrorism and the affairs of Northern Ireland, not just for those who have fled the country.</p><h4>12.30 pm</h4><p align=left>In closing, may I say that offences of the kind that have been committed in Northern Ireland are so serious that the House should be very careful before it lends its hand to such a Bill? It would find itself in the most absurd position if it attempted to achieve an equivalence between those who are terrorists&#151;who sought to destroy our society&#151;and those in Northern Ireland who attempted to defend society, but made an error of judgment. The new clause, by providing a distinction between the two in separate provisions, would further distance the security forces from those who are the terrorists&#146; representatives. I urge the Committee to accept it.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): I must ask the Minister to reflect on the fact that we have spent an hour and a half on this first small group of amendments. I urge him to recognise that while we on the Opposition Benches may have disagreements&#151;indeed, considerable disagreements with the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)&#151;our real disagreement is with the Bill. These proposals force us to reflect on which criminal offences, often involving murder, will be given a certificate, or the so-called get-out-of-jail-free card, and which will not. As a new Member of the House, I find it offensive to have to make such a judgment in my first Standing Committee.</p><p align=left>I ask the Minister for clarification of a point in new clause 2 and its implications. The Opposition have debated whether this measure should apply to members of the security forces who colluded with terrorist organisations. Will the Bill allow a certificate to be granted to members of the security forces who colluded with members of paramilitary or terrorist organisations? If so, is not that utterly insulting to members of the security forces who joined precisely because they want to uphold the law? Not only that&#151;they are prepared to risk their lives in doing so.</p><p align=left> That is why the Superintendents Association and members of the security forces are the strongest opponents of giving certificates to people who join the security forces and breach that fundamental tenet of what the security forces are all about. On the other hand&#151;this is the absurdity of it&#151;if the Bill will not offer certificates to members of the security forces who have colluded with paramilitaries, can the Minister explain why he is prepared to give certificates to the people who committed terrorist acts, but not to those members of the security forces who may have colluded with them?</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 36</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> As the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) pointed out, this has been a very full debate on a range of issues, and I recognise the strength of feeling surrounding the context of the legislation. One does not have to be a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office, as I have been since May, to know of the great concern over aspects of the Bill. I fully recognise the legitimacy of hon. Members from both sides of the Committee who oppose the Bill and the strength of feeling that they brought to their opposition on Second Reading. However, the legislation received a Second Reading by a majority of 48 and is now in Committee.</p><p align=left>The purpose of consideration in Committee is to explore the issues in preparation for consideration on Report and Third Reading, and for an interesting passage through the House of Lords. I recognise the frustration that the hon. Member for South-West Surrey feels about his first Standing Committee sitting. I know that it exists, having served on far too many Committees and having spent five years in opposition, but that is the nature of the business we are in. During debates, I listen to what hon. Members have to say and explain the Government&#146;s position. As we progress, I shall reflect on what has been said in Committee so that we can consider such matters.</p><p align=left>The Government did not put this package together from ideas that were pulled from nowhere. We decided on it over time because we believe that it is in the long-term interests of peace in Northern Ireland. I accept that there is disagreement between members of the Committee, but the Government have felt strongly over time&#151;since 2001 and with the Weston Park and Hillsborough discussions, which my hon.
