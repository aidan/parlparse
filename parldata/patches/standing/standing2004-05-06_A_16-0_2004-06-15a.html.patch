 retirement age? Is it 65, 75 or even 80? We do not know. Therefore, given the uncertainties attached to the amendment and the correctness of the Government's approach, I ask Opposition Members not to press their amendments to a vote.
 <P>
 <B>Mr. George Osborne </B>(Tatton) (Con): The Financial Secretary has taken a leaf out of the Prime Minister's book and made a pre-emptive strike on our amendments, which attempt to tease out a debate about the valuation of people's pots in defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and about the ways in which they are treated differently. With your latitude, Sir John, perhaps we will have that debate in several forms this afternoon.<P>
-The Government like to believe that they are creating a single regime for pensions; indeed, the Financial Secretary said so at the beginning of our discussions on these clauses. PricewaterhouseCoopers says that in fact they are creating six regimes. I am doing a bit of triangulation—[Hon. Members<P>

 My basic point is that there are two regimes. Defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are treated very differently because of the way in which the pension pots and rights, whether crystallised or uncrystallised, are valued. We are having this debate now because the amendments have been selected for this clause, but they really apply to clauses 201 onwards.
 <P>
 A person who is in a defined benefit scheme and who is entitled to a pension of £75,000 a year from, for example, a final salary scheme, is deemed to have a pot worth £1.5 million. That is because of the 20 to 1 valuation factor that will be discussed later under clause 263. The official Opposition—I am always a bit nervous when I speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), but I am sure that I do so correctly on this occasion—believe that that factor is a good, simple way of valuing a pot. It is particularly generous if someone is 50, particularly mean if they are 70, but fair if they are 60.
