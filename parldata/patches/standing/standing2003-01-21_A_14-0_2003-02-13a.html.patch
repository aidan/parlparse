 The new approach to fire cover recommended by the Bain review is, of course, being considered. But again, any new approach would still necessitate local consultation, and any new guidance would make it clear that the current arrangements for consulting the public, fire service employees and the fire service inspectorate on the reallocation of resources should continue.

 <B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): What would happen if a fire authority failed to consult properly in the way set out in the guidance that the Government will produce?<P>
-<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The fire authority would be open to the very course of action that I have just described—judicial review—because it would be failing to act in the way that any reasonable fire authority should act. I hope that that would not happen. Certainly the fire service inspectorate would want to keep a good watch to ensure that proceedings followed in the way outlined.<P>

 <B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): Does my right hon. Friend agree that if the new clause is added to the Bill it will be wise to produce new guidance on consultation, bearing it in mind that some fire authorities will have viewed the fall-back process of a referral to the Secretary of State as effectively negating some part of their duty to take the consultation process seriously?<P>
 <B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. I can give him an absolute assurance that it is our intention to issue new guidance. We have reached an understanding with the FBU that there will be consultation with it and with the local authority employers through an ad hoc forum on a range of matters relating to the Bain proposals and other issues that are not being considered within the national joint council for determining pay and conditions. We intend to begin those consultations in the near future, and we will then make more widely available the proposed guidance that the fire inspectorate has prepared.<P>
 <B>Mr. Davey:</B> Just for the record, can the Minister confirm that the courts could take the guidance that the Government will issue into account in the judicial review of the case of a fire authority that allegedly not consulting properly?<p>

For the purposes of deciding how to fulfil that duty, a best value authority must consult, among others, representatives of persons who use, or are likely to use, its services. In addition to any guidance, there will be the clear presumption, which is embedded in the best value regime, that people who are likely to use the service must be consulted. Obviously, that means the local population that depends on the service.<P>

 New clause 13 and amendment No. 188 will remove the requirement for fire authorities to provide an annual return on their establishment schemes contained in section 19(3) of the 1947 Act, together with the Secretary of State's powers to make an establishment scheme under section 19(5) and to hold public local inquiries into the exercise of his functions under section 19(8). Fire authorities provide information on their establishments by a number of other means, and that provision is now unnecessary. The Secretary of State's powers to make an establishment scheme represent a degree of central control that no longer rests comfortably with a modern and flexible fire service that responds to locally identified needs and is accountable to the community that it serves.

 <B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very important and fair point. We certainly do not intend in any way to reduce the level of cover and the confidence that the public can have in the effectiveness of the fire service. However, he will understand that a modern assessment of need must take account of the threat to life and today's location of people at risk.<P>
 The problem with the old national standards is that they relate predominantly to property types. For example, if a fire occurs in an empty office block in a town centre in the middle of the night, it is necessary under the existing national standards for two fire appliances to reach the site within five minutes, and a third within eight minutes. However, if a fire occurs at the same time in a house in a suburban area that is occupied by a family whose lives are at risk, the current standard requires only one appliance to attend within eight to 10 minutes.

 It is therefore crucial that the guidance for consultations be robust, and that the local community should have confidence in it. I understand the logic behind this, but I am concerned about the robustness of any consultation requirements. We must get that right before the Bill receives Royal Assent.

 <B>Mr. Borrow:</B> My part of the country is a shire county. Therefore the fire authority covers the whole of the county, and is largely run by members of Lancashire county council, whereas the focus within the community tends to be the small district council. That is where local councillors and local community leaders get involved, and there was a feeling in South Ribble at that time that the district council and their representatives were not given a formal role in an adequate way. It is crucial for that sort of issue to be taken into account when the guidelines are drawn up by Ministers.<P>
