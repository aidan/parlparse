You may be interested to know that at a debate at the university of Oxford last Thursday on political correctness it was pointed out to me that the term chairman derives not from the &#147;chair&#148; and the male of our species, but from &#147;chair&#148; and the French for hand. Therefore, to be a Chairman is to have one&#146;s hand on the Chair.
