 <B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want to resist the aspersions cast by the hon. Gentleman as they are unhelpful. I say to him and to the whole Committee that there is a genuine problem. It has been clear on a number of occasions that Opposition Members have wanted additional time to carry out a thorough scrutiny of the Bill. That has been repeatedly offered and resisted. With the best of intentions, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East thought that it would be helpful&#151;we discussed this&#151;if we were to get ahead of the knives with a discussion this evening of the clauses from clause 115 onwards. That was certainly not done with any intention to restrict hon. Members' ability to make points in the debate or to table additional amendments. Some amendments to clause 121 have already been tabled by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough.<P>

 <B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I will not. We have absolutely no intention of restricting debate, quite the opposite. We want to ensure that members of the Committee have the time that they clearly want to consider these matters fully and carefully. That is the intention behind the proposals that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East has made. My hon. Friend wants to make a further suggestion, given the concerns now being expressed. It is very important to make it clear on the record that the motivation behind these proposals is to give additional time. There has been frustration on our part that those offers have been resisted up until now. My hon. Friend has made a helpful suggestion, and I think he will want to make a further point on it in a moment.<P>
