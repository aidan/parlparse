 I am interested to know how Ofcom would regard its role, if that were to extend into an area that most people would not regard as traditional for the regulation of broadcast media. The rapid development of technology in radio raises many interesting questions. I wanted, therefore, to take this opportunity at the beginning of the debate on this set of clauses to raise some of those questions and ask the Minister to respond.

 <B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made the point fairly that this is the start of the debate on radio. On that basis, I am prepared to allow a fairly wide-ranging debate on the first clause in this set of clauses, should hon. Members wish to take advantage of that.<P>
-I would like to place on the record and make it plain, in view of the ribaldry coming from the Government Back Benches, that my offshore broadcasting career took place prior to the passage of the Marine, &c, Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967, that it was entirely legal, and that it was in the finest spirit of free enterprise.

 You and I were involved in independent local radio, Mr. Gale, and we both recall the old Independent <p>
