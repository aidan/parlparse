 Many BID proposals will involve small businesses with very limited resources, time and personnel for calculating what they are likely to have to pay.

 <B>Mr. Davey:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?<P>
 <B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> No. I have been asked by the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall) to give way, and I shall happily do so. We need from the Government an idea of how the information is to be disseminated. If matters get to the point of a ballot, it is surely in everyone's interest that it should succeed.<P>
-<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument about the immense complication and difficulty for business partners in a BID scheme of working out what they will have to pay. The scheme will have to specify in advance that it will apply a figure of 1 per cent. or 5 per cent., for example, of the business rate bill. All that businesses will have to do is apply that simple percentage to what they pay. Surely they are capable of that?<P>

 <B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I suspect that the hon. Member for Bedford and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will try the same tack, which shows that they do not know how the system works. I assure hon. Members that they will find out, on reading some of the formulas that we shall discuss in a little while, how difficult it is in the non-domestic rates system to calculate the actual amount payable, which is what businesses will be interested in. They might want to ask themselves, after studying those formulas, how easy it would be for them to work out, given the multiplier, the amount payable. It will be interesting to hear what they have to say.<P>
 <B>The Chairman:</B> I remind hon. Members that although we are debating new clause 6 it will be moved and, if necessary, voted on only at the appropriate point later on.<P>
 <B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke of the need for financial certainty to generate enthusiasm for the BID, and the Under-Secretary readily agreed. Therefore, when we come to that part of our proceedings, I fully expect him to say that he will accept new clause 6, because it self-evidently supports the sentiments that he has agreed to.<P>
