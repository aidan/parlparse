 Let us briefly consider the history. For a time, it appeared that the regulator, Oftel, now to be replaced, was trying to encourage the alternative infrastructure. Although it recognised the potential of local loop unbundling, it even talked about building separate buildings next to existing BT exchanges. It concluded that for the time being direct competition to the BT access network would adversely affect the development of competition and would not be in the interests of the UK consumer.
 <P>
 A development in Oftel's thinking took place when the current director general, David Edmonds, took up his position. He suggested that trying to encourage infrastructure competition was unlikely to provide the immediate boost to competition that was desirable, and therefore gave a higher priority to achieving local loop unbundling. His main reasons for reopening that issue were that the European Union had already identified it as a priority and that it would be a way of achieving the rapid expansion of new technologies. In 1999, he announced that BT should be required to permit access to its local loops. A target was then set whereby such access should be achieved by July 2001.

 Figures produced by the European Competitive Telecommunications Association, which is the telecommunications trade body, reveal that less than 0.01 per cent. of European local loop lines have been unbundled to new entrants. On the scale of the achievement in Britain, whereas the Government had set a target of widespread unbundling, earlier this year out of 29 million lines in the hands of BT some 164 had been unbundled. The figure is a little higher now, but 164 out of 29 million gives hon. Members a good picture of the progress that we have made. That compares with 623,000 unbundled lines in Germany, where unbundling started in 1998, and 40,000 in Denmark. The ECTA also noted that France and Spain have barely got off their starting blocks. The figure in France was 400 and in Spain it was 10.

 <B>Mr. Allan</b>:</B> The hon. Gentleman tempts me into a broad area. In respect of encouraging investment in broadband services, there is a potentially strong market for some of the services touched on already, especially entertainment-related content, which has already been identified as an important area. There is also a range of functionality in areas such as open source software, which generate a great amount of interest in accessing broadband services. If one wants to download operating systems and applications from the internet, as is increasingly becoming possible, a current dial-up connection will not work very effectively. We are on the brink of a huge explosion in interest. It is a little like the chicken and the egg—which comes first, the exciting content or the access? We need both together. I have no doubt that the functionality that people can achieve through a broadband connection will drive up interest dramatically in the near future.<P>
 Clause 69 is where the access-related conditions will be critical. People may want to build on the infrastructure, or may feel that the only way to develop services is to create an entirely new infrastructure. That would be wasteful in terms of national resource and will also hold back development, as was the case with local loop unbundling.

The phone will actually come up with four networks, but only in this country can people not access anything other than their own network. If people are in any other country and do the same thing, they can choose which network to use. One will generally be cheaper than the others, because there will be some arrangement between the companies. The technology is clearly there, as the phone identifies it. We would move towards a more competitive market if we could have an arrangement whereby we had the same ability in this country that we do abroad.<P>

 I understand that no other organisation has any similar power, allowing it to overrule Ofcom simply because it has determined that what Ofcom is proposing may create a barrier to the single market. That suggests that Ofcom proposals to regularise the market in the UK may lead to difficulties depending on the European Commission's view on the market for a particular telecommunications service throughout Europe as a whole. As far as I can see from clause 78—perhaps the Minister will confirm this—there is no right of appeal against the European Commission's decision. Would the Commission's decision be subject to judicial review?

 If the answer to that question is none—as I hope it will be—my question is what arrangements are in place to make sure that an old boys' club in which information is quietly exchanged does not come into existence. There are a number of ways to deal with companies with significant market power. I am thinking of the way in which the German regulator has had a cosy relationship with Deutsche Telekom in the roll-out of broadband in order to promote broadband. That is contrary to the spirit of competition, which the European Union has been pushing. This country has a particular interaction with the Republic of Ireland, and clause 79 talks about definitions of the market.

 In any case, where Ofcom intends to identify a particular market or make a market power determination, during the period given for representations under clause 76 the European Commission may inform Ofcom that it believes that the proposed market identified in the notice or Ofcom's proposed market determination may not be compatible with the single European market or with any Community obligations. In that case, Ofcom must not give effect to its proposals for a further two months. Ofcom must withdraw its proposal if, in accordance with the procedure in article 7(4), the Commission decides within that two-month period that the proposal must be withdrawn.

 If we are to have a single international market, there inevitably needs to be the possibility of such an intervention taking place. Of course, as the hon.

I can give him the assurance that he was looking for because there is a firm commitment, which was reaffirmed at the European Council meeting in Brussels only a week or so ago, that every member state is committed to implementing the new telecommunications framework before 25 July. He can be confident that if there are any problems in that process there will be a good deal of pressure and sanction. There is a genuine European Union-wide commitment to implementing the directives, including that particular element of them. There is no getting away from the requirement in article 7(4) of the framework directive, which is very clear.

 Question proposed,{**roman**} That the clause stand part of the Bill.
 <P>
 <B>Mr. Lansley</b>:</B> I did not want to speak to the amendment because the Government accepted what the scrutiny Committee said about the mandatory character of periodic market analyses. I will not dwell on the subject that we previously discussed relating to the withdrawal of obligations. However, it is perfectly clear, not least from what the Minister has just said, that clauses 80 and 81 relate to the review of market analyses, rather than to the original market analyses. Perhaps the Minister will get back to me if there is some reassurance he can give about the nature of the withdrawal of pre-existing obligations.<P>
-I have a question for the Minister. Clause 80(4) will revoke SMP conditions if a subsequent analysis discloses that there is no one with significant market power in relation to the market analysed. The clause and the market analysis relate not only to SMP conditions but, under the Community directives, to conditions under article 7 of the access directive and article 16 of the universal service directive. Perhaps I have missed it somewhere else, but I wanted to be sure that, in so far as a review identifies that a market is effectively competitive, it is not only the case that SMP conditions are withdrawn, but that, where appropriate, access-related and universal service obligations related to whether a market is competitive are also revoked or withdrawn by the mechanism set out in the clause.<p>

-<B>Mr. Whittingdale</b>:</B> Clause 83 is obviously especially important, as it specifies the ability of Ofcom to set conditions when it has identified a provider of communication services as having significant market power. In terms of the conditions that may be imposed on that dominant provider, one of the key obligations is likely to be non-discrimination. By that, I mean a requirement that will prevent the dominant provider <!35>from discriminating in favour of the dominant supplier's own downstream businesses, as opposed to supplies of the same services by third party competitors.<P>

 I hesitate to name BT again, but it is the obvious example. It supplies services in competition with other providers on its own network. Obviously, BT's competitors could be placed at a significant disadvantage if the incumbent—in other words, BT—were able to reduce the quality of service, or charge higher prices.
 <P>
 Under the current BT licence, which is to be replaced by the new regime established through the Bill, BT is required not to show undue discrimination or undue preference to itself. However, it is not a requirement of the access and interconnection directive that discrimination must be undue for there to be a breach of the non-discrimination obligation. I refer the Minister to paragraph 17 of the article's preamble and article 10 of the directive, in which there is no reference to a materiality threshold—in other words, the degree of discrimination necessary for the measure to come into effect.

I hope that the Minister can respond on an issue that Ofcom will face that has not been dealt with well enough in the case of the Oftel regime—the matter of billing by BT's incoming supplier. It is perfectly possible to purchase all one's telephone services from a third-party supplier, but the line still has to be rented from BT.<P>
 BT has no duty to pass on billing information to the third-party supplier, so one receives only a single bill from the third-party supplier, and with that, all the promotional material—the most important bit—for the third-party supplier services. One is left receiving both the billing from BT, and so its presence in the home, and, importantly, all its promotional material. It is clear that BT will have to face such issues. The concern must be whether we are leaving a gap that allows the incumbent supplier to say that that faces due discrimination. There is an argument that the incumbent supplier will have to change its accounting systems and that that will be expensive. One has to respond to that and to allow a certain amount of leeway. However, the interposition of the word ''unduly'' creates a position whereby a third party can prove that there is a problem with a competitive market and that a supplier is discriminating in favour of itself. In future it may not be BT, but another company seeking to defend its position and to impose barriers to a truly competitive market. Under the current terms, it may argue that that is not undue discrimination because it is a small infringement and it would be expensive to change it.
 <P>
 There is a balance between the extent to which the infringement of the competitive market takes place and the way in which that judgment is made. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford helpfully pointed us to the European Union law framework, which is a fairly basic one that says that we must promote competitive markets and we cannot say that a practice is only slightly anti-competitive and is therefore okay. As making those judgments between the potential cost imposed and the infringement will turn on the definitions in the Bill, I hope that the Minister can clarify his understanding of the way in which it will operate in the context of the real world decisions that regulators face and will face in future.

-<B>Mr. Timms</b>:</B> I hope that I can reassure members of the Committee about what these words will be taken to mean. In a way, this returns to our earlier discussion about words being used in UK law that are familiar in UK law. In this case, the term ''undue discrimination'' is well established and well understood in UK law and will not support the lax interpretation about which the hon. Members for Maldon and East Chelmsford and for Sheffield, Hallam rightly expressed concern. The law recognises that some kinds of discrimination are entirely proper and necessary. Businesses routinely offer different terms in different circumstances, and if those differences in terms are based on objective differences—for example, a discount for a big order—that is not a problem. It would be construed as discrimination, but it is not undue discrimination, and there is no problem with it. It is only where equivalent proposals or customers in equivalent circumstances are treated differently that the question of undue or improper discrimination arises. The term ''undue <!37>discrimination'' does the job that the directive requires, and the Bill as it stands will give effect to article 10(2) of the access directive without the amendment being made.<P>

 The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam made an interesting point and gave a good example. Companies such as Centrica, with its One.Tel service, have complained for a long time that its customers get two bills while BT's customers get a single bill. Oftel recently made a determination on that so that it will be possible in future for One.Tel's customers to receive one bill instead of two, although there is some concern about how long that process will take. That is a good example of the kind of difficulty that arises, and which we certainly want the Bill to address. The form of words in the Bill does the job that is required.
 <P>
 <B>Mr. Whittingdale</b>:</B> I accept the Minister's assurance that the word ''undue'' is well established in English law and that the fear that it might create a certain amount of discrimination below a threshold is unjustified. These are not concerns that we have dreamed up</b>: they have been expressed by competitors in the market. I hope that they will gain some reassurance from the Minister's words. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>

 Furthermore, although Ofcom has the power to ask for information from, say, BT, that process relies on Ofcom asking BT the right questions. If we go on to place the burden of proof squarely on the dominant operator—say, BT—that will ensure that the operator is required to provide correct and full information, notwithstanding any misunderstanding by Ofcom as to which costs are involved; that is, notwithstanding Ofcom's asking the wrong question in the first place.

-<B>Mr. Timms</b>:</B> The amendment is unnecessary. Subsection (10) gives Ofcom powers to include appropriate obligations where access price controls are imposed.

 Ofcom should exercise its powers consistently with the directive, on the basis provided in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is right about what the directive says, and I am confident that Ofcom will perform its duties. If anyone affected by regulatory conditions concludes that Ofcom has not correctly implemented a requirement, they will have a full right of appeal. If the Government take the view that any international obligation has been incorrectly implemented, they will be able to direct Ofcom under clause 5.
 <P>
 I think that the concerns that the hon. Gentleman rightly raises are addressed by the Bill as it stands.
