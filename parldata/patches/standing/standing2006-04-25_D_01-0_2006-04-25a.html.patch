It is perhaps a sad reality of devolution that no ScottishMembers of Parliament are members of the Committee, so it is a joy thattwo Scottish MPs will be in the Chair using their wisdom to look afterus. We are all looking forward to that and to our forthcomingproceedings in which the various stars of the debate on Second Readingwill be brought together.

In light of the Minister&#146;sreference to both Chairmen being Scots, I am sure that we shall havecomplete impartiality from the Chair&#151;even more than we wouldhave done&#151;as the Bill is solely to do with commons in Englandand Wales. The hon. Gentleman referred to the stars of the debate onSecond Reading. It was not the longest debate in the history of debatesin the House of Commons; nevertheless the Bill involves many issues.Although it will not grab partisan headlines, a lot of matters willaffect many ordinary people, farmers and others throughout thecountry.</div><a name="06042581000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I confessthat, during my preparation for the Bill, I was surprised how manydifferent issues arose.

I am sure that we are lookingforward to his constructive responses. Several wrinkles need to beironed out. Questions need to be asked and, in some cases, changes needto be made despite the excellent work of the House of Lords in itsconsideration of the Bill. However, unusually, it did not get the Billentirely right so I am happy to support the programmemotion.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div><a name="06042581000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042581000390"></a><b class="B">Mr.Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): I alsowelcome you to our proceedings, Miss Begg, and look forward to servingunder your chairmanship.As the hon. Member for South-EastCambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) said, when preparing for our proceedings inCommittee we received several representations and a number of issuesmust be teased out. We might not have the opportunity for another 40years to deal with common land. It is therefore our duty to give theBill full scrutiny and attention so that we can put it in a form thatwill serve the interests of not only landowners and rights holders, butthe public who regard commons as an important national resource fortheir recreation, nature conservation and other conservation issues. Asalways, I look forward to the Minister&#146;s constructivecontributions to the debates and his responses to our amendments.

The clause says, &#147;Regulationsmay&#148;. Throughout the Bill, there are many issues relating tocommons that would be subject to regulation. The Minister said jokinglyon one occasion that there will be enough statutory instruments inrelation to the Bill to see us through our parliamentary careers.Looking around the room, in terms of longevity, perhaps my hon. Friendthe Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) has more chance of seeinganother Bill relating to commons than most of us. That being the case,we are concerned that the form of the regulation is not obviouslyclear.</div><a name="06042581000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any regulationthat allows information to be put on a register raises data protectionand human rights issues. We are concerned about the nature of theinformation that may be put on the register. I understand that theDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Bill team, in itsguidance document on identifying the ownership of rights of common,said that if not only the dominant tenement was included, but therights pertaining to it and the holder of those rights, that might leadto confusion about who holds the rights, because they refer to thedominant tenement, not a person. The only way to establish who owns thedominant tenement is to refer to the land register. If there were to bea problem in resolving an entry in the commons register and an entry inthe Land Registry, there might be some difficulty in agreeing who wasthe holder of therights.</div><a name="06042581000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having saidthat, I have already had my hand slapped by Mrs. Griffiths, the commonsregistration officer for Powys county council, who says that thecommons registry officers for Powys and the Marches insist that theclause is included in the Bill, and she tells me that she has puttremendous effort and activity into ensuring that that takes place. Herargument for doing so is that it has been helpful to farmers whoexercise rights of common, when claiming subsidies through theintegrated administration and control scheme, and now through thesingle farm payment, because they have been able to prove that theyhave rights overthe common by getting copies of the registerin which Mrs. Griffiths has included the individuals who own therights.</div><a name="06042581000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understandthat Powys county council has been reprimanded by DEFRA for taking thiscourse of action, so we are in quite a difficult position. I shall readbriefly a letter from Mrs.Griffiths:</div><a name="06042581000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently,the Rights section of the register shows the name of the originalapplicant for registration (1967-70) against the details of grazing fora particular farm holding. If a farm with grazing rights is sold inlots then application can be made to apportion the grazing rightsbetween the various parties on a pro rata basis according to acreage.We then amend the register and cross out the original 1960s entry andinsert two or more new entries.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="06042581000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">If the farm is transferred, as awhole, to the next generation on the death of the original applicant oris sold in its entirety to a new owner, there is no requirement underthe 1965 Act to amend the register. It is legally correct to show thename of a person who died or moved away 30-plus years ago and this isone of the reasons why the register needsupdating.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shegives an example from the area that she administers of the importanceof entering the names of rightsholders:</div><a name="06042581000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When...Llanbedrand Llandeilo hill (Ireland moor) went into the ESA, Maureen Lloyd, thecommoners&#146; association secretary, had to ensure that theregister was amended to show all the current commoners&#146; nameswere in the register or else they wouldn&#146;t receive payments foragreeing to reduce the number of animals grazing on thecommon.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is itthe Minister&#146;s intention that as a result of clause 3, commonsregistration authorities will include the names of the holders ofcommon rights? If so, that goes against the advice of the Bill team,which is a problem. We are concerned that the register, a publicdocument, might contain unnecessary information or information thatrights holders do not want to be there.</div><a name="06042581000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5) says thatregulations may</div> <a name="06042581000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requireor permit other information to be included in aregister&#148;.</div><a name="06042581000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not havea problem with &#147;permit&#148;, but we do with&#147;require&#148;. The provision is so open-ended that it wouldallow the publication of lots of quiteimproper andunnecessary information&#151;perhaps even information that goesagainst the nature of the legislation. Will the Minister respondpositively, indicating how he envisages that the regulation will actand what will be init?</div><a name="06042581000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000395"></a>JimKnight:</b> I would be pleased if the hon. Gentleman passed onmy best wishes to Mrs. Griffiths of Powys council, who clearly showswisdom. We will return to the registration of ownership of rights whenwe discuss clause 8 and the interesting issue of apportionment, so Ishall not dwell on it unduly.</div><a name="06042581000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The register&#146;s coreelements are the land register and the rights register. The landregister contains a conclusive record of the extent of common land andgreens, and the rights register contains a conclusive record of thenature and quantification of rights exercisable over the land to whichthey are attached.</div><a name="06042581000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power in subsection (5) isintended to amplify what can or must be shown in the register. Forexample, we expect to provide that the registers may continue to showall the additional information&#151;information about mineral rightsand public rights of access, for example&#151;that the 1965 Actpermitted them to show. That the register should continue to show thatinformation does not raise any new data registration or human rightsissues.</div><a name="06042581000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have alsoproposed that commoners should be able to enter in the register adeclaration of their entitlement to exercise rights of common when theyown the land to which such rights are attached. I think that thatanswers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question&#151;they would be ableto register those rights, but would not necessarily have to. We willreturn to that when we discuss apportionment. It is not realistic torequire people to register those rights, because in the real world itwould be difficult to make them do so. The <div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>measures will improve the availability of information about who isentitled to exercise the rights over a particular common. The provisionof such information will be for assistance only, as the informationwill not beconclusive.</div><a name="06042581000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theregulation-making power in subsection (5) is an essential tool forobtaining the information that must be shown in registers undersubsections (1) to (4). The Government will consult on draft proposalsfor regulations under subsection (5), so some of these issues, whichthe hon. Gentleman has rightly raised, will be subject to debate underthose order-making powers and as those orders go through. However, wewill consult, as part of our commitment to consult, on the detailedimplementation of part 1 generally.</div><a name="06042581000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45am</div><a name="06042581000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect ofthe hon. Gentleman&#146;s question as to why we should&#147;require&#148; rather than &#147;permit&#148;, it must bepossible for regulations to require certain additional information tobe included in the register, rather than leave it to theauthorities&#146; discretion, for example, declarations ofentitlements to rights to which I have just referred.

The clause says, &#147;Regulationsmay&#148;. Throughout the Bill, there are many issues relating tocommons that would be subject to regulation. The Minister said jokinglyon one occasion that there will be enough statutory instruments inrelation to the Bill to see us through our parliamentary careers.Looking around the room, in terms of longevity, perhaps my hon. Friendthe Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) has more chance of seeinganother Bill relating to commons than most of us. That being the case,we are concerned that the form of the regulation is not obviouslyclear.</div><a name="06042581000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any regulationthat allows information to be put on a register raises data protectionand human rights issues. We are concerned about the nature of theinformation that may be put on the register. I understand that theDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Bill team, in itsguidance document on identifying the ownership of rights of common,said that if not only the dominant tenement was included, but therights pertaining to it and the holder of those rights, that might leadto confusion about who holds the rights, because they refer to thedominant tenement, not a person. The only way to establish who owns thedominant tenement is to refer to the land register. If there were to bea problem in resolving an entry in the commons register and an entry inthe Land Registry, there might be some difficulty in agreeing who wasthe holder of therights.</div><a name="06042581000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having saidthat, I have already had my hand slapped by Mrs. Griffiths, the commonsregistration officer for Powys county council, who says that thecommons registry officers for Powys and the Marches insist that theclause is included in the Bill, and she tells me that she has puttremendous effort and activity into ensuring that that takes place. Herargument for doing so is that it has been helpful to farmers whoexercise rights of common, when claiming subsidies through theintegrated administration and control scheme, and now through thesingle farm payment, because they have been able to prove that theyhave rights overthe common by getting copies of the registerin which Mrs. Griffiths has included the individuals who own therights.</div><a name="06042581000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understandthat Powys county council has been reprimanded by DEFRA for taking thiscourse of action, so we are in quite a difficult position. I shall readbriefly a letter from Mrs.Griffiths:</div><a name="06042581000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently,the Rights section of the register shows the name of the originalapplicant for registration (1967-70) against the details of grazing fora particular farm holding. If a farm with grazing rights is sold inlots then application can be made to apportion the grazing rightsbetween the various parties on a pro rata basis according to acreage.We then amend the register and cross out the original 1960s entry andinsert two or more new entries.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="06042581000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">If the farm is transferred, as awhole, to the next generation on the death of the original applicant oris sold in its entirety to a new owner, there is no requirement underthe 1965 Act to amend the register. It is legally correct to show thename of a person who died or moved away 30-plus years ago and this isone of the reasons why the register needsupdating.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shegives an example from the area that she administers of the importanceof entering the names of rightsholders:</div><a name="06042581000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When...Llanbedrand Llandeilo hill (Ireland moor) went into the ESA, Maureen Lloyd, thecommoners&#146; association secretary, had to ensure that theregister was amended to show all the current commoners&#146; nameswere in the register or else they wouldn&#146;t receive payments foragreeing to reduce the number of animals grazing on thecommon.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is itthe Minister&#146;s intention that as a result of clause 3, commonsregistration authorities will include the names of the holders ofcommon rights? If so, that goes against the advice of the Bill team,which is a problem. We are concerned that the register, a publicdocument, might contain unnecessary information or information thatrights holders do not want to be there.</div><a name="06042581000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5) says thatregulations may</div> <a name="06042581000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requireor permit other information to be included in aregister&#148;.</div><a name="06042581000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not havea problem with &#147;permit&#148;, but we do with&#147;require&#148;. The provision is so open-ended that it wouldallow the publication of lots of quiteimproper andunnecessary information&#151;perhaps even information that goesagainst the nature of the legislation.

The landregister contains a conclusive record of the extent of common land andgreens, and the rights register contains a conclusive record of thenature and quantification of rights exercisable over the land to whichthey are attached.</div><a name="06042581000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power in subsection (5) isintended to amplify what can or must be shown in the register. Forexample, we expect to provide that the registers may continue to showall the additional information&#151;information about mineral rightsand public rights of access, for example&#151;that the 1965 Actpermitted them to show. That the register should continue to show thatinformation does not raise any new data registration or human rightsissues.</div><a name="06042581000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have alsoproposed that commoners should be able to enter in the register adeclaration of their entitlement to exercise rights of common when theyown the land to which such rights are attached. I think that thatanswers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question&#151;they would be ableto register those rights, but would not necessarily have to. We willreturn to that when we discuss apportionment. It is not realistic torequire people to register those rights, because in the real world itwould be difficult to make them do so. The <div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>measures will improve the availability of information about who isentitled to exercise the rights over a particular common. The provisionof such information will be for assistance only, as the informationwill not beconclusive.</div><a name="06042581000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theregulation-making power in subsection (5) is an essential tool forobtaining the information that must be shown in registers undersubsections (1) to (4). The Government will consult on draft proposalsfor regulations under subsection (5), so some of these issues, whichthe hon. Gentleman has rightly raised, will be subject to debate underthose order-making powers and as those orders go through.

I, in my quick year as a Member of the House, have seena number of powers passed on to local authorities in all sorts ofareas.

Those with more specialism could offer tosupport those that have less. Presumably, there would need to be someagreement on resources on that, should that be a problem. It wouldensure that landowners and people who have rights over common land, inwhichever authority the commons are based, would be able to haverecourse to specialist officers with the time and resources to resolveany issues that may need to be resolved.

Members made the pointthat they were pleased that the duties of the commons registrationauthority would remain with local government, and I support that. Partof the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that if a power is givento a local authority to use another organisation to carry out itsfunctions as a commons registration authority, that organisation wouldbe another commons registration authority, not an agency.</div><a name="06042581000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">To help the Minister a littlebit, I can say that such informal arrangements are already carried outin Wales. The Swansea unitary authority and the Neath Port Talbotunitary authority share a commons registration officer. The Blackmountains in Powys are a series of contiguous commons for which thePowys commons registration officer also holds the registerforthe Herefordshire part. It is a transnational arrangement, not just across-authority arrangement.</div><a name="06042581000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such arrangements happen inpractice.

One thing that worries meis that the notes on clauses make no reference to turbary. I did notsay that to raise a laugh in Committee. It is an important right forpeople in my area. They still dig peat and use it for domesticpurposes.

Thelocal authority, acting as the commons registration authority, willperform its duties in a quasi-judicial form, much as it does in <div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>respect of planning. From my experience of chairing a planning committeeon a local authority, I recall that issues were often controversialwith views held strongly on both sides. I have no reason to doubt thatthat was anything but thenorm.</div><a name="06042581000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Localauthorities are in a good position to perform such duties as long asthey are performed subject to advice. In the same way, when theyperform their duties as a planning authority, they carry out thosefunctions with advice.

Paragraph 50 of the explanatory notescontains an example of a common <div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>that is subject to rights to graze 100 sheep and that is divided equallybetween two farms A and B.

It goes on tosay:</div><a name="06042581000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Farm B issold to a developer who in turn sells it off in 50 plots, each with ahouse built on it.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Underthe rules and regulations, the owners of each of those houses</div><a name="06042581000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be able to show that theyoccupy 1/50<span class="Sup">th</span> part of the area of the historic dominanttenement B, and (applying the rules of pro rata apportionment)therefore each has attached to it 1/50<span class="Sup">th</span> of the rightsrecorded as attached to historic dominant tenementB&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06042581000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">namely, onesheep.</div><a name="06042581000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sort ofthing undermines the integrity of the commons and the credibility ofthe system. As I understand it, that is what must happen under the Billas it is drafted. There is no alternative, as somebody once said. Theexample prompts some detailed questions. Obviously, not all thosehouses will occupy exactly one fiftieth of the original area. We mightget into serious fractions of sheep, because some houses occupyslightly more square metres than others, but I set that pointaside.</div><a name="06042581000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although such asituation could happen in many different scenarios, I raise an ideasimply to get the Minister&#146;s response: there should be a systemwhereby the developer who bought plot B ought to be able under certaincircumstances to sever the rights from all the modern houses and giveor sell them back to the association, or make them available for otherrights owners to acquire. That would keep those rights in the hands ofpeople who seriously want them rather than in the hands of those peoplewho buy houses and end up with the right to one sheep.</div><a name="06042581000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that, in somecircumstances, development might mean that house owners would end upwith a number of rights that would have a value. I am not suggestingthat anything should be compulsory, but the developer should have anopportunity to sever the rights. As long as the rights remain on thecommon and must go to a rights holder with a dominant tenement of thecommon, all the principles that the Bill is trying toespouse&#151;principles with cross-Committee and cross-Housesupport&#151;will be retained without leading to the somewhatludicrous and extreme outlined in the explanatory notes, whichnevertheless can and, indeed, does happen.

For example, that may occur when the owner sells only partof his farm holding and retains the remainder. Traditionally, where aland holding is divided between separate new owners, the rights ofcommon attached to that land must be divided between the new owners inproportion to their share of the land, as we have heard in relation tosheep.</div><a name="06042581000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to thehon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that there is an alternative.It is set out in clause 11, which, as we will perhaps discuss, enablesa right of common attached to a dominant tenement to be concentrated onpart of the dominant tenement, where another part is to be developedfor non-agricultural use. I hope that that satisfieshim.</div><a name="06042581000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8 providesthat regulations may enable the registration of apportionment, butsubsection (2) implies, as is our intention, that regulations will notrequire apportionment to be registered, as we discussed in respect ofan earlierclause.</div><a name="06042581000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somestakeholders have asked why we do not ensure the mandatory registrationof apportionment. The answer is a little complex, but to summarise:first, we do not think it possible to require apportionment to beregistered, because there is no sensible sanction that could be appliedin default, nor any likelihood of its enforcement; and secondly, thecommons registers will not show who owns and occupies the land to whicha right is attached. There is little point seeking to registerapportionment, because there will be nothing to change in the registerin consequence of it. The reality is as the hon. Member for Brecon andRadnorshire described it during the debate on clause 3 in respect ofthe Land Registry. We have undertaken to explore whether regulationsunder clause 4 can enable commoners to make a declaration ofentitlement to exercise rights of common that would be includedin the register as additionalinformation.</div><a name="06042581000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000415"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, but Iam going to challenge him, because I am not entirely convinced thatclause 11, to which he has drawn my attention, addresses the issue thatI raised and that is raised in paragraph 50 of the explanatory notesthat describes the scenario of the whole dominant tenement beingdeveloped. Although I am happy to be proved wrong&#151;I am notconvinced that I am&#151;clause 11 refers to the &#147;relevantpart&#148; being developed.

Our expectation isthat that would be done in the public interest and attached to thecommon.</div><a name="06042581000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Questionput and agreedto.</i></div><a name="06042581000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question 10ordered to stand part of theBill.</i></div><a name="06042581000030"></a><h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause11</h4><a name="06042581000015"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Re-allocationof attachedrights</div><a name="06042581000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Questionproposed</i>, That the clause stand part of theBill.</div><a name="06042581000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000423"></a>JimKnight:</b> The clause enables a right of common attached to adominant tenement to be concentrated on part of the dominant tenement,as we discussed in respect of clause 9.

When I was Environment Ministerin the 1990s, we looked into commons law, and I was advised by theFederation of Cumbria Commoners that it was important that it be tidiedup. Then I listened to the wise advice of my officials in theDepartment, who said, &#147;For God&#146;s sake, Minister,don&#146;t touch this with a bargepole; it&#146;s anightmare.&#148; So I congratulate the Minister on having the courageto tidy up the law; we support what he is doing. I also congratulatehis officials, who, I believe, have been to Cumbria on a couple ofoccasions to meet the Federation of Cumbria Commoners. Cumbria&#146;sfederation is one of the largest in the country, and Cumbria has one ofthe largest patches&#151;or lots of patches&#151;of common land inthe country.</div> <a name="06042581000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">AlthoughI have been briefed by that organisation, I apologise to the Ministerif I do not do justice to the complicated brief that I have beenseeking to understand. I wish to raise points about the regulationsthat may be made under the clause. The Government have stated that thepurpose of the Bill is to provide accurate and up-to-date commonsregisters to underpin commons management, through a duty on localauthorities to update and maintain the registers of common land, and toprovide that future transactions have no legal effect unless they areregistered. The problem is that the Bill does not do that completely;it is only 95 per cent. there.</div><a name="06042581000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will be conclusive onwhat land rights attach to, and on the ownership of those rights ingross. But the register will not be updated or maintained to show whoowns the vast majority of rights&#151;those that are attached. TheGovernment acknowledge that, and they rightly comment that it is notpossible for both the Land Registry and the commons register to beconclusive about the ownership of the dominant tenant. The federationagrees, but does not see a problem with requiring all transfers to benotified to the commons registration authorities. The registers havenever given proof of ownership, but if they are not kept up to date,they are useless for management purposes when commoners need to belocated. Also, significant costs will accrue to the Government andcommoners in cases in which identifying and communicating withcommoners is essential&#151;for example, in respect of applicationsto establish statutory commons associations, applications for <div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>environmental stewardship schemes, applications to undertake works oncommons and compulsory purchaseprocedures.</div><a name="06042581000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">In theother place, the Government argued that there can be only onedefinitive record of ownership. Otherwise, which would take priority ifthere were inconsistencies between the Land Registry and commonsregister entries? The reason is undoubtedly correct; even I understandand agree with it, and that is what the federation says, too. However,it also says that that should not prevent the making of a requirementthat transfers of rights be notified&#151;notified only&#151;to thelocal authority and perhaps be accompanied by a certificate from theLand Registry, or something like that. The commons registers would notbe proof of ownership, but they would have all that informationattached to them, so at least they would then be useful workingdocuments. Without such up-to-date records, otherschemes&#151;applications for commons associations and environmentalstewardship schemes&#151;would become very difficult to set up. Thatwas recognised in the otherplace.</div><a name="06042581000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want toconclude by pressing the Minister to state in this place what hiscolleague Lord Bach said in the other place when pressed on a similarissue. Hesaid:</div><a name="06042581000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I acceptthat we should try to make the commons registers as helpful as possibleto those who do not need conclusive proof of the matters but who wishto have some idea of entitlement. We therefore intend to explore, inconsultation on implementation of Part 1, whether regulations shouldprovide that a declaration of entitlement to exercise rights can beincluded in the registers. I must stress that such a declaration couldnot and would not be conclusive or binding on any person, but it may behelpful that such information can be entered on the register, with anappropriate caveat. We will also consult on whether other informationcould be noted on the registers at the discretion of the registrationauthority, such as Land Registry title numbers and the identity of theowner of the dominant tenement when the authority last sought thatinformation from the registeroftitle.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 25October 2005; Vol. 674, c.GC315-16.]</div><a name="06042581000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a weewhile since that debate in the other place when Lord Bach made thatcomment. I hope that the Minister will be able to say today that theGovernment&#146;s thinking has moved forward&#151;that theintention to consult has firmed up a bit, or that the Government havedone some preliminary consultation and come to a conclusion that thatis a route down which they wish togo.</div><a name="06042581000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want anassurance from the Minister that regulations will be made under thelegislation that enable dealings with the owner of the dominanttenement to be at least recorded on the commons register with asufficient sanction imposed for any failure to notify, so thatnotification becomes the standard conveyancing practice. When rightsare bought or sold and the Land Registry is informed, the registrationauthority should be automatically notified so that the commons registercan be similarly annotated or updated&#151;I probably should not say&#147;annotated&#148; as that probably has some technical legalconnotation. An assurance on that from the Minister would make us veryhappy, and the Cumbria Federation of Commoners would be delighted thatI may have got the point across halfsensibly.</div><a name="06042581000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000427"></a>Mr.Drew:</b> I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship,Miss Begg.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="06042581000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not intend to dwell on thissubject. However, the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border(David Maclean) referred to a debate in the other place, and I wouldlike to address another aspect of the matter, which was an amendment ofLord Greaves on how to fast-track a registration of a common or avillage green. Through my noble Friend Lord Bach, the Governmentpromised to look into how that might be achieved. I know that they havedone so, but I am a little uncertain about what their position is inthis regard.</div> <a name="06042581000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let usaddress a possible scenario. Someone in their later years might wish topass over a piece of land that has been used for many years for acertain purpose&#151;the example of cricket use has been offered. Itmight have been used for that purpose for more than the 20years&#151;that seems to be the key period&#151;but if that personhappens to die before the land is passed over, according to theexisting law, it cannot be seen as either a common or a village green.I wish the Government to make it absolutely clear that there is amechanism whereby if someone wishes to pass a piece of land over foruse by the people for the people that is now possible and that we donot have to wait for the so-called statutory 20 years for that to beachieved. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify exactlywhat resulted from the debate in the otherplace.</div><a name="06042581000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30am</div><a name="06042581000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000428"></a>JimKnight:</b> We have had a wide-ranging debate. I assure theright hon. Member for Penrith and The Border that according to myunderstanding, his understanding is entirely up to scratch. He shouldhave no worries on thatscore.</div><a name="06042581000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It wouldprobably be ideal for all transfers to be recorded as he suggested, butI explained earlier that enforcing such a requirement would bedifficult. We are enabling it because we recognise that it would behelpful for the register to indicate who is entitled to exerciserights. I do not want to disagree with a single word that my nobleFriend the Lord Bach said in the other place. We will enable commonersto enter a supplementary note on the register declaring theirentitlement to exercise rights. The declaration will not be conclusive,but might be informative.</div><a name="06042581000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also exploring thepossibility, which I hope the right hon. Member for Penrith and TheBorder will welcome, of providing in regulations under the Bill that acommoner need not be consulted on any matter affecting the commonunless he has declared his entitlement to those rights. We areexploring that at the moment. It would be an incentive for thosetransfers to be properly registered. If they are not, ownership ofrights and entitlements can be traced back through the Land Registry,but we agree that ideally it would be better to record that informationon the register. That is what we seek to achieve, but we cannot foreseea scenario in which a requirement to do so could be enforced. If,having read what I said earlier, the hon.

That situation mightarise if land had already been used as of right by local inhabitantsfor lawful sports and pastimes for at least 20 years before thedevelopment took place. It would be an unusual circumstance, but itwould be unacceptable if the clause were to allow the registration ofland where houses stand today. The amendments will prevent that fromhappening.

Friend for offering methe opportunity. A judicial decision on the meaning of curtilage wasgiven in the Court of Appeal in 2000. He will recall, being a representative of Nottinghamshire, that the case was Skerritts of NottinghamLtd <i class="I">v.</i> Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and theRegions. The court held that land is considered to be within thecurtilage if it is part and parcel of the principal building or otherstructure. Land is within the curtilage if it is owned and enjoyed withthe principal building and can be regarded as ancillary to it. It is aquestion of fact and degree in each case, and examples include a yard,basement area, passageway, driveway and garden, which are intrinsicallypart and parcel of the house. If houses have been built on one part ofa larger area of <div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>land that has been used as a green, one would not expect the whole ofthe land to be regarded as the curtilage of the houses. If such houseshad physical enclosures around them to create their own space, theircurtilages might well be taken to be defined by those enclosures, butthose curtilages would not extend to the rest of the land.
