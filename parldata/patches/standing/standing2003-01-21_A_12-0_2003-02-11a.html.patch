 to be considered very seriously. When politicians say that doing nothing is not an option, they are digging a pit for themselves to fall into. One should always look first at the case for doing nothing; that is usually better for the Government and for everyone else.<P>
 Adam Smith laid down a long time ago the qualities of good taxation, which include making tax simple and collectable.

 The great merit of the council tax is that it is eminently collectable. The rates of collection are very high, and some authorities are getting close to the maximum, so it is a successful tax in that regard. In principle, council tax was always designed to be a mixture of a tax on property and an individual charge for the cost of delivering services, so it is a mixture of the old rates and the old poll tax. It was designed to have that balance, so to assume that it should be related purely to house values is to distort its origins, and that would be dangerous.

-<B>Mr. Turner:</B> I am happy to support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold and I am not wholly convinced by the Minister's responses. His argument seems to be that if a past Government got it wrong, the current Government are entitled to get it wrong. However, an improved measure of scrutiny is available and would be achieved by incorporation of the amendment. I worry about the importation of what the Minister called non-formulaic measures into his assessment, which means arbitrary or pork barrel. I worry about his use of the word ''generally'' when talking about the consultation because that implies ''sometimes it is not''.<P>

 All hon. Members are concerned from time to time, depending on which party is in Government, about whether the Government are adopting an approach that is fair to their local authorities, tenants and constituents. The best way to judge whether it is fair or to ensure that power is not exercised arbitrarily is to subject it to the parliamentary process—not when the accounts are reviewed a year or so later, but when the procedure is adopted.
 <P>
 I am attracted to the use of the word ''order'' in new paragraph (1) of clause 89(2), which sets out how the calculation should take place. It would not prevent the Minister from taking account of the needs of particular housing management vehicles. In his answer to my hon. Friend, he suggested that that would happen and that he would be deprived of flexibility. Although being required to be up-front about a procedure when it is adopted would deprive him of flexibility, it would not prevent him from taking account of the particular needs of housing management vehicles. For that reason, I hope that my hon. Friend will press the Minister further.

 Well, I think that those authorities should tailor their costs to their rental income. This monstrous clause means that the efficient will subsidise the inefficient.

 <B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was waiting for that question, but I thought it would come not from the Liberals but from the Minister, because he has used the same argument before. The difference is that the Government's proposals are completely arbitrary, whereas ours were formulaic. Every HRA subsidy had to be prepared on the same basis, but that will not be the case once the Bill receives Royal Assent. The provision is arbitrary and unfair.<P>
 <B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman supporting the amendment, or speaking against it? Until now, his argument has been against the clause rather than for the amendment. I hope that he will clarify it.<P>
