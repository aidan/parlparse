 <B>Simon Hughes:</B> This is an important amendment, and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam wants to speak to it if time permits.<P>
 I am troubled by the fact that we have so little time. If we get no further than clause 75 because of the time constraints, 18 clauses, three schedules, 13 new clauses and 53 amendments from today's selection list will remain undebated, irrespective of later provisions that cannot be debated. It is a pity that we cannot have the chance properly to explore such important matters. I hope that my hon. Friend will be permitted to make the substantive points and I thank you, Mr. Illsley, and your co-Chairman, the Clerks and all those who have looked after us. It is not your fault or theirs that we have not had the time we wanted to discuss the Bill.

-<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The clause is entitled ''National security, &c.'' and it is the ''&c.'' with which we have a problem. The national security concept is well understood. In the context of the clause, an individual who has applied at any time for leave to remain or entry clearance to the United Kingdom can be denied the right to appeal through the normal process if that decision was taken on national security grounds. That is clear. The hon. Member for Woking asked whether it appears elsewhere. It appears in clause 4 under the deprivation of citizenship conditions, where it caused equal concern.<P>
