It is important that we get confirmation that the Government would be consistent on this issue, not only in Northern Ireland, but elsewhere. Otherwise, there will be no logic in what the Government are putting forward for Northern Ireland.</p>

If there are inconsistencies, although we might not be able to go further into the consequences now, we will have to investigate them to ensure that Northern Ireland terrorists cannot use them as a means of getting out of a bind there.</p>
