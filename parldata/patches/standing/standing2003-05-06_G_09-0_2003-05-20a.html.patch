 Some important issues are being raised, but misrepresentation and ignorance have been thrown into what has been said as well. The general demand from many parts of the Committee—possibly all parts—is to go much further. I understand that and do not deny that we are discussing a serious problem that must be dealt with. However, that frustration over how we should go further is reinforced—this is a little surprising—by the claim of the Conservative Front-Bench team that what we are proposing does absolutely nothing. The hon. Members for South-East Cambridgeshire and for Surrey Heath suggest that we are not making any changes whatever. They imply that we woke up one morning and thought that we would grab a headline, and that that is what we are doing now.
