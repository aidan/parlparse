 <B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would be failing in my responsibilities as Chairman if I did not remind hon. Members that the normal standards of behaviour in Committee require the prior approval of the Chair before divesting oneself of one's upper garments. However, as I am anxious to ensure that we are able to concentrate without any distraction on the line by line scrutiny on which we have embarked, I am prepared to allow all male Members to divest themselves of their upper garment in this and future sittings, on the condition that we recognise that that is not a relaxation of the normal standards of behaviour.

-<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> We in Aldershot&#151;the home of the British Army&#151;which I represent, apply very high standards, Mr. Cook. You will note that my tie is done up very firmly and that my top button is done up. I hope that I am suitably dressed for your Committee. I speak, of course, as a commissioned officer in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve&#151;
