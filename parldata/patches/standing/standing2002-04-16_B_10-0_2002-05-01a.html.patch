 I am grateful to the Government for reconvening the Programming Sub-Committee this morning. It was a helpful initiative, but they brought that situation on themselves. We have been saying from the outset that the Bill needed a longer Committee stage than it had been given, and even a further day's sittings do not do it justice. We tried to press our views on the Government on how much time we should spend on each part of the Bill, but the usual channels and the Government were not remotely interested, so we have got into this mess.

 In part, the position is remediable by the motion: we will be able to do more justice to the clauses under

 We have not formally introduced such a requirement in the Bill because, not least, we foresee difficulties in drafting it in a workable way. The problem is that it is difficult not to set the test too high and thereby render the clause unworkable in practice.

Surely the onus should be on the commission to justify the idea that certain restrictions should be put in place in what I suspect will be a relatively small number of circumstances.

 Clause 81 will bring into effect a separate but similar enforcement regime for those cases in which the Secretary of State decides to intervene. I should like to highlight the two main differences between the enforcement regime for the Secretary of State and that for normal merger cases. First, the Secretary of State's interim undertaking and order-making powers will cover the period before and after a reference. They will come into effect once the Secretary of State has introduced the intervention notice, which may be before or after the merger has been referred. Those are referred to as pre-emptive undertakings, in order to distinguish them from the OFT's initial orders and the Competition Commission's interim orders and undertakings.

 <B>Mr. Alexander:</B> I sought to clarify the fact that the amendment does not reflect a significant and substantive increase in the powers of the state. It goes to the fundamental basis of our thinking in the Bill, which involves interaction between state and market. We are clearly of the view, as expressed in the White Paper, that a degree of transparency and rigour is welcome, but equally that the authorities should be empowered with the ability to take necessary action, consistent with the provisions that we are discussing, to ensure genuinely competitive markets. If we share the ambition of an enterprising economy, with productivity as well as profits and a genuinely competitive environment in the United Kingdom, there is a serious and important discussion to be had about the best role for individual competition authorities. We are clear that we have struck the right balance in the White Paper and the Bill. It will provide the necessary leadership in competition and enterprise policy to achieve the sort of economy that we are aiming for.

 What worries me slightly is that, particularly when an enterprise is going through an uncertain period and possibly a merger as well, workers can be given conditions such as zero-hour contracts and various other shenanigans can go on. There are problems about whether it is reasonable for a company to merge with the possible intention of giving those highly deleterious working conditions to an entire group of workers rather than to one part of it. I wonder whether the Minister might consider that there could be occasions when the paragraph might work against the interests of a work force, rather than protect their rights, as was its intention.

 <B>Mr. Alexander:</B> I shall try to offer what assurance I can to the hon. Gentleman. Under paragraph 20, the authorities will have regard to the need to exclude information that would be contrary to the public interest or that might significantly harm legitimate business interests or individuals' interests. They must also have regard to the need to disclose information that will ensure effective enforcements. That is the basis on which the paragraph was drafted. I hope that that answers his question.
