 <B>Mr. Djanogly:</B> I want to speak a little more about the clause as a whole and subsection (3), in particular. It starts off well, but then goes rapidly down hill. It states:
 <P>
-<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The decisions of the Commission&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;. shall be consistent with its decisions as included in its report".
+<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The decisions of the Commission ... shall be consistent with its decisions as included in its report".
 <P>
 </font></UL>That is what everyone, particularly those in business, want because it implies fairness and consistency. However, the remainder of the clause blows a hole in that principle. It says that the decision may change if there is a material change in the circumstances since the report was produced and that the decision may be changed if the commission has any special reason for so doing. That does not point well towards fairness or consistency in all situations.
 <w><P>I should be grateful for the Under-Secretary's comments on some points. First, what would be material in such circumstances? Secondly, the circumstances of the company may be such that the causation is beyond its control. Would that make a difference? Thirdly, would any change to the Competition Commission's decision be only to take no action or less action, or could it decide to take more action? If it took more action&#151;action that would be tougher on the company concerned&#151;would the company be asked for its input or be able to comment on the altered circumstances that led to a change in the commission's decision? Could the company take that change of mind to the CAT as an issue in itself? Finally, can the Under-Secretary elaborate on what constitutes special reasons? Is she or her Department planning to issue guidance on the matter?

 This is a short point. Subsection (1) states:
 <P>
-<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where an intervention notice &thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.  comes into force in relation to a market investigation reference, sections 126 and 128 to 130 shall cease to apply in relation to that reference."
+<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where an intervention notice ...  comes into force in relation to a market investigation reference, sections 126 and 128 to 130 shall cease to apply in relation to that reference."
 <P>
 </font></UL>This is all part of our eternal quest to improve, brush up and generally make the Bill a wonderful addition to the statute book. Surely there are definitions in clause 126 that are essential to the working of clause 143. Why, therefore, should they cease to apply? It is a probing amendment. I suspect that the draftsman's word processor slipped again, and I look forward to hearing what the Under-Secretary has to say.

 Hon. Members will be aware of ways in which competition policy is used by the American Government, who sometimes provide ways of producing products that threaten competitors in a market&#151;banana or sugar producers, for example. Other players in the market may be threatened, not simply with having to liquidate their businesses, but with paying for the competition culture with their lives or with the prospect of curtailing forever their chance of earning a livelihood.

However, it is incumbent on us to pay attention to the wider framework and ensure that we do not end up with a competition policy that is antithetical to our ideas about what constitutes fair competition in the world of commerce.
