 <B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman the impression that I am against the expansion of the EU. Far from it. I am simply pointing out and I should have thought that he would be concerned about it on behalf of his constituents, that some of the countries that may be joining the EU simply do not have our traditions of the protection of the subject. Throughout my ten and a half years in the House and for many years before that, I have known that Labour Members are concerned about civil liberties and the freedom of the individual. That is quite right. If they are so concerned, they should consider having proper parliamentary scrutiny over which countries will be allowed to operate the provisions before us.<P>
 It would be quite different if we were talking only about terrorists. The threat from terrorism is so exceptional that one could just about accept draconian powers. But we are faced with a vast undefined list of vague offences. There are 32 categories of offence, many of which are not offences under UK law, and we are talking about courts that have no tradition of the protection of the subject. I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman asked his constituents, he would find that they share our concerns.

-<B>Mr. George Howarth </B>(Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) Is not the difference between European states and, for example, Australia the fact that the European states signed up to the European convention on extradition in 1991, when we had a Conservative Government? Whatever the workings of the courts in individual nation states, the principles in the convention govern the way that they must deal with extradition. That is the difference between those states and Australia.<P>

 <B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> On paper, they do. I do not know whether any of the hon. Gentleman's constituents were involved in the appalling Kalamata British plane-spotters case. [Interruption.] He shakes his head. If his constituents had been involved, I doubt whether they would have been terribly happy with the protection that they felt they were given by the Greek courts. Yet Greece is one of the EU countries that have signed up to all the principles in the convention. The British citizens who were quite improperly arrested were acquitted in the end, but only after 37 days during which they had to be in Greece, either in custody or waiting for the case to be concluded. I do not think that those people would be at all happy at the thought that Greece having signed up to anything would provide them with sufficient protection.<P>
 <B>Mr. Harris:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he and his party are now opposed to the European convention on extradition, which a Conservative Government signed in 1991, or are they simply opposed to the new measures in the Bill?<P>
