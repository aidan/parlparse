Welcome back to theCommittee after the bank holiday weekend.</div><a name="0605023000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before speaking to theamendments, I wish to say a few words about the context of our debatesso far and our forthcoming debate on this part of the Bill, which dealswith school admissions. I hope that that will be helpful to theofficial Opposition, who on more than one occasion have questioned myviews on certainmatters.</div><a name="0605023000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to methat the way in which the official Opposition have approached the Bill,especially questions relating to admissions and the relationship withthe local authority, is not the most useful framework for increasingour understanding of how to build an education system that helps tofulfil the potential of all children. Their view is that there is adichotomy of those who believe that all our schools should be withinthe local education authority and those who believe that they shouldall be free-standing, independent schools with minimal connection withthe LEA. Furthermore, there are those who believe that there should beno LEAs at all. It is not helpful to consider the Bill in such terms.The issue is far more complex than that.</div><a name="0605023000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, traditionally theofficial Opposition have regarded the debate on admissions as a debatebetween those who believe in selection and those who are opposed to it.They have simplified that into debate on grammar schools andcomprehensive schools, or grammar school systems. It is interesting howselective <div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 551</div>systems are always described as grammar school systems, not secondarymodern school systems, but we will leave that to one side for themoment.</div><a name="0605023000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000310"></a><b class="B">Mr.John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): That isa caricature of the mission of the official Opposition. We voted forthe Bill in the full understanding that it retains a role for LEAs: agood example of such a function that I value greatly is statementingspecial needs children. We would have voted against the Bill had weheld the opinion that the hon. Gentleman ascribes tous.</div><a name="0605023000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000311"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment,although he is, of course, in the vanguard of thinking in his party onsuch matters and I suspect that his views are not shared by the generalmass of hiscolleagues.</div><a name="0605023000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000312"></a><b class="B">Mrs.Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): Could the reasonwe refer to selective systems as grammar school systems, not secondarymodern school systems, be that we still have grammar schools, but nolonger have secondary modern schools? Speaking as a secondarymodern-educated person, I do not believe that anyone in the room wouldadvocate a return to the secondary modernsystem.</div><a name="0605023000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000313"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> No it could not, because we still have secondarymodern schools. If the hon. Lady checks the list of categories ofschool held by the Department for Education and Skills, she will seethat it contains several secondary modern schools. Although not allnon-selective schools in wholly selective areas are defined officiallyas secondary modern schools, they have, in effect, the same status asthose schools that used to be defined assuch.</div><a name="0605023000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000314"></a>Mrs.Dorries:</b> Is it not a failure of the Government that afteralmost 10 years in power, secondary modern schools are still inexistence? Are they not operating a comprehensivesystem?</div><a name="0605023000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000315"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point. If shecan be patient, I shall comment further on the grammar-comprehensivedivision in the hope of clarifying the point. The way in which theDepartment classifies our schools probably bears little relationship toreality. Some schools that are classified as secondary modernschools&#151;perhaps in Kent, Slough or Buckinghamshire&#151;have afar more comprehensive intake than some of the schools that areofficially classified as comprehensive schools. I am glad that shepicked up on my remarks on the important question of how schools areclassified. My preference would be simply to call them&#147;schools&#148;, but perhaps that is an idea whose time has notyet come.</div><a name="0605023000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It isimportant to raise the issue now, because for50 years oureducation debate has been too much hung up on the names that we giveschools. I do not believe that the concept of a grammar school is aprecise or accurate one, because some grammar schools are whollyselective state schools, some are non-selective state schools, and someare private schools that select to a greater or lesser degree byability and by the size of <div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 552</div>the parents&#146; chequebook. The term &#147;grammar school&#148;is not helpful, nor is the term &#147;comprehensive school&#148;,which embraces an enormous range of schools with an enormous diversityof intake. We need to get away from the traditional framework ofdivisions between selection and non-selection, and between the controland running of schools by LEAs and a system of free-standingindependentschools.</div><a name="0605023000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000316"></a><b class="B">Mr.Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Is notwhat we need to get away from the ideological obsession with intake andthe assumption that the intake of a school determines its quality? Thereason for the degree of passion about school intakesis thatthere are too few good schools in thiscountry, with 23 percent. officially regarded as underperforming. Should not the priorityof all Members of Parliament be to create more good schools so thatthere is not such a clamour by parents to get their children into thefew good schools that exist? That, not admissions, should be ourobsession.</div><a name="0605023000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000317"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I agree completely that our objective should beto create more good schools; paradoxically, that would make our currentobsession with choice became less relevant. If more good schools wereavailable, individual parents would be less anxious about their choiceof school, because the choice that they made would be less significantto and have less of an impact on their children&#146;s education.However, I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that therehas been an ideological obsession with intake; nor do I accept thatintake is irrelevant to the objective of building a system in which allschools are good schools.</div><a name="0605023000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">To continue my generalremarks&#151;I beg your indulgence, Mr. Chope: I shall move on to thespecifics of the amendments shortly&#151;the real issue seems to meto be not a battle between independent schools and LEA-controlledschools but the correct balance of decision making between theGovernment in Westminster, the local authority, school governors and parents. It is interesting that so much of the debate in Committee sofar has focused on the level at which decisions should be taken. Somehave said that certain matters should be determined by parents; othershave said that certain matters are for the governing body to determine.The Opposition have criticised the Government for being too centralist.The Government have argued that they want to increase parentpower.</div> <a name="0605023000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argumenthas moved back and forth between the Government and the Opposition, andthe central theme of the Bill seems to be securing the rightdecision-making structure, getting the right decisions taken at theright level and ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights ofparents and school governing bodies and the democratic responsibilitiesof local authorities and central Government. We must therefore focusfirst on what decision-making structure would be best, and then on whatrelationship between local authorities and the schools in their areawould be best.</div> <a name="0605023000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thehon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), with whom I have some thingsin common and many differences, has said that he deeply regrets thefactthat the Conservative Government who passed the <div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 553</div>Education Reform Act 1988 did not go the whole way and allow all schoolsto opt out. He and other members of the Committee may be interested toknow that, within weeks of the Act receiving Royal Assent, I madeprecisely that argument&#151;albeit for different reasons from thehon. Gentleman&#146;s&#151;to my colleagues on the educationcommittee on which I was serving at the time. I argued that the onlyway in which we could conceivably maintain a coherent and equitablesystem following the passing of the Act, which I did not support, wasfor all schools to retain the same status: either all should stay in,or all should opt out.</div><a name="0605023000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was an element ofmischievousness in that argument: it would have been impossible for allschools to opt out, because the Government of the day were not preparedto allocate the funding necessary for all of them to becomegrant-maintained. Some of us thought that the way to defeat thelegislation was to highlight that anomaly as forcefully as possible,but that was not the majority view of my party or my colleagues. We allknow the history of the past 18 years: the opting-out process has ledto more inequality in the system and a greater hierarchy of schools, aswell as greater differences in funding, both capital and revenue,particularly in secondaryschools.</div><a name="0605023000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000318"></a><b class="B">Mr.Edward Leigh</b> (Gainsborough) (Con): It is strange, is itnot, that the two outriders on the Committee agree on the fundamentalpoint that all schools should be treated the same, regardless offunding? The Minister may wish to note that. We do not benefit thesystem by creating types of schools that opt of the system, such ascityacademies.</div><a name="0605023000038"></a></td></tr></table><a name="end"><table width=90%><tr valign=top><td colspan=2>&nbsp;<br><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/e/st060502/am/60502s02.htm"/>

Welcome back to theCommittee after the bank holiday weekend.</div><a name="0605023000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before speaking to theamendments, I wish to say a few words about the context of our debatesso far and our forthcoming debate on this part of the Bill, which dealswith school admissions. I hope that that will be helpful to theofficial Opposition, who on more than one occasion have questioned myviews on certainmatters.</div><a name="0605023000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to methat the way in which the official Opposition have approached the Bill,especially questions relating to admissions and the relationship withthe local authority, is not the most useful framework for increasingour understanding of how to build an education system that helps tofulfil the potential of all children. Their view is that there is adichotomy of those who believe that all our schools should be withinthe local education authority and those who believe that they shouldall be free-standing, independent schools with minimal connection withthe LEA. Furthermore, there are those who believe that there should beno LEAs at all. It is not helpful to consider the Bill in such terms.The issue is far more complex than that.</div><a name="0605023000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, traditionally theofficial Opposition have regarded the debate on admissions as a debatebetween those who believe in selection and those who are opposed to it.They have simplified that into debate on grammar schools andcomprehensive schools, or grammar school systems. It is interesting howselective <div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 551</div>systems are always described as grammar school systems, not secondarymodern school systems, but we will leave that to one side for themoment.</div><a name="0605023000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000310"></a><b class="B">Mr.John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): That isa caricature of the mission of the official Opposition.

Speaking as a secondarymodern-educated person, I do not believe that anyone in the room wouldadvocate a return to the secondary modernsystem.</div><a name="0605023000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000313"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> No it could not, because we still have secondarymodern schools. If the hon. Lady checks the list of categories ofschool held by the Department for Education and Skills, she will seethat it contains several secondary modern schools. Although not allnon-selective schools in wholly selective areas are defined officiallyas secondary modern schools, they have, in effect, the same status asthose schools that used to be defined assuch.</div><a name="0605023000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000314"></a>Mrs.Dorries:</b> Is it not a failure of the Government that afteralmost 10 years in power, secondary modern schools are still inexistence?

If shecan be patient, I shall comment further on the grammar-comprehensivedivision in the hope of clarifying the point. The way in which theDepartment classifies our schools probably bears little relationship toreality. Some schools that are classified as secondary modernschools&#151;perhaps in Kent, Slough or Buckinghamshire&#151;have afar more comprehensive intake than some of the schools that areofficially classified as comprehensive schools. I am glad that shepicked up on my remarks on the important question of how schools areclassified. My preference would be simply to call them&#147;schools&#148;, but perhaps that is an idea whose time has notyet come.</div><a name="0605023000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It isimportant to raise the issue now, because for50 years oureducation debate has been too much hung up on the names that we giveschools. I do not believe that the concept of a grammar school is aprecise or accurate one, because some grammar schools are whollyselective state schools, some are non-selective state schools, and someare private schools that select to a greater or lesser degree byability and by the size of <div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 552</div>the parents&#146; chequebook. The term &#147;grammar school&#148;is not helpful, nor is the term &#147;comprehensive school&#148;,which embraces an enormous range of schools with an enormous diversityof intake. We need to get away from the traditional framework ofdivisions between selection and non-selection, and between the controland running of schools by LEAs and a system of free-standingindependentschools.</div><a name="0605023000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000316"></a><b class="B">Mr.Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Is notwhat we need to get away from the ideological obsession with intake andthe assumption that the intake of a school determines its quality? Thereason for the degree of passion about school intakesis thatthere are too few good schools in thiscountry, with 23 percent. officially regarded as underperforming. Should not the priorityof all Members of Parliament be to create more good schools so thatthere is not such a clamour by parents to get their children into thefew good schools that exist? That, not admissions, should be ourobsession.</div><a name="0605023000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000317"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I agree completely that our objective should beto create more good schools; paradoxically, that would make our currentobsession with choice became less relevant. If more good schools wereavailable, individual parents would be less anxious about their choiceof school, because the choice that they made would be less significantto and have less of an impact on their children&#146;s education.However, I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that therehas been an ideological obsession with intake; nor do I accept thatintake is irrelevant to the objective of building a system in which allschools are good schools.</div><a name="0605023000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">To continue my generalremarks&#151;I beg your indulgence, Mr. Chope: I shall move on to thespecifics of the amendments shortly&#151;the real issue seems to meto be not a battle between independent schools and LEA-controlledschools but the correct balance of decision making between theGovernment in Westminster, the local authority, school governors and parents. It is interesting that so much of the debate in Committee sofar has focused on the level at which decisions should be taken. Somehave said that certain matters should be determined by parents; othershave said that certain matters are for the governing body to determine.The Opposition have criticised the Government for being too centralist.The Government have argued that they want to increase parentpower.</div> <a name="0605023000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argumenthas moved back and forth between the Government and the Opposition, andthe central theme of the Bill seems to be securing the rightdecision-making structure, getting the right decisions taken at theright level and ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights ofparents and school governing bodies and the democratic responsibilitiesof local authorities and central Government. We must therefore focusfirst on what decision-making structure would be best, and then on whatrelationship between local authorities and the schools in their areawould be best.</div> <a name="0605023000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thehon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), with whom I have some thingsin common and many differences, has said that he deeply regrets thefactthat the Conservative Government who passed the <div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 553</div>Education Reform Act 1988 did not go the whole way and allow all schoolsto opt out. He and other members of the Committee may be interested toknow that, within weeks of the Act receiving Royal Assent, I madeprecisely that argument&#151;albeit for different reasons from thehon. Gentleman&#146;s&#151;to my colleagues on the educationcommittee on which I was serving at the time. I argued that the onlyway in which we could conceivably maintain a coherent and equitablesystem following the passing of the Act, which I did not support, wasfor all schools to retain the same status: either all should stay in,or all should opt out.</div><a name="0605023000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was an element ofmischievousness in that argument: it would have been impossible for allschools to opt out, because the Government of the day were not preparedto allocate the funding necessary for all of them to becomegrant-maintained. Some of us thought that the way to defeat thelegislation was to highlight that anomaly as forcefully as possible,but that was not the majority view of my party or my colleagues. We allknow the history of the past 18 years: the opting-out process has ledto more inequality in the system and a greater hierarchy of schools, aswell as greater differences in funding, both capital and revenue,particularly in secondaryschools.</div><a name="0605023000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605023000318"></a><b class="B">Mr.Edward Leigh</b> (Gainsborough) (Con): It is strange, is itnot, that the two outriders on the Committee agree on the fundamentalpoint that all schools should be treated the same, regardless offunding?

I was grateful that thehon.

I do notknow of anybody who has argued for the abolition of any grammar schoolssince the days of Margaret Thatcher, who was the last Secretary ofState to suggest abolishing grammar schools and abolished a largenumber of them. We have got to get away from the idea of <div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 585</div>abolishing schools or not supporting good schools. Wherever there aregood schools, I want more children to be able to attend them. However,we cannot consider schools in isolation from the wider system in whichthey operate.</div> <a name="0605023000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Themerit in my amendment is that the status quo would apply until 2010,after which there would be an end to selection throughout the country.However, selection would still be subject to the existing rules onparental ballots; in areas that are currently wholly or partlyselective, parents would still have the right to vote on whether to goahead with ending selection in 2010. That is entirely in line with our1997 manifesto policy that, ultimately, such matters should bedetermined by parents. All I am arguing for is that the Governmentshould change the default position and see through the logic of theirown position on selection&#151;and the logic of the LiberalDemocrats&#146; position and the Conservatives&#146; officialposition.</div><a name="0605023000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wantto digress for too long, because lunch time is approaching, but while Iam on this subject I shall say a little more. I have retrieved theshadow Secretary of State&#146;s quote that I mentioned, and it isimportant that we get it on the record. Recently, on Teachers&#146;TV, hesaid:</div><a name="0605023000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lookingback to my friends from primary school, the brutality of theeleven-plus and the ones who went to secondary moderns that is one ofthe problems with theeleven-plus.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tosay that there was not much grammar in that sentence.

We need an open,transparent public debate, not framed simply by arguments about themerits of individual categories of school, but focusing on theimplications of particular admissionspolicies.</div><a name="0605023000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have arguedthat 11 is far too early to select children on the grounds of academicability. Given that we now have a national curriculum, it is almostimpossible to see the logic of segregating children at 11. I understandthat, 30 or 40 years ago, long before the national curriculum, thosewho did not go to selective schools did not pursue externalexaminations and, as late as 1970, therefore 50 per cent. of them leftschool without a single qualification to their name. I can see that inthose days there was at least a logic in segregating children at theage of 11. Now that all children follow the national curriculum up tothe age of 16, however, it is increasingly hard to understand what thepurpose is. As hon. Members on both sides of the House know, the realpurpose is social segregation, not the liberation of eachchild&#146;s intellectual potential.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 586</div><a name="0605023000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have proposed severalalternatives. For example, in certain areas&#151;I know some of themwell, although I do not wish to name them&#151;the best solution,which would be to the advantage of all children, would be to change thecharacter of the existing wholly selective schools so that they becamesixth form colleges. Perhaps, in other areas, the option of a 14-to-19school may be pursued, which would be an easy way of enabling morepeople to gain access to the current wholly selective schools. It mayalso be that, in some areas, parents would see the advantages of simplyallowing the existing grammar schools to expand on the basis of amixed-ability intake, whereby all children who entered after 2010 wouldbe of mixed ability.</div><a name="0605023000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Myrecollection is that, early in the Government&#146;s first term, Ipublished a Bill on the 10 per cent. issue. The proposals in my Billwere based on the argument that, having reached 10 per cent. byaptitude, the logical way of dealing with the remaining wholly orpartially selective schools would be to bring down the proportion ofchildren that they admitted from 100 per cent., to 90 per cent., then80 per cent., gradually in stages, until it also reached 10 per cent.All schools would then be able to select a maximum of 10 per cent.,either on grounds of ability or aptitude. There is an argument to bemade for universal entitlement to10 per cent. selection, sothat all schools would be able to select that proportion based onability or aptitude. I do not wish to pursue that argument, but it is apossibility.</div><a name="0605023000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000403"></a>Mr.Leigh:</b> A fascinating possibility just occurred to me. Thehon. Gentleman has made the interesting point that there is logic inallowing all schools to select 10 per cent. by ability. I understandthat that would be the view of the official Opposition. I suspect that,even if my free-for-all solution, which is viewed as so radical, everhappened, most schools would probably move to that position. So it is areal possibility that, if the different models proposed by the hon.Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehamptonand myself all happened, we would all veer toward the samething&#151;which I suppose is life, is itnot?</div><a name="0605023000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000404"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. The moresuch issues are discussed outside the traditional framework of blackand white or either/or solutions, the more we are likely to move towardsolutions based on sound educational reasons, rather than on historicalattempts to defend socialprivilege.</div><a name="0605023000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of theConservative party&#146;s difficulties, which has trapped it over theyears and led its more forward-thinking members to abandon the oldpolicy of wanting a grammar school in every town, is that its argumentsare increasingly outdated, inaccurate or irrelevant. Conservativesalways refer to social mobility. A number of recent academic studieshave identified a slow-down in social mobility in this country. Forinstance, the LSE study lists a number of factors that may havecontributed to that, one of which is the change in the nature of theadmissions policy for secondary schools. However, the study doesnot&#151;as the hon.

I was grateful that thehon. Member for Gainsborough appreciated that there is no logic in thecurrent arrangements; they are arbitrary and arbitrary solutions do notnecessarily deliver the bestresults.</div><a name="0605023000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">On intake, itis not a simple matter of abolishing certain kinds of schools. I do notknow of anybody who has argued for the abolition of any grammar schoolssince the days of Margaret Thatcher, who was the last Secretary ofState to suggest abolishing grammar schools and abolished a largenumber of them. We have got to get away from the idea of <div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 585</div>abolishing schools or not supporting good schools. Wherever there aregood schools, I want more children to be able to attend them. However,we cannot consider schools in isolation from the wider system in whichthey operate.</div> <a name="0605023000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Themerit in my amendment is that the status quo would apply until 2010,after which there would be an end to selection throughout the country.However, selection would still be subject to the existing rules onparental ballots; in areas that are currently wholly or partlyselective, parents would still have the right to vote on whether to goahead with ending selection in 2010. That is entirely in line with our1997 manifesto policy that, ultimately, such matters should bedetermined by parents. All I am arguing for is that the Governmentshould change the default position and see through the logic of theirown position on selection&#151;and the logic of the LiberalDemocrats&#146; position and the Conservatives&#146; officialposition.</div><a name="0605023000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wantto digress for too long, because lunch time is approaching, but while Iam on this subject I shall say a little more. I have retrieved theshadow Secretary of State&#146;s quote that I mentioned, and it isimportant that we get it on the record. Recently, on Teachers&#146;TV, hesaid:</div><a name="0605023000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lookingback to my friends from primary school, the brutality of theeleven-plus and the ones who went to secondary moderns that is one ofthe problems with theeleven-plus.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tosay that there was not much grammar in that sentence. Hecontinued:</div><a name="0605023000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It'swhy David Cameron and I have said that we won't go back to theeleven-plus in parts of the country where it's disappeared, &#146;cosI think&#148;&#151;</div> <a name="0605023000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">heactually said, &#147;&#146;cos I think&#148;; I would notnormally expect him to use that word, but perhaps one of his brains wasnot in gear at thatmoment&#151;</div><a name="0605023000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;choosingat 11 whether someone can benefit from academic education ornot...there's too many kids who develop after 11 and are not inthe appropriateschool.&#148;</div><a name="0605023000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there we haveit: the words of the shadow Secretary of Statehimself.</div><a name="0605023000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">A range ofoptions could be considered to replace the status quo. We need an open,transparent public debate, not framed simply by arguments about themerits of individual categories of school, but focusing on theimplications of particular admissionspolicies.</div><a name="0605023000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have arguedthat 11 is far too early to select children on the grounds of academicability. Given that we now have a national curriculum, it is almostimpossible to see the logic of segregating children at 11. I understandthat, 30 or 40 years ago, long before the national curriculum, thosewho did not go to selective schools did not pursue externalexaminations and, as late as 1970, therefore 50 per cent. of them leftschool without a single qualification to their name. I can see that inthose days there was at least a logic in segregating children at theage of 11. Now that all children follow the national curriculum up tothe age of 16, however, it is increasingly hard to understand what thepurpose is. As hon. Members on both sides of the House know, the realpurpose is social segregation, not the liberation of eachchild&#146;s intellectual potential.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 586</div><a name="0605023000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have proposed severalalternatives. For example, in certain areas&#151;I know some of themwell, although I do not wish to name them&#151;the best solution,which would be to the advantage of all children, would be to change thecharacter of the existing wholly selective schools so that they becamesixth form colleges. Perhaps, in other areas, the option of a 14-to-19school may be pursued, which would be an easy way of enabling morepeople to gain access to the current wholly selective schools. It mayalso be that, in some areas, parents would see the advantages of simplyallowing the existing grammar schools to expand on the basis of amixed-ability intake, whereby all children who entered after 2010 wouldbe of mixed ability.</div><a name="0605023000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Myrecollection is that, early in the Government&#146;s first term, Ipublished a Bill on the 10 per cent. issue. The proposals in my Billwere based on the argument that, having reached 10 per cent. byaptitude, the logical way of dealing with the remaining wholly orpartially selective schools would be to bring down the proportion ofchildren that they admitted from 100 per cent., to 90 per cent., then80 per cent., gradually in stages, until it also reached 10 per cent.All schools would then be able to select a maximum of 10 per cent.,either on grounds of ability or aptitude. There is an argument to bemade for universal entitlement to10 per cent. selection, sothat all schools would be able to select that proportion based onability or aptitude. I do not wish to pursue that argument, but it is apossibility.</div><a name="0605023000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000403"></a>Mr.Leigh:</b> A fascinating possibility just occurred to me. Thehon. Gentleman has made the interesting point that there is logic inallowing all schools to select 10 per cent. by ability. I understandthat that would be the view of the official Opposition. I suspect that,even if my free-for-all solution, which is viewed as so radical, everhappened, most schools would probably move to that position. So it is areal possibility that, if the different models proposed by the hon.Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehamptonand myself all happened, we would all veer toward the samething&#151;which I suppose is life, is itnot?</div><a name="0605023000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605023000404"></a>Mr.Chaytor:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. The moresuch issues are discussed outside the traditional framework of blackand white or either/or solutions, the more we are likely to move towardsolutions based on sound educational reasons, rather than on historicalattempts to defend socialprivilege.</div><a name="0605023000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of theConservative party&#146;s difficulties, which has trapped it over theyears and led its more forward-thinking members to abandon the oldpolicy of wanting a grammar school in every town, is that its argumentsare increasingly outdated, inaccurate or irrelevant. Conservativesalways refer to social mobility. A number of recent academic studieshave identified a slow-down in social mobility in this country. Forinstance, the LSE study lists a number of factors that may havecontributed to that, one of which is the change in the nature of theadmissions policy for secondary schools. However, the study doesnot&#151;as the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepingswrongly asserted&#151;conclude that social mobility has slowed downas a direct result of the change in the <div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 587</div>admissions policy for secondary schools.
