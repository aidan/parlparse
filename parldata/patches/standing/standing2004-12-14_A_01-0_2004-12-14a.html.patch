 <p>The Sub-Committee&#039;s draft resolution sets out the number of sittings that the House has allowed us, and with an element of organisation and marshalling&#151;and some logic&#151;it includes a timetable. I know that the Bill will be dispatched with good humour. I promised on Second Reading that I would provide commentary, including a rough schedule of the regulations and guidance&#151;they are to be found on the Table&#151;and a range of other elements, because, like most legislation, the Bill needs to be seen in the wider context and<br>
+because we are also doing a range of things in the non-legislative dimension. The latter are as important as the Bill, and I am sure that we will come to them subsequently.
+The motion is eminently logical and it has integrity. The timetable for the 10 sittings is set out in a way that should provide fun and entertainment, after which the Bill will be reported to the House and sent on its travels. I commend the motion to the Committee.
+
+<P><b>Mr. Greg Knight (East Yorkshire) (Con): </b>I associate myself with at least some of the Minister&#039;s remarks. I certainly hope that the Committee remains good natured. We have a good chance of that with you in the Chair, Mr. Griffiths. Nevertheless, I notice that the Clock facing me is showing the same time now as it did when the Minister started speaking.

 <p>It will not have escaped the Committee&#039;s attention that the motion is in two parts. We all accept the need for the first part, as we need a framework so that we know the dates and times when we are to sit. However, the Opposition do not accept that the second part is either desirable or necessary. The danger is that what becomes commonplace will become acceptable. I therefore place on record our view that the timetable is not only unnecessary, but in many respects objectionable.
