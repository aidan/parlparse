Having chatted to my hon. Friend the Whip, I shall be evenbriefer than Ithought.</div><a name="060425125000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point ofthe amendments is to sort out the issue of the possible exchange ofland. Amendment No. 71 would ensure that there is no de minimis size ofland resulting in land being nibbled away. It would also impose a timeconstraint restricting the degree to which land can be released insuccessive periods, so that we do not see it gone beforelong.</div> <a name="060425125000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.72 is straightforward. It would make it clear that it is wrong toprovide a piece of so-called open space as an alternative to theconstituted village green or common land. I am sure that that ruse hasbeen played on all hon. Members: someone offers the village what wasalready a piece of open space on the grounds that it is secured forever and a day, when the village is losing a piece of common land thatis just as valuable or even more valuable. I hope that that amendmentis clear.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="060425125000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly want theMinister to respond to amendment No. 70. It would guarantee that avoluntary exchange of common land or a village green would be subjectto the same test as compulsorily purchased land. Section 19(1)(a) ofthe Acquisition of Land Act 1981 requires that land given in exchangemust be no less in area than the other land and must be &#147;equallyadvantageous&#148; to anypersons</div><a name="060425125000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;entitled torights of common or other rights, and to thepublic,&#148;</div><a name="060425125000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">who now have aright to walk on all commons under the Countryside and Rights of WayAct 2000.</div> <a name="060425125000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theamendment would ensure that what is received is no worse than what isgiven, provide a clear yardstick for exchanges as well as compulsorypurchase and obtain a subsequent guarantee from the Minister that itwould apply to the de-registration, exchange and registration of landtaking the place of the land being lost. It is very clear, and I knowthat the Minister will be dying to accept theamendments.</div><a name="060425125000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000209"></a><b class="B">Mr.Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): We, too,support the amendments. Village and town greens are precious to thosecommunities able to enjoy them. We know of many towns and villages thatwould like to have a village green for all the benefits that accruefrom them but do not have one. We often see encroachment on thoseprecious areas of land, sometimes in small bites. Theamendments&#146; strength is that they address that. The loss of avery small piece of a green is an important matter for thecommunity.</div> <a name="060425125000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.Members who tabled the amendments have made their points, so I will notrepeat them, but it is up to the Minister to respond to the amendmentsas positively as he can. The communities affected by such problemswould hold him in the highest esteem if he let his defences down ashade and let somebody slip the quicker ball through and get aresult.</div><a name="060425125000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000210"></a>TheParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and RuralAffairs (Jim Knight):</b> I recall that during debates on theNatural Environment and Rural Communities Bill the hon. Gentlemanpromised that I would be held in the highest esteem in respect of somerace between horses, men and all sorts of things&#151;it got himnowhere theneither.</div><a name="060425125000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listenedcarefully to my hon. Friends. I said that I always pay close attentionto my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping); I try to dothe same for my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) as well,although sometimes he does not make that as easy. My hon. Friends makeimportant points and I support the intentions behind their amendments.</div><a name="060425125000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I shallresist the amendments. Clause 16 strikes the right balance forflexibility, and I shall take time to persuade my hon. Friends and thehon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) that we have gotit right. If the proposed release land has an area of more than 200 sqm, replacement land must be offered&#151;no ifs or buts. That isclear. It would apply whenever release land had an area greater than,say, 20 m by 10 m. However, I know that my hon. Friends and the hon.Gentleman are concerned that small areas of land would be eaten away.They want to prevent nibbling, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroudput it.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="060425125000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could the status of smaller areas of land be swept away as unimportant? Far from it. Unless the applicant proposes replacement land, there is an absolute duty on the national authority, under subsection (7), to have particular regard to the extent to which the absence of replacement land would be prejudicial to any of the interests in the land. The authority must think about the property rights of the commoners or others, the interestsof the neighbourhood and the public interest in all senses of thephrase, including nature conservation, landscape conservation,protection of public rights of access and protection of archaeological remains or other historic features.</div><a name="060425125000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">That list is prettyformidable. In the vast majority of cases, when the area of proposedrelease land is less than 200 sq m, replacement land of a comparablesize or quality will need to be provided if the proposal is to beapproved. A case of deregistration without exchange being approvedwould be truly exceptional, but we do not want to rule out thepossibility.</div><a name="060425125000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shallgive an example. Suppose an area of common or green were landlocked byhouses and no land nearby could be used as replacement land. Let ussuppose that there was a proposal to take a very small proportion ofthe land to facilitate, shall we say, disabled access to some adjoiningcommunity facility, and that that proposal was supported overwhelminglyby local people because it really made sense. Although such a casewould be exceptional, we would not want it to be impossible for us toapprove that application because of what was instatute.</div><a name="060425125000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">What of theother issues raised by the amendments? Should there be a requirement orstatutory expectation that replacement land should be at least as largeas the release land, or equally advantageous to the various users ofit? We do not think so, for the same reason. Of course, it would beexceptional for the replacement land to be smaller, but we do not wantto rule out the possibility altogether. Such a proposal could provide abetter deal for the commoners and the public. Perhaps the release landwould be inaccessible and remote, while the slightly smallerreplacement land was on people&#146;s doorstep, but had not hithertobeen available to them. In such circumstances, we should not be forcedto turn down an application because ofstatutes.</div><a name="060425125000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We resistthe &#147;equally advantageous&#148; formulation simply because itcould well be interpreted as meaning that the replacement land had tobe equally advantageous in respect of every one of the interests setout in clause 16(6), which is a much extended list of the issues towhich the national authority must have regard when an exchange isproposed. Currently, the national authority is concerned only withwhether an exchange is fair to the private interests involved;subsection (6) would also include the public interest.</div><a name="060425125000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member forStroud mentioned the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. He was right to saythat in the case he mentioned replacement land due to a compulsorypurchase order would have to be equally advantageous to any commoners,other legal right holders and the public. This is the closestcomparable example. However, the deregistration and exchange provisionsin clause 16 involve considering the impact of proposals on a far widerset of interests than even those in that legislation, includingthe</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="060425125000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;interests of theneighbourhood...nature conservation...the conservation of thelandscape...the protection of public rights of access...andthe protection of archeological remains and features of historicinterest.&#148;</div> <a name="060425125000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is adifference, and there would be a potential legal problem if we were toopen up the possibility that all those interests must be equally servedby the exchange land.</div><a name="060425125000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000211"></a>Mr.Drew:</b> I am very pleased that subsection (8) defines thepublic interest. The problem is that we do not define what we mean bythe &#147;interests of the neighbourhood&#148; and how that wouldbe reflected. With the best will in the world, that is where theconflict is most likely to occur. For example, a group of people mightsee the exchange as somewhat less advantageous, but the landowner andperhaps a larger authority, which could have already granted planningpermission, might say, &#147;We think this should take place&#148;.How do we measure those conflicting interests? Perhaps that issueshould be taken on board.</div><a name="060425125000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000212"></a>JimKnight:</b> My hon. Friend raises an interesting point aboutthe definition of the &#147;interests of the neighbourhood&#148;.Clearly, it is up to the registration authority to make decisions on acase-by-case basis as to whether an exchange is reasonable and whetherit balances all those interests up. As things stand, it will have todefine the &#147;interests of the neighbourhood&#148;. I shallreflect on whether we need to flesh that out a little in some form forhim. I hope that on the basis of my explanations, my hon. Friends, andhon.

Amendment No. 71 would ensure that there is no de minimis size ofland resulting in land being nibbled away. It would also impose a timeconstraint restricting the degree to which land can be released insuccessive periods, so that we do not see it gone beforelong.</div> <a name="060425125000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.72 is straightforward. It would make it clear that it is wrong toprovide a piece of so-called open space as an alternative to theconstituted village green or common land. I am sure that that ruse hasbeen played on all hon. Members: someone offers the village what wasalready a piece of open space on the grounds that it is secured forever and a day, when the village is losing a piece of common land thatis just as valuable or even more valuable. I hope that that amendmentis clear.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="060425125000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly want theMinister to respond to amendment No. 70. It would guarantee that avoluntary exchange of common land or a village green would be subjectto the same test as compulsorily purchased land.

It is very clear, and I knowthat the Minister will be dying to accept theamendments.</div><a name="060425125000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000209"></a><b class="B">Mr.Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): We, too,support the amendments. Village and town greens are precious to thosecommunities able to enjoy them. We know of many towns and villages thatwould like to have a village green for all the benefits that accruefrom them but do not have one. We often see encroachment on thoseprecious areas of land, sometimes in small bites. Theamendments&#146; strength is that they address that. The loss of avery small piece of a green is an important matter for thecommunity.</div> <a name="060425125000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.Members who tabled the amendments have made their points, so I will notrepeat them, but it is up to the Minister to respond to the amendmentsas positively as he can. The communities affected by such problemswould hold him in the highest esteem if he let his defences down ashade and let somebody slip the quicker ball through and get aresult.</div><a name="060425125000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000210"></a>TheParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and RuralAffairs (Jim Knight):</b> I recall that during debates on theNatural Environment and Rural Communities Bill the hon.

Friends. I said that I always pay close attentionto my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping); I try to dothe same for my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) as well,although sometimes he does not make that as easy. My hon. Friends makeimportant points and I support the intentions behind their amendments.</div><a name="060425125000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I shallresist the amendments. Clause 16 strikes the right balance forflexibility, and I shall take time to persuade my hon. Friends and thehon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) that we have gotit right. If the proposed release land has an area of more than 200 sqm, replacement land must be offered&#151;no ifs or buts. That isclear. It would apply whenever release land had an area greater than,say, 20 m by 10 m. However, I know that my hon. Friends and the hon.Gentleman are concerned that small areas of land would be eaten away.They want to prevent nibbling, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroudput it.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="060425125000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could the status of smaller areas of land be swept away as unimportant? Far from it. Unless the applicant proposes replacement land, there is an absolute duty on the national authority, under subsection (7), to have particular regard to the extent to which the absence of replacement land would be prejudicial to any of the interests in the land. The authority must think about the property rights of the commoners or others, the interestsof the neighbourhood and the public interest in all senses of thephrase, including nature conservation, landscape conservation,protection of public rights of access and protection of archaeological remains or other historic features.</div><a name="060425125000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">That list is prettyformidable. In the vast majority of cases, when the area of proposedrelease land is less than 200 sq m, replacement land of a comparablesize or quality will need to be provided if the proposal is to beapproved. A case of deregistration without exchange being approvedwould be truly exceptional, but we do not want to rule out thepossibility.</div><a name="060425125000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shallgive an example. Suppose an area of common or green were landlocked byhouses and no land nearby could be used as replacement land. Let ussuppose that there was a proposal to take a very small proportion ofthe land to facilitate, shall we say, disabled access to some adjoiningcommunity facility, and that that proposal was supported overwhelminglyby local people because it really made sense. Although such a casewould be exceptional, we would not want it to be impossible for us toapprove that application because of what was instatute.</div><a name="060425125000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">What of theother issues raised by the amendments? Should there be a requirement orstatutory expectation that replacement land should be at least as largeas the release land, or equally advantageous to the various users ofit? We do not think so, for the same reason. Of course, it would beexceptional for the replacement land to be smaller, but we do not wantto rule out the possibility altogether. Such a proposal could provide abetter deal for the commoners and the public. Perhaps the release landwould be inaccessible and remote, while the slightly smallerreplacement land was on people&#146;s doorstep, but had not hithertobeen available to them. In such circumstances, we should not be forcedto turn down an application because ofstatutes.</div><a name="060425125000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We resistthe &#147;equally advantageous&#148; formulation simply because itcould well be interpreted as meaning that the replacement land had tobe equally advantageous in respect of every one of the interests setout in clause 16(6), which is a much extended list of the issues towhich the national authority must have regard when an exchange isproposed. Currently, the national authority is concerned only withwhether an exchange is fair to the private interests involved;subsection (6) would also include the public interest.</div><a name="060425125000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member forStroud mentioned the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. He was right to saythat in the case he mentioned replacement land due to a compulsorypurchase order would have to be equally advantageous to any commoners,other legal right holders and the public. This is the closestcomparable example. However, the deregistration and exchange provisionsin clause 16 involve considering the impact of proposals on a far widerset of interests than even those in that legislation, includingthe</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="060425125000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;interests of theneighbourhood...nature conservation...the conservation of thelandscape...the protection of public rights of access...andthe protection of archeological remains and features of historicinterest.&#148;</div> <a name="060425125000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is adifference, and there would be a potential legal problem if we were toopen up the possibility that all those interests must be equally servedby the exchange land.</div><a name="060425125000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000211"></a>Mr.Drew:</b> I am very pleased that subsection (8) defines thepublic interest. The problem is that we do not define what we mean bythe &#147;interests of the neighbourhood&#148; and how that wouldbe reflected. With the best will in the world, that is where theconflict is most likely to occur. For example, a group of people mightsee the exchange as somewhat less advantageous, but the landowner andperhaps a larger authority, which could have already granted planningpermission, might say, &#147;We think this should take place&#148;.How do we measure those conflicting interests? Perhaps that issueshould be taken on board.</div><a name="060425125000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000212"></a>JimKnight:</b> My hon.

Now, thankgoodness, as a result of the intervention of the Welsh Assembly, it isbecoming a dualled road, but land has been taken up to achieve that.Commoners are not happy that some of the land offered to them has beendistant from where they exercise their rights at the moment; indeed,sometimes it has been on the wrong side of the road, so tospeak.</div><a name="060425125000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like,in clause 16 or clause 17, a commitment that when that exchange ismade, people with rights on the common can continue to exercise thoserights easily, and do not have to go to exceptional lengths to do so.

Mr. Pumfrey, who isobviously a learned gentleman, has corresponded with us all at greatlength, and he has been challenging officials about the situation. <div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>Therefore, I have tabled amendment No. 64, which has been drafted by Mr.Pumfrey. After reading it a few times, one realises that it does meansomething. It is, I am afraid, the language of law as we used tounderstand it, rather than the rather simple language in which I tendto draft my own amendments so that I can understand them.</div><a name="060425125000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle of the amendmentapplies where there is a piece of common land created by some otherstatute prior to 1965 and someone, in the phrase of the amendment, byinadvertent non-compliance forgot or omitted to register it under theCommons Registration Act 1965. There is a concern that that land wouldbe lost. The amendment would add to the facility for correction inclause 19 the opportunity to correct that sort of situation. I will notdetain the Committee by reading out what the Minister&#146;sofficials have said to Mr. Pumfrey&#151;no doubt the Minister will dothat himself, in so many words, in a few minutes.</div><a name="060425125000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an important pointhere, and I hope that the Minister will address it. What is the statusof a piece of land that was common by some other statute prior to 1965,but for whatever reason, was not registered? I am sure that allCommittee members would agree that it would be a great pity if thatland were lost as common land. I am looking for some explanation orreassurance from the Minister as to how that land can be kept as commonland if clause 19 is not amended in the way we propose. I look forwardto the Minister&#146;sresponse.</div><a name="060425125000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">AmendmentsNos. 48 and 49 are far more straightforward and simple because Idrafted them myself, and I am a simple man. They return to the issuethat I raised on Second Reading, and the Minister replied to myconcerns to some degree at that time. I make no apology for returningto these issues because they are very important, and fair play andjustice demand that we should examine them further.</div><a name="060425125000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that there isany real dispute about the fact that after 1965, a large number ofrights were registered that had no true validity in historical terms.They were considerably in excess of rights that people had previouslyexercised under the old levancy and couchancy rules, which weredesigned to relate a person&#146;s common rights to the amount ofstock they could accommodate on their own land during the winterperiod. There were absurd situations where people who could accommodate10 or 20 head of stock during the winter on their own land wereregistering rights for several times that figure during the summer.That aspect is part of the picture.</div><a name="060425125000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also examples, and Ireferred to one from my constituency&#151;needless to say, my localpress have tried to investigate this, but I have not given them anyfurther knowledge&#151;concerning an allegation that someone hadregistered rights when he had no rights on the common prior to thatdebate at all. They were registered, and there have been no grounds forcorrection. Amendment No. 48 would simply delete from clause 19 thesentence that would prevent a correction being made if it had anyimpact on the right of common.</div><a name="060425125000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 49, on which Iam happy to take guidance if the drafting of the precise terminology isincorrect, creates the opportunity in what is intentionally a fairlynarrow situation for correction where entries have been made thatresulted from fraud. <div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>The Minister may ask how we could prove fraud and it would be for othersto come forward with the evidence to prove that someone who had claimedthe right had no justification for doing so. By using the word&#147;fraudulent&#148; in the amendment I have tried to narrow downsituations when countless people could say that this or that was notquite right. I understand the Government&#146;s desire not to reopenthe registration issue because it is a can of worms and my right hon.Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) told usthis morning what his officials said to him when he was the Ministerresponsible for such matters. It is not something to be entered intolightly. Nevertheless, there is a fundamental problem and fair playrequires that it should be addressed. The Government should not simplyshrug their shoulders and pretend that it is too difficult to deal withbecause that would do no one anyjustice.</div><a name="060425125000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his replyto my Second Reading comments the Minister referred to stakeholders andthe National Farmers Union. It is true that the NFU is not in favour ofreopening the register, probably because a number of its members mightbe affected, but it is not true that it would apply to allstakeholders. The Country Land and Business Association, which I quotedearlier, is in favour and said so in its submission to the Committee.It is not a universal view among stakeholders that the matter shouldnot bereopened.</div><a name="060425125000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is acase. I do not have the optimism of the hon. Member for Brecon andRadnorshire that a few charming words will convert the Ministerovernight, but then I am not as gullible as most Liberal Democrats.Nevertheless, I have made the point and I hope that the Ministerunderstands that there are some serious injustices, with ongoingimplications for management. For example, if all but one of the rightsholders of a common accurately registered the rights to which they wereentitled, but one massively over-registered, that could result inover-grazing, which the Bill is, in part, designed to address. If thereis no power to correct that registration, the consequences ofover-grazing and the management decisions that would have to be made,subject to later provisions in the Bill, would affect all rightsholders. They would all suffer because one person massivelyover-registered. That serious injustice should be addressed and that iswhat is behind theamendments.</div><a name="060425125000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000220"></a>PaddyTipping:</b> I want to build on the point that the hon.Gentleman made that the registration process was flawed and that therewas injustice. I have no doubt about that. I would have liked to see abolder approach but clause 19 allows only minor corrections. Largeparcels of land throughout the country should have been registered buthave been left out. That is an injustice initself.</div><a name="060425125000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want todraw the attention of the Minister and his officials&#151;I know thatthey have been to Cumbria frequently to survey the scenethere&#151;to an example that was provided to me by that excellentorganisation, the Friends of the Lake District, which worked extremelyhard in the other place to modify the Bill and has been involved in theissue of commonholders associations and how they are developed. Theydrew my attention to a piece of land at Thirlmere, some of which hasbeen registered as common land. Under the <div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>registration process the open fell was registered as common land, butsome of the common land, which was part of the landscape adjacent toit, had been planted and forested, so during the registration processit was not included on the register. There are strong feelings aboutthat. Forested land does not necessarily always remain forested. I ampleased with some of the Forestry Commission&#146;s work to removewoodland and return landscape to its nativehabitat.</div><a name="060425125000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30pm</div><a name="060425125000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it stands,clause 19(2)(b)(i) does not allow the amount of the land to beincreased at all. I followthe hon. Member for South-EastCambridgeshire(Mr. Paice) on this point. My amendment issimple;it would strike out that possibility and allow theregistration authority to increase the amount of common land. I knowthat this is a radical amendment to clause 19, which just allows forminor correction. Sometimes, amendments are called probing amendments,but I want to use mine as a prodding amendment to remind the Ministerand the people who follow our debate that injustices have been done inthe past and that land that should have been registered&#151;it hadall the attributes for registration&#151;should have beenincluded.</div><a name="060425125000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wouldlike to see a greater proportion of common land and common rightsacross the country. The Bill is currently designed to minimise that.Rather than probe the Minister, I want to prod him and remind him ofthe heritage and tradition in thisrespect.</div><a name="060425125000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000221"></a><b class="B">DavidMaclean</b> (Penrith and The Border) (Con): I support theprinciple of the amendment moved bymy hon. Friend the Memberfor South-East Cambridgeshire. I have not had the privilege of massivecorrespondence from William Pumfrey, MA Cantab., so I do not wish tosupport the exact wording of his amendment. However, I hope that theMinister considers whether on Report we might get an all-partyamendment to clause 19(3). It refers to two reasons why the registermay be corrected when itsays:</div><a name="060425125000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Referencesin this section to a mistakeinclude&#151;</div><a name="060425125000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) amistaken omission;and</div><a name="060425125000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) un unclear orambiguousdescription.&#148;</div><a name="060425125000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hopethat the Minister will say that he will add corrections to the 1965Act, because there are a large number of small but important injusticesarising from it. We cannot have the explanation that the 1965 Act wasdefinitive, is set in stone and can never be changedagain.</div><a name="060425125000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Ministerhas the privilege of being on an extraordinary Committee. When I was aHome Office Minister and passed many wonderful bits of legislation, theoldest Act that I ever managed to amend was something relating to the18th century. If colleagues turn to pages 44 and 45 of theBill&#151;sexy schedule 6, which deals with repeals andamendments&#151;they will see at the bottom of page 45 that theMinister is repealing the whole of the Commons Act 1285. I suspect thatthat sets a ministerial precedent in Committee: no one has ever amendedsuch an ancient Act. If the 1285 Act, which <div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>was set in concrete or granite for eight centuries, can be repealed bythe Minister, I am sure that a few tweaks to the 1965 Act may beappropriate.</div><a name="060425125000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lookingat the other Acts that are being amended&#151;including the repeal ofsection 21 of the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866 and section 2 of theGifts for Churches Act 1811&#151;I do not think that the Ministercould say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, we can&#146;t touch the 1965Act. It was the definitive Act, the bible of commonslegislation.&#148; We know that mistakes have been made.</div><a name="060425125000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Sherwoodis right to quote some examples in Cumbria. There are numerous otherexamples. It is not a mega, mega injustice; it is not that all the 1965Act is invalidated, but mistakes were made in all innocence andhonesty. We should have the ability now, after due process, to correctthem, not by arbitrary changing of the register but by going throughthe various processes in the Act and correcting registration mistakesmade in 1965.</div><a name="060425125000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I donot believe that the Minister can say that clause 19(3) deals with thatissue. I hope that he will accept an amendment on Report thatspecifically mentions the 1965 Act in much simpler language than in theesteemed William Pumfrey&#146;s amendment, and then we can deal withinjustices done in1965.</div><a name="060425125000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I agreeentirely with what has just been said. Years ago, I used to practisethe area of law under the 1965 Act, and I came across mistakes time andagain&#151;not of my own doing, I hasten to say. I would often findthat rights had been registered throughout southern Gwynedd by a wellheeled landowner from 100 miles away. To correct those mistakes, thosewho were suffering as a direct result would have to go to the HighCourt. That was the greatest mistake in thatAct.</div><a name="060425125000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard inprevious discussions that the 1965 Act was flawed. By and large, it wasnot a bad Act. It was a bit too complicated in parts, but the bigmistake was that it was left to those who were suffering to try tocorrect entries that were patently wrong for whatever reason, whetherby mistake or fraud. They would go to the registration authority, but,ultimately, the answer would be, &#147;Take it to the HighCourt.&#148; Tenant farmers from north Wales could not even considerthat, despite the rights being an integral part of their farmingoperation.</div><a name="060425125000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Imentioned in last week&#146;s debate that I hoped that the Bill wouldallow for those corrections to be made without reference to litigation,as has just been suggested by the right hon. Gentleman. I did not get afull response at that stage&#151;nor, to be fair, was I expectingone&#151;but it will be a grave omission in this Bill if we do not atleast open the door to resolving the most blatant of the mistakesand/or wrong registrations of the past. As he said, we are not talkingabout root-and-branch repeal of the 1965 Act, but merely of an avenueto correct what needs to becorrected.</div><a name="060425125000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put thisas strongly as I can. It is clear that these things must be corrected.There are numerous examples in my own vicinity of people who aresuffering as a direct result of wrong registrations and who feel thatthe value of their registration rights has been undermined. Worse stillare those cases that, <div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>strictly speaking, involve not an absentee landlord but someone from afarm who might have registered 10 times as much land as he was entitledto, and whose over-grazing is directly causing difficulties in the mostpersonal way to those small tenant farmers who rely on that grazingland in the spring and summer. In terms of the environment, we are allaffected, because even if the tenant farmers send up fewer sheep thanthey should, they find that most of the pasture has been taken over bythe stock of the wrongly registered dominant tenement. Therefore, interms of the environment and justice and to get the Bill right, I urgethe Minister to accept the course that has been suggested to him. Icertainly would join on an all-party basis to correct this omission inthe Bill.</div><a name="060425125000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I dare saythat none of us were in Parliament when the 1965 Act was passed. I donot know how the omissions got into that Act, but, here and now, we arecreating law and are capable of correcting the omissions. We should dothat, as we have to consider all eventualities to make good law. I amnot saying for one moment that there will be an awful flood ofcorrections, but there will be several of them. There is the Cumbrianexperience, and I have spoken briefly about north Wales, mid-Wales andother places. Undoubtedly, corrections will have to be made, but theregistration authority will be able to look carefully at each and everyone, and I hope that eventually the situation will be dulycorrected.</div><a name="060425125000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)(b)(i) says ineffect that the commons registration authority may not amend itsregister if it will in any way affect</div><a name="060425125000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the extent of any landregistered as common land or as a town or villagegreen&#148;.</div><a name="060425125000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">By that, I readthat the only way in which an amendment can be made is, again, withreference to the High Court. Again, that is a mistake. If the matter islive and the extent of any land registered as common land or villagegreen is genuinely an issue, we should consider a means of dealing withit, rather than rely on the High Court every time.</div><a name="060425125000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a lawyer, I know thatmaking an application to the High Court does not come cheap. I hopethat I shall not be struck off for saying that but, on a serious point,it is no use saying to people, &#147;You can always take thatavenue.&#148; It is available to only a few. If we are legislatingproperly, we must legislate for everyone and all eventualities. If myreading is correct, must reference be made to the High Court? I thinkthat I am right, but I may be wrong. No doubt, the Minister will put meright if necessary.</div><a name="060425125000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000223"></a><b class="B">Mr.Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I support the tenor of theamendments. I have a couple of observations that I do not think otherhon. Members have made. On Second Reading, I referred to the registrarin Shropshire who told me that he thinks there is as much unregisteredas registered common land. The prospect of mistakes remains, and aflexible system that, without the necessity of approaching the HighCourt, allows errors and omissions to be corrected makes eminentsense.</div> <a name="060425125000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologisefor referring to my previous remarks, but the issue was brought home tome by the consequences of the mapping exercise that the Department is <div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>undertaking through the Rural Payments Agency. Most farms have been toldthat the maps that they have supplied are incorrect. It is highlylikely that the maps covering common lands will not conform to theDepartment&#146;s expectations, and as a result of more detaileddigitised mapping, a number of errors are likely to arise in existingregistered common land. From a practical perspective, it is importantthat there is an opportunity to make corrections to the registeredcommon land boundaries.</div><a name="060425125000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point, which is aboutfraudulent rights, also picks up on one of the consequences of thesingle farm payment scheme that we in England are obliged to undertake.Wales is relieved of it. All parties with a claim to a piece of landmust agree about each other&#146;s claims before the Rural PaymentsAgency will sanction payment&#151;when it eventually gets round tomaking payments. As a result of the multiplicity of claims to commonland, if somebody has fraudulently claimed a right or they believe thatthey have a right, they can frustrate payment of claims to those whohave entitlements not only to common land, but to their entire holding.They can potentially frustrate the payment of a large number of singlefarm payments. A flexible system that allows for corrections to bedealt with expeditiously isimportant.</div><a name="060425125000185"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45pm</div><a name="060425125000094"></a></td></tr></table><a name="end"><table width=90%><tr valign=top><td colspan=2>&nbsp;<br><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st060425/pm/60425s03.htm"/>
