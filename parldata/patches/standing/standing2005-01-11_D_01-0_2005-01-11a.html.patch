-<b>“Mr. Heath:</b> As the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) said, this is a core issue of the Bill, and a core area of potential division between Opposition Members and the Government.  As the Minister will be aware, there is serious concern outside this Committee, within the ranks of the police service, about the consequences of what is proposed.  Anyone who has had any dealings with the police at any operational level fully understands the importance attached to the office of constable.”

 <p>We do not need to take an overdose of constitutionality to understand that this is considered to be of paramount importance in understanding the role and functions of the police officer. The office of constable, as an officer of the Crown, carries with it status, duties, responsibilities and protections. Those are protections from inappropriate influence; an awareness that as an officer of the Crown, an officer is doing his or her duty to the best of their abilities and cannot be manipulated in ways that are incompatible with the office of constable.
