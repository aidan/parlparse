 <B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman is saying in his own little way, ''These principles are right, fair, decent and just in so far as we, the Labour party, with an enormous majority in Parliament have decided to apply them to hunting with hounds.'' He is saying ''We, because of our large majority, have chosen to apply these principles comparing utility and suffering to hunting with hounds because we believe it to be a bad thing to have people in red coats, horses, toffs and all that''—all the old arguments. He is saying, ''Because we have a large majority in Parliament and we believe that many of our voters support coarse fishing, we will not allow the same principles to be applied to coarse fishing. The RSPCA can say that, the League Against Cruel Sports can say that, all kinds of people out there can say things but, because we have a large majority in Parliament and because we believe that coarse fishing is a good thing, we do not intend to pay any attention to them.''<P>
 That may be the case with regard to this Parliament and to the Labour party. Indeed, the Minister reminds us that it is a Labour party manifesto commitment not to do anything about shooting or fishing. I accept that entirely. None the less, the logic of accepting the principles of utility and cruelty in sequential tests and the logic of the definition of cruelty laid down in the Bill is that those principles should in future be applied to other sports, and to dog and horse racing as well. If they were not, the Government would come under increasing pressure so to apply them.

 <B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Member for Worcester is a coarse fisherman. I had better give way to him.<P>
-<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman refers to the Labour Government driving this issue through with their big majority in Parliament. Can he confirm that for every vote that has taken place since 1987 on this issue, on the basis of a free vote, it is Parliament as a whole that has spoken and not the Government party driving the issue forward?<P>

 <B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman made an interesting slip. He asked whether I would accept that it is the Government as a whole who have driven this issue. What he meant, if he will forgive me for picking him up, was that it is the House of Commons as a whole, not the Government as a whole, that has driven it through. [Interruption.] No. The hon. Gentleman said ''It is the Government as a whole who have driven this through'', which was an interesting slip of the tongue.<P>
 <B>Mr. Foster:</B> I know that the standard has not been too good in this Room of late, but clearly the hon. Gentleman completely misheard what I said. I said that it was not the Government who have driven through this issue but Parliament as a whole. The Committee has been enjoined to have a free vote. If the hon. Gentleman does not understand that, heaven help us.<P>
 <B>Mr. Gray:</B> It has not been Parliament as a whole, because the House of Lords has not driven this issue <p>
