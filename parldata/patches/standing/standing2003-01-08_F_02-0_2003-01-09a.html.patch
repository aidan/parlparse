 <B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman often speaks as if he is the only Member of Parliament who represents farmers. I am proud of the fact that I represent a large number of farmers. I do not represent hunters; I represent a large number of dairy farmers. North Wiltshire is the centre of the dairy industry in England. The hon. Gentleman need take no high moral stance. He is right that by no means all farmers use hounds to kill foxes, or allow the hunt on to the land to kill foxes. By no means do all farmers use shooting to kill foxes. He describes them as being bloody minded. If I were a farmer and my livelihood were disappearing—under the gentle care of the Minister and the Under-Secretary it is pretty poor at the moment—and my lambs, sheep and calves were predated on by foxes—[Hon. Members: ''Calves?''] Yes. There is plenty of evidence of predation on calves.<P>
 <B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I really cannot hear the hon. Gentleman speaking with this persistent banter. I ask hon. Members to give him an opportunity to speak. If they wish to intervene, I am sure that he would be prepared to allow them to do so.<P>
 <B>Mr. Gray:</B> Perhaps hon. Members are right and we should talk of more modest farms. Mrs. Cara Voelcker of Avil's farmhouse, one of the largest egg producers in the UK, is in my constituency. Her chickens are largely free range, and it is a large, important and very successful operation. She told me that eight foxes were shot the previous week, but there were 12 more predating on her chickens. Finding a way of getting rid of foxes is important if one wants free range, high quality, barn-raised chickens. Her difficulty is that because the farm is right on the M4—near to where the Solicitor-General was stopped yesterday for going at 99 mph—the hunt cannot get there and she has to shoot them.<P>

 <B>Mr. Gray:</B> The evidence I suspect is slight. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point in picking me up on that. I will investigate whether there is any evidence, but I accept the hon. Gentleman's gracious and courteous correction of my slip. I hope that he will forgive me if I do not produce such evidence. There is no doubt, however, about fox predation on lambs, or chicken operations such as the one that I described in my constituency.<P>
