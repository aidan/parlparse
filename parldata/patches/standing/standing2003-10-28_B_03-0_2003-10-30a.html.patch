 Amendment No. 47 is a probing amendment that would leave out clause 1(5)(b), which excludes from consideration any region containing Gibraltar. We must assume that that is likely to be the south-west region, because it has been recommended in proposals. Advocating such a move when we first discussed the matter about five years ago, I suggested that Gibraltar might form part of the western approaches. As it had some similarities to Devonport in the south-west, it might be appropriate to put it there. I cannot understand—

 I cannot understand why the presence of Gibraltar should be a bar to participation in the system for postal ballots. It is an important place, and it is extremely important that it was finally enfranchised, but it is a relatively small community with an electorate that is smaller than the constituency of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), but about the same size as my town, Frome.
 <P>
 The Minister must explain the force majeure that prevents the south-west region—if that is where Gibraltar appears—from being entertained as a possibility for a pilot postal ballot. The postal services in Gibraltar are just as good, if not better, than our own. Why should it be specifically excluded?
 <P>
-<B>Mr. Hawkins<?h -.001pt>:</B><roman> I want to make two points. As the hon. Gentleman knows, those on the Opposition Benches have been united in pressing the Government to include Gibraltar in the European elections. The original undertaking by the then Minister was given to me about two years ago when I had a similar shadow role to my current one. The hon. Gentleman will recognise, because a number of his hon. Friends went to Gibraltar for its national day, as I did to represent my party, that the one place where one will be able to guarantee an incredibly high turnout in European elections is Gibraltar. Because of the fact that there is no democratic deficit there and the Gibraltarian people hugely value the opportunity to vote in person, I suspect that the Government believe—rightly in my view—that Gibraltar will have to be an area in which everyone is allowed to vote in person.<P>
-<B>Mr. Heath<?h -.001pt>:</B><roman> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I honestly do not believe that that argument washes. There must be a better reason than that. If there is a propensity to vote already, there is nothing in particular to be gained by changing the system, but no one is suggesting that the postal voting system is inherently worse than voting in person. If it is sensible to hold pilots anywhere—the assumption is that if the pilots are successful they will be extended to the whole country, including Gibraltar in due course—there is no specific reason why Gibraltar should be excluded, and with it the whole south-west region. The idea that any particular circumstances that pertain to the 30,000 or <!69>so population of Gibraltar should preclude the 5 million or 6 million inhabitants of south-west England from participating in the scheme, if it is a good one, seems slightly odd.<P>

They have a huge tradition of voting in person; the last two referendums in Gibraltar organised by the Chief Minister Peter Caruana have had turnouts of more than 90 per cent., including the last one of 97 per cent. when rejecting the Labour Government's plans to try to do a disreputable deal with Spain.

 Postal votes are either a good thing or a bad thing. If they are a good thing, it seems very odd to consider one small part of the total electorate to be absolutely sacrosanct and not to be given the opportunity to participate in that way. That does not make sense. I want the Minister to explain clearly why this paragraph is in the Bill. What is there about the region that happens to include Gibraltar that makes it absolutely impossible to hold postal elections there, when that is clearly possible in every other part of the United Kingdom barring London, where the prohibiting factor is the mayoral election and Northern Ireland, where it is understood that there is a different electoral arrangement?

 I want to start with the issue of Gibraltar, about which I twice intervened on the hon. Gentleman. He mentioned that he has been to Gibraltar, perfectly properly, in response to my interventions. I am delighted to hear that. He makes it clear that he went at his own expense, not at the expense of the Gibraltar Government. I think that I was right in understanding that he has not been there for its national day. I have had the opportunity to be with the people of Gibraltar on their national day. On one occasion—maybe on both—the Liberal Democrats were represented by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who has just stepped down from his post as Liberal Democrat spokesman on home affairs.
 <P>
 The people of Gibraltar who heard the hon. Gentleman put forward his party's views will be very disappointed when they read<I> Hansard,</I> as they undoubtedly will. Like so many people in the UK's overseas territories, they take Parliament very seriously when anyone from any party speaks about issues that relate to them. Whenever I make speeches about St. Helena, I get letters from people who live there or have been there. That is also the case when I speak about Gibraltar or Zimbabwe. In any of the countries that have political issues the people read carefully what is said in<I> Hansard</I>. I think that they will be disappointed to hear that the Liberal Democrat official stance is that it does not matter if the Gibraltarian people are denied the opportunity to vote in person. The attitude of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is that it does not matter if the vote is all postal there.

 Liberal Democrat amendment No. 47 would leave out the Gibraltar subsection. I repeat that we know that Gibraltarians want to vote in person. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome responded to my intervention by saying, ''We have had postal voting for a long time. It is just as good as voting in person.'' The Gibraltarians will not accept that. They want to vote, and Gibraltar is a relatively small place, so it is easy for them to get to the polling station and cast their votes in person. If I can arrange it at my own expense, I look forward to going over to Gibraltar on the day of the next European elections to watch the Gibraltarians vote in person.

 For the people of Gibraltar, there is a big difference between voting in person and voting by post, but given the incredibly high turnout in the Gibraltar referendum, I do not think that Gibraltarians want to vote by post.
 <P>
 As my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson) said on Second Reading, once we increase the opportunity for electors on the UK mainland to vote by post whenever they want to, which is a welcome change that has already been introduced, we do not need to run the risk of using unsafe postal votes, as proposed in the legislation. My hon. Friend said that postal votes are easier to obtain than they used to be, and it is now possible for anybody to apply for a permanent postal vote to vote in any election. That is probably as far as most of my colleagues want to go. I have spoken to several of them about it.

 Amendment No. 1 raises a completely different point, which I know will hugely aggravate real activists on the Government Back Benches such as the hon.

 My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham and I feel that Scotland should be left out because it is not practical for an individual to deliver a last-minute postal ballot in person to a returning officer in that region, which has many rural and island communities. To ensure equality of opportunity for last-minute votes, the receptacles for such votes would have to be in the same places as polling stations traditionally have been. That would hugely increase the cost of an all-postal ballot for Scotland.
 <P>
 My hon. Friend the Member for Upminster raised a matter the other day about which the Conservatives are absolutely firm. Even if there were an all-postal ballot in an area, any voter who wanted to take their postal ballot on polling day to a place in their constituency should be able to do so. That is absolutely vital, and it would be more difficult in large, sparsely populated areas such as parts of rural and island Scotland.

 My hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Scotland pointed out that personation will become ''ever more prevalent'' with an all-postal ballot. She is especially concerned, as am I, about the impact that that may have on results in the large number of university cities in Scotland. I have a huge regard for the high quality of Scottish universities, and a number of my friends and contemporaries went to Scottish universities.

 If there is any issue about Scottish universities—I do not believe there is—it would apply only in the case of local elections.

 To ensure transparency for the electorate, political parties should be able to monitor all postal ballots throughout the election. All political parties should be furnished with a daily marked register from the first returns of the postal ballot until polling day, which is anticipated to be 10 June. That would ensure a proper democratic check on the progress of the election. We will return to some of these issues later, but I hope that the Minister can give us an undertaking today that the Government will table amendments to guarantee a daily marked register, not only for Scotland but for any other region that might be chosen. We might then be able to take a different view of some of these issues when we come to them.
 <P>
 These are the concerns of my hon. Friends with a particular responsibility for Scotland. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor) comes from Scotland but has an English seat. He used to represent a Scottish constituency, with great distinction, and is also a former shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. He may want to expand on that, but I reassure him that there is no division between us. I cast no slurs on Scottish or English students at Scottish universities. My hon. Friend mentioned St. Andrews. My PA, who runs my office, comes from St. Andrews and is a Scot, although she happens to be mayoress of the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea this year. I hope that that shows that our party welcomes involvement from all areas, but I want to press the Minister to give us some indications about Scotland.

 My point has already been touched on by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and I made several interventions about it on my hon. Friend the Minister on Second Reading. We all accept that Gibraltar is likely to be included in the south-west region, but why does that automatically preclude that region from being treated as a pilot? I feel strongly about that, as I said on Second Reading, because my area has had a pilot for increased postal voting and the use of electronic means of voting. I accept that we have to have experimentation to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the different methods of voting, but once an electorate has been given more access to voting by different means, it is always much more difficult to take that away again.
 <P>
 Notwithstanding the problems that there will be by the nature of things—if we are going to widen the pilot schemes and have pilots all over the country, unless we include the whole country some areas will have that advantage taken away—I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to ask the Electoral Commission to ensure that some analysis is done of the implications where people have had their electoral opportunities narrowed. There may be problems once people have been given different means of voting, if they then have to return to more traditional means at the next election, notwithstanding that they may still be able to get a postal vote. My experience of the electorate—without being in any way pejorative—is that people get used to a particular system of voting and take it as read that that is what will happen from then on.

 If the Minister will assure me that he will contact the Electoral Commission to consider what will happen in relation to the non-continuity of the pilot, I have no reason not to support the Government on this clause.

 I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said about amendment No. 45 and agree that there are issues. My major concern is that, by allowing an all-postal vote in one electoral region, the Bill will exclude the electorate in that region from the last week of a UK-wide campaign. That will mean that parties and candidates in regions that use all-postal votes will not have the opportunity to employ the same timetable for the election campaign. Being in an all-postal region will also distort and alter the experience of electors. They will experience a different type of campaign—certainly through the media. We all know that, during election campaigns, everything starts to heat up towards the last week. Someone in an electoral region with an all-postal vote will not be exposed to that part of the campaign and might miss out on some vital details.
 <P>
 Those things have to be balanced with the desire to have effective control. The pilot is an experiment and we have to assess whether it will work properly and whether all-postal votes work. We can assess that only if we have controls. That is why there must be a combination of all-postal ballots and traditional ballots through the ballot box. On balance, I would opt for ensuring that we have specific regions for the pilots.<P>

 There is a degree of paranoia from the Conservative party about what happens in Scotland, because of its poor electoral performance there. It is now trying to hide that by trying to exclude an area of the UK from a pilot that would show it up in an even worse light. That is despicable.

 I have been to one of Gibraltar's independence day rallies, and they are wonderful examples of democracy. If one were to read out the telephone book, they would cheer from end to end.

I do not mind paying that because it is very nice coffee, but if a pile of MPs take three cups of coffee at state expense, it is upsetting.

I do not want to cause a party dispute today after all we had yesterday, but we cannot have such vicious and spiteful attacks on the Scots.

I hope that he will appreciate that if amendment No. 1 were carried, those who already have permission to vote by post under the arrangements that have been made for all elections would still have the opportunity to do so. Amendment No. 1 would not take that away, but would simply stop Scotland from being one of the postal pilot regions. People who have already registered to vote by post for business reasons or whatever could still do so.<P>

+<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Polling stations.<P>
+<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Presumably not to polling stations but to the municipal buildings. We already have postal ballots. Amendment No. 1 in effect provides not only that we should not have a 100 per cent. postal ballot in Scotland, but that we should not allow those people in Scotland who have already applied for postal ballots to have them. Next June, those people will face exactly the problems that the hon. Gentleman suggests. They have to post their ballots anyway. Is he saying that, under amendment No. 1, nobody should be allowed to have a postal ballot?<P>
+<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We may be under a misunderstanding, although of course I defer to the hon. Gentleman's knowledge not only of his own constituency, but of what has happened in Scotland. I freely confess that I do not have a detailed knowledge of what happened in postal pilots in Scotland. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster said, in some of the pilots that have already taken place there was a chance for people who wanted to vote in person on the day to do so, but that was not true of the postal pilot in her constituency. All I say is that whether a pilot takes place in Scotland, England, Wales or wherever, there ought to be a chance for people who want to vote in person on the day to do so. I would not want any of our amendments to go against that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not suggest that amendment No. 1 is designed to do so, because it is not.<P>
+<B>Mr. Harris:</B> I accept that, but the hon. Gentleman mentioned Scotland, England and wherever else, and the effect of amendment No. 1 is to exclude Scotland from the pilot. He is being a bit disingenuous in saying that such arrangements could apply in Scotland, England or anywhere else, as amendment No. 1 would prevent Scotland from taking part in the pilot.<P>
+<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?<P>
+<B>Mr. Harris:</B> I am being far too generous, but of course.<P>

 I do not want to go over the arguments again, but on Second Reading I mentioned Strathclyde's water referendum. A large part of the Strathclyde region is rural, and none of the constituencies there, all of which took part in the ballot, registered a turnout of less than 70 per cent. That included Argyll and Bute, which as the hon. Gentleman knows is a very rural constituency indeed. He mentioned the problem of a postal strike, but, once again, a postal strike could happen next June anyway, and those who have applied for a postal ballot would be similarly affected. We might as well say that weather conditions could intervene on a traditional election, and people could be prevented from driving or walking to the polling station. We cannot account for acts of God or the postal workers' union, but events can derail any election, regardless of how it is carried out. The hon. Gentleman's arguments are not specifically against a postal pilot in Scotland; rather, they seem to be against the very idea of having a 100 per cent. postal ballot at all.
 <P>
 My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland put up a sterling defence of students in relation to electoral fraud, but the hon. Member for Surrey Heath perhaps has a point. There are all sorts of hurdles and questions that have yet to be answered about electoral fraud, and there is a range of mechanisms that will affect the pilots and the future of voting in any system.
 <P>
 What should we do then? Surely the best thing for the Government would be to say, ''Well, let's have a pilot area, or two or three pilot areas. Let's see what the problems are before we decide what the future of the exercise will be.'' The Government have already proposed the mechanism that we could use to identify the very flaws that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath is so concerned about, but he is opposing it.

 I would say the following about amendment No. 1. I always make disclaimers; I explained this morning that I was not a solicitor and that became very obvious. It will now become very obvious that I am English. I am proud of it, and I represent a Middlesex constituency that does not have a university in it, so I approach the issue of Scotland with a little caution. It occurred to me as an Englishman looking at the amendment paper and listening to the debate that the uprising of Scottish Labour Members who denounced what my hon. Friend was proposing—I smelt a bit of a rat—was really all about party politics. The fact that the Labour ranks from Scotland are indignant about what my hon. Friend says suggests to me that the issue is a party one. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland because he went as far as saying just that.

 The hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland put his finger on it. I find myself wondering why the massed ranks of Labour Members should be so politically indignant if there are some reasonable arguments about excluding Scotland. That suggests to me that we might be on to something. They might be petrified that, if we were to exclude Scotland, support for their party in their heartland is so awful that they could no longer rely on people to motivate themselves and get to the polling station. What they are seeking to do in opposing the amendment is unfairly to stack the odds in their favour, to try to find a few remaining supporters.

 As to the question of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Harris) about whether 13 out of 14 would be adequate, if the Electoral Commission's criteria are sensible and proper—I have no reason to doubt that they are—why should we pick and choose? The Electoral Commission was set up to decide what was sensible and has announced it. My comment to the hon. Gentleman is that the situation is an all-or-nothing one.
 <P>
 For heaven's sake, why spend taxpayers' money setting up a commission to do something and then ignore it? That is what seems extraordinary to me. To say, ''Perhaps we can pick and choose,'' is probably worse than ignoring it. It is to say, ''We shall listen, but pay no attention afterwards. We will decide for ourselves.'' I am not sure of the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, but I should be happy as an individual—I do not say this on behalf of my party—to go along with the amendment.
 <P>
 On the other hand, I should not be happy to support amendment No. 45. I spend a lot of time, and I have heard the hon. Gentleman spend some of his time, arguing for sunset clauses. I was rather under the impression that we were legislating for next year's European elections—and that is what we should do. If we were legislating in general terms, it would be sensible to omit the reference to 2004. However, if the intention is, as has been said, to experiment and to pick and choose, I cannot support the idea of using the Bill, which may, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen to be flawed, as a vehicle for all subsequent use of postal ballots. I am more than content to go along with amendment No. 48, but I shall not support amendment No. 45 if the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome presses it to a vote. I believe that we must return to the matter once we have learned.

Friend the Member for Lewisham, East about whether there might be opportunities for more sitting hours or days before Tuesday at 5 pm.<P>
 Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 45, 46 and 48 suggest that regions and nations should be eligible for piloting and that the Electoral Commission's suggestions should, effectively, be the deciding factor as to whether a pilot takes place in a particular region or nation. Obviously, that would fundamentally alter the way in which regions are chosen for piloting.
 <P>
 Electoral Commission expertise can be called on to help to ensure that the selection process is based on impartial advice, but the answer to amendment No. 48 is that Ministers must decide which regions should be chosen for piloting. As they are accountable to Parliament, it is right that they should make pilot decisions and not leave such things to other bodies such as the commission. Of course, the Government will give heavy weight to its advice, but we must always have an eye to the fact that Parliament holds the Executive to account for their decisions.
 <P>
-<B>Mr. Heath<?h -.001pt>:</B><roman> Yes, of course, Ministers make a proposal to the House and it is then for the House to accept or reject it.

 On amendments Nos. 45 and 46, I believe that the next big step in piloting will be the regional level, moving up from the local level but without the ''big bang'' approach of going to the whole country and the potential risks associated with scaling up in such a large single step. Up to three regions would be a fair and good balance in the interim phase.
 <P>
 Hon. Members should be aware that the Electoral Commission is of a mind to recommend that, eventually, we should consider all-postal piloting for all local elections. There is a move towards a wider roll-out. Therefore, it is important that we are pragmatic and reasonable in the way that we scale up our piloting.

 In respect of the amendments about the inclusion of London, the complexity relates to the different electoral systems that are likely to be used. The mayoral election, of course, uses the supplementary voting system. The London Assembly uses an additional member system and the European Parliament uses the closed list system. Those complexities add something that could be too burdensome for the regional returning officer at this early stage if they also have to cope with all-postal balloting. We have adopted our position for that reason alone.

 Amendment No. 1 would exclude Scotland from being a pilot. My hon. Friends, and in particular my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Anniesland and for Glasgow, Cathcart, have raised strong arguments about how irrational and illogical the amendment is. The idea that Scotland would be less capable of running a pilot than any other region is spurious, and the evidence is not particularly strong.

 Amendment No. 20 would exclude two regions with common boundaries. There is no logical or fair reason for that. I heard the comments by the hon.

Even if there were such discontent, it would not be an insurmountable problem. It would be discriminatory to exclude two regions with a common boundary. Boundaries between regions should not be a factor in the success or evaluation of piloting. I hope that my hon. Friends will reject the amendment, and that hon. Members will consider withdrawing it.

 There is still an argument about whether elections in three regions would be better than a UK-wide election. If we had not had the break over lunch, which made me forget my point, I would have used the argument raised by the hon. Member for North Tayside (Pete Wishart), which I also used on Second Reading, which was that a significant problem with part of the country voting on an all-postal basis while other parts vote normally on polling day, is that some people would be excluded from the latter stages of what is a national campaign. Paradoxically, that is an argument for Scotland to be used as a pilot area. Scotland has separate media and political systems, so if it were a pilot area, it would have a campaign that was appropriate to the form of voting, which would not spill over the border. However, I will leave that thought. I am not convinced that we are going down the right road.
 <P>
 I still have not heard a sensible reason why Gibraltar cannot do a postal vote when the rest of the country can. I had hoped to get such a reason from the Minister. He simply said that the Electoral Commission has not done any studies there, but Gibraltar is much like many parts of the UK. The population there are not particularly likely to be unable to cope with a postal voting system. I have great respect for the electorate in Gibraltar. We still do not know—

 When speaking in support of his amendments, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath made some arguments about Scotland that were the most preposterous that I have ever heard in a Committee. The Conservative party has certainly had some difficulties over recent days, and I believe that the hon. Gentleman may be having similar difficulties of his own with a vote of confidence. On one of the amendments, he managed to mislay 33.33 per cent. of the Conservative members present in the Committee, and on another proposition, he lost 66.66 per cent. of his colleagues, who held a different view from his and chose to use their independent judgment. He may therefore need to consult a little more; otherwise, he might find himself on a slippery slope.
 <P>
 I am especially grateful for the very cogent points made by the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East. He obviously understood some of our arguments, and expressed his views extremely well, as always.

 We owe the hon. Member for Chorley a huge debt of gratitude for his contributions to the debate. He mentioned that he had some sort of thermometer device attached to the side of Chorley town hall, which indicated the turnout at any particular moment, rather in the way that churches very often have thermometers to show the progress of their appeal for the church roof. I do not know whether that is a necessary adjunct to a rolling marked register, but it would certainly be a graphic way of illustrating the success or otherwise of the process.

 The hon. Member for Glasgow, Anniesland makes an important point. Obviously some form of electronic marked register is an option. I do not necessarily think that that will be more cumbersome because we are talking about regional elections. The responsibility for the elections will still be at the level of the individual returning officer in the council that is administering the election. I hope that a marked register will be available at that level. We do not want a national marked register, which would be of limited value to any party. We want to know who has voted at local level so that appropriate action can be taken. That seems to be the sensible way forward.
 <P>
 We should not protract the argument, because we are all clear that there are strong grounds for an amendment in favour of a rolling marked register of one form or another. I hope that the Minister can satisfy us on that.

 I am keen to make further progress with the Bill, so I shall not detain the Committee much longer. I agree with the point that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath made on amendment No. 2 about the need for a place where people can personally put their ballot paper into the safe keeping of the returning officer. That is a good safeguard. I cannot relate that to his amendment No. 2 in any way, which is my difficulty. It seems to me that amendment No. 2 would prevent a postal ballot from taking place. I accept that the hon.

 It makes sense to me to provide that information. I am sure that there will not be any insurmountable difficulty as far as electoral law and data protection are concerned. At the moment it is possible to make marked registers available for a one-day election, so I do not see why that should not be possible for a two-day election. Presumably, modern technology makes it possible to do that within the time scale, rather than having a boring paper-and-pencil exercise, which is what seems to happen at the moment. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on amendment No. 50. If Labour Members on the Floor of the House expressed support for that and they are here today, I hope that they will have the courage of their convictions and vote for what they believe to be right, irrespective of what the usual channels might do to people who get up to such antics.
 <P>
 Nevertheless, I am very supportive of amendment No. 2 and I would like to take the matter one stage further. There are some issues beyond those that have been spoken about by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath. It is more than a question of plain English or legal gobbledegook. Subsection 3(a) states that polling may take place on more than one day. I am assuming that that is not meant to cover the point that one can post a postal ballot on any day one likes and it will turn up at the town hall a day or so later—we do that at the moment. We do not need that provision for postal voting as we understand it.

 I want to comment on the need to include in the Bill the requirement for a marked register. There are compelling arguments for it, but I am concerned that it is to be left to the discretion of regional returning officers. We would see different practices in different regions, or even different practices between sub-regional electoral officers in which case we would see different practices within the same region. Given that there are strong arguments for a marked register, the only way to make that clear would be to include such a provision in the Bill.
 <P>
 We did not have a pilot in my constituency, but the electoral officer decided to innovate by sending out applications for postal votes with polling cards. The result was a very high turnout. In one polling district, it was 70 per cent. Obviously, there was no marked register, so it was incredibly difficult to manage the election and people had a surfeit of paper. If we move to all-postal voting, it is essential to make it clear to those involved in the running of the election that a rolling marked register must be available.
 <P>
-<B>Mr. Leslie<?h -.001pt>:</B><roman> These are separate issues. I will deal with amendment No. 2 first. All-postal voting changes the conventions of ordinary polling at polling stations. It changes their fixed hours in one day and how returning officers prevent double voting by keeping a marked register. Postal voting requires the dispatch of ballot papers in time for voters to receive, consider and return them, which is a process that takes more than one day. That is why we have made provision in clause 2(3)(a) to allow the latitude and scope for voting to take place on more than one day. If the whole process of dispatching and returning ballot papers were to take place on one day, it would not allow postal voting to take place. That is the long and the short of it.<P>

 The hon. Member for Surrey Heath asked for reassurance that, on the main polling day, voters could cast or drop off their ballot papers. Where we have all-postal voting, that will be the case. There will be staffed delivery points rather than polling stations and there will obviously be fewer of them. We intend to combine local and European elections on 10 June, which is a Thursday and in line with the British tradition of polling on a Thursday. We cannot be absolutely certain about that date because a European order is required for a window in which to hold the European parliamentary elections. Once we are certain of the date, we will announce it formally.

 The hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) seemed to be under the misapprehension that the subsection on voting on more than one day might somehow lead to polling organisations exploiting an opportunity. I assure him that polling companies are already prevented from publishing exit poll results in advance of the closure of polling by section 66 of Representation of the People Act 1983. That has been the legislation for some time, and I urge the hon. Gentleman to look at it again if he should be approached with early results the next time he visits the polling station that he mentioned.
 <P>
 In respect of amendment No. 50, we now know that it echoes the view of many across the House, including the three main parties and the Scottish National party, that making a marked register available on a rolling day-to-day basis would be preferable, particularly in an all-postal election. I can certainly appreciate and sympathise with the sentiments expressed. Marked registers are a helpful tool, not only for the returning officer, but for campaigning political parties, because they help to prevent voters who have perhaps already voted from being contacted. Marked registers are an ecological measure, in that they prevent wasted paper from going where it should not, and there are many other potential advantages to making them available. They can also prevent double counting and fraud, but there are points on both sides of the argument that need further consideration.

 I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation in relation to our amendment No. 2. There is certainly an issue, particularly in relation to the exit poll to which my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne referred. We might want to return to that. I will go away and look at section 66 of the 1983 Act, to which the Minister helpfully referred. We have seen some of the problems in other countries—albeit countries bigger than the UK. In American elections, polling organisations sometimes start reporting on the way in which people have voted on one side of the country even before the polls have opened on the other side, because of the vast differences in the time zones. That has been thought to influence people's voting behaviour.
 <P>
 My hon. Friend is on to a good point, but we need to consider the current legislation and then reconsider the Minister's explanation of subsection (3)(a) and how it will affect matters, and whether the provision might need amending. I will reserve our position while we go away and do that research, with the help of the Library and others. Perhaps we can return to the issue on Report.

 Even if amendment No. 3 does not appeal to the Government, amendment No. 4 might. I am looking to the Minister for an assurance that he will, at least, consider it as a serious alternative. It might be a genuine improvement to the Bill. I hope that he will consider it in the constructive spirit in which it is intended and that he will at least assure us that he will talk to his officials and advisers and, perhaps, propose a revised version. I do not have huge faith in my precise wording—there might be some defect in the drafting—but if the Minister is prepared to undertake to consider the problem for the reasons that I have indicated, I shall be very grateful. This is a genuine attempt to improve the Bill, as Committees are supposed to do.

 On the point that the hon. Gentleman makes about amendment No. 4, surely we do not expect the Government to prescribe in an order every point of collection throughout all three regions and to determine that from on high. If the Government propose that, we really will be a long time reading the orders. It is a matter for local returning officers to determine the appropriate sites. They are the borough council officials and the district council officials of whom he speaks. They do not need a veto because they will propose the places that satisfy the conditions that the Government will set out in the pilot order.
 <P>
 I cannot support the hon. Gentleman's amendments, which would have a retrograde effect on the Bill.
