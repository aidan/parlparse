 <B>Mr. Borrow:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that following the introduction of the council tax the Government's policy was to ensure that a larger proportion of the revenue spent by local authorities was raised locally? That was a deliberate policy of the then Government to ensure that council tax increased by more than the rate of inflation because they felt that council taxpayers should pay a greater proportion and thereby reduce the gearing effect.<P>
 <B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West, said from a sedentary position, it is raised by the council tax on southern local authorities and spent by inefficient northern authorities. If hon. Members opposite dislike council tax so much, which seems to be the tenor of what they are saying, they have had six long years in which to abolish it and replace it with a different system.<P>
 <B>Mr. Paul Goodman </B>(Wycombe): A poll tax, perhaps.<P>
-<B>Mr. Clifton Brown:</B> I think that the council tax system works quite well but it has been brought into disrepute by the large increases imposed on local authorities by this Government. That is brought about by the system of funding of local authorities. For every three parts paid by central Government from non-domestic rates and the rate support grant, one part is raised locally. Therefore, for every pound that the Government do not give to local authorities they have to raise four pounds from council tax. That is the difficulty that many southern authorities face in setting their budgets. They have two choices: either to cut back services or to increase council tax in double digits to maintain those services.<P>

 It is all very well to say that it is for the local authority's discretion, but the councils forced to impose such great council tax increases are some of the best star-rated authorities under the Government's rating system. There is something wrong somewhere, <p>
