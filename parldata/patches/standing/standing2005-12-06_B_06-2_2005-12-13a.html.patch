-</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align=left><b>Sammy Wilson:</b> I do not want to repeat the points that have been made, but as a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, I raised the issue with the Deputy Chief Constable of the PSNI at last week&#146;s Policing Board meeting. In public session he made it clear that, whatever the Secretary of State may have said on Second Reading and despite the defence that the Minister might mount here tonight, the police believe that this clause will make it virtually impossible for them to secure the necessary evidence to secure a conviction at a tribunal that will result in a licence being imposed.</p><p align=left>The police have painted the following scenario: the historic inquiries team digs up some new evidence, lead or inquiry, and decides to talk to Mr. So-and-so. As soon as the police knock on Mr. So-and-so&#146;s door, Mr. So-and-so is aware that the police are on to him. He knows that the police may wish to talk to him, question him, search his premises and collect fingerprints and other evidence. What does Mr. So-and-so do? He decides, &#147;I&#146;ll stop this whole process. I&#146;ll apply for a certificate of eligibility.&#148; That will prevent the historic inquires team from securing further evidence against him.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> If the hon. Gentleman refers back to clause 3(2), he will see that no one can qualify for the scheme after 1 November 2005. Therefore that provision is already in place.</p><p align=left><b>Sammy Wilson:</b> But the police inquiry could have started long before then. In an historic case, the offence may have occurred a long time ago&#151;but once the police ask someone about a particular crime, that person can immediately put a stop to the inquiry.</p><p align=left>The Minister may say that the police would have to have reasonable grounds for speaking to an individual, so they would already have some evidence. However, last Thursday, in his enthusiasm to tell us why victims should not have any knowledge of certificates of eligibility that have been issued, he pointed out that when someone applies for a certificate and that certificate is granted,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the police may not have sufficient information to charge the person&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>Indeed, he went further:</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 288</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;when a person applies to the certification commissioner, in many cases charges will not have been brought. There may be grounds for arrest, but in some cases there may not even be that.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B, </i>8 December 2005; c. 129.]</ul></p><p align=left>According to the Minister, when a person applies for a certificate, there may not even be grounds for arrest. The police may not have sufficient information to charge the person.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> My hon. Friend will know that under the criteria set down in clause 3(2)(i), at the stage where a certificate of eligibility is being sought the police officer is only required to have &#147;reasonable grounds for suspecting&#148;. No police officer would send a case to the DPP or the special prosecutor if he just had reasonable grounds for suspecting; that is the stage when he would bring somebody in, start his cross-examination and follow up leads. The critical issue will be fingerprints, because those, and the other tests, will tell the police officer not just whether that person is responsible for the crime under review, but whether he was responsible for more up-to-date crimes.</p><p align=left><b>Sammy Wilson:</b> That is exactly the point that the police have been making, and the Minister made the same point in this Committee. When the certificate is being applied for, the police may not have sufficient information to charge a person. The Minister did not want the victims to know about the certificate, because it might be premature. If it is premature&#151;by the Minister&#146;s admission that might be so&#151;how does he expect the police to build the case?</p><p align=left>As the hon. Member for Foyle suggested, is not the true intent of the Bill to make it impossible for a case to be built against the person? The Bill is weighed against the victim and in favour of the defendant, and that may suit the Government in many cases. It will certainly suit the people who wanted the Bill in the first place to make it as difficult as possible to get convictions&#151;and on the Minister&#146;s own admission, and on the evidence that the police have put forward and the points that they have made, it is clear that that will be the outcome.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> I refute the suggestion made by the hon. Member for East Antrim that the Government do not wish to seek convictions under the scheme. If that were so, it would have been easy to design the scheme differently to make sure that that outcome was achieved. The Government have designed it to ensure that there is accountability, potential convictions if people are found guilty of charges, and a release on licence. The clause 7 exemptions are key elements in the scheme and reflect the 2003 proposals in detail; they allow the certificate holder to return to Northern Ireland without risking arrest, being questioned, or otherwise, by the police.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> Will the Minister explain how that reflects in detail the 2003 proposals?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> The clause 7 exemptions are included in the 2003 proposals.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 289</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> I have checked the proposals that were published in the annexe to the joint declaration at Hillsborough in 2003, but I cannot see spelled out in detail the restrictions that clause 7 places on the police. The annexe states simply that the defendant, or applicant in this case,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;would be able to plead not guilty and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. instruct a defence to be mounted. The Special Judicial Tribunal would not have the power to remand in custody.&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>It does not specify the restrictions that the Government seek to impose on the police.</p><h4>10.45 pm</h4><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> Paragraph 7 of the proposals that I have in front of me says:</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;Once someone had been declared eligible, he or she would be free to return to Northern Ireland without risk of arrest for questioning or charge in relation to a qualifying offence.&#148;</ul></p><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> I thank the Minister. That is in paragraph 7, but it does not say here&#151;<i>[Interruption.] </i>As my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East, rightly points out, that is only for someone returning to Northern Ireland from outside the jurisdiction. As we know, Sir Nicholas, the net for the legislation is cast much wider than that. Nowhere here does it say that the police cannot take fingerprints or do the other things that clause 7 stops them doing.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> I referred to that in the context of those who are returning from outside the jurisdiction. The historic inquiry team proposals can continue, and only at the stage where an individual is charged can they apply for a certificate. Under the historic inquiry route, an individual may have an investigation by the police undertaken against them, and at some point they may be charged by the police for an alleged offence. At that stage, they can apply for a certificate.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> If that is the case, then why do the Government not distinguish in the Bill between those returning to the jurisdiction&#151;the real on-the-runs, for whom the original deal was done&#151;and those in the jurisdiction who the police may suspect as a result of the cold case inquiry team, whose work is ongoing and started well before 1 November. Where do we draw the line here?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> If your patience will allow, Sir Nicholas, I refer the hon. Gentleman back to certificates of eligibility and their criteria. Returning to clause 3(2):</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;An applicant falls within this subsection&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>on a number of grounds. The first is when the police suspect that, prior to 1 November 2005, the applicant was guilty of an offence; secondly,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant would have been arrested for the offence&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>if he had been in the United Kingdom at the time; thirdly, that</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant has been charged with an offence to which this Act applies&#148;&#151;</ul></p><p align=left>that relates to the historical inquiry team aspect&#151;or, fourthly, that</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant has been convicted of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an offence and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has not been sentenced for it&#148;,</ul></p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 290</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>or,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;is unlawfully at large&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>The potential elements for clause 7 are therefore dealt with in the eligibility criteria. I shall try to clarify the point again for the hon. Gentleman: for people currently on the run, the exemptions relating to certified offences will certainly apply. However, those who enter the scheme as a result of being charged, say, as a result of the historical inquiry team review, will be unable to benefit from most of clause 7&#146;s provisions because the very fact that they have been charged would mean that the police investigation had been completed. They can therefore qualify for the scheme. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> The Minister is confirming to the Committee what some of its members have believed all along: that the legislation primarily benefits OTRs to the disadvantage of others. The Minister has confirmed that the clause 7 powers reflect the agreement made in 2003 and has now, in reply to the hon. Member for Lagan Valley, said that the cold case review team would be something different. So the Minister can now confirm to the Committee what we thought all along. This clause almost exclusively benefits OTRs who may wish to return.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> The clause will benefit individuals who have not yet been charged, because of their suspected offences, or who would have been arrested for offences but for the fact that they were outside the United Kingdom. Again, it does not impact those who are involved through the historic inquiry team because, returning to the certificate of eligibility aspect, individuals who can join the scheme because they are potentially being charged under that team&#146;s work cannot avail themselves of the provisions of clause 7 until such time as they have been charged. The very fact that they have been charged means that the police will not necessarily need to investigate them further by taking samples, or using other aspects of the scheme.</p><p align=left>The answer to the hon. Lady&#146;s question is therefore yes, but the purpose of the scheme is to ensure that we get individuals back to face the special tribunal while the eligibility criteria elsewhere mean that the historic inquiry team will not be hampered by the clause 7 provisions.</p><p align=left>I was questioned, on a fine BBC programme, about the comments of Paul Leighton, the Deputy Chief Constable, at the Policing Board that the hon. Member for East Antrim attended last week. Following questions from that hon. Gentleman, the Deputy Chief Constable made some comments on this matter. I hope that I can clarify, both for the hon. Gentleman and for the Deputy Chief Constable, that nothing in the clause will hamper or hinder the progress of the historic inquiries team, which has a mandate to investigate unsolved crimes.</p><p align=left>We all want the individuals who have been responsible for those crimes to be identified, we want the victims to know, if possible, what has happened to their loved ones, and ultimately, if evidence can be produced, we want individuals to be charged with those offences. At the moment that they are charged <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 291</b><br>&nbsp;<br>they can, under the eligibility criteria, apply for admission to the scheme. That is the stage for the exemptions, and they would not hinder investigations by the police, who would already have charged individuals under the historic inquiries team.</p><p align=left>I accept that there is a difference of opinion in the Committee. Once individuals have been charged under the historic inquiries team and have applied for their certificate, they will progress to the special tribunal. If found guilty, they will be convicted and, if convicted, released on licence&#151;but they will still have been charged under that scheme. I hope that that is of some assistance to the hon. Lady.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> Will the Minister confirm what I think he is saying, so that we are all clear on this point? Let us say that an on-the-run terrorist who has committed the most heinous of crimes returns to Northern Ireland waving their certificate of eligibility. Clause 7 will then kick into action, meaning that that person cannot be arrested or detained, their home or other premises cannot be entered or searched, they cannot be put in custody or bailed&#151;indeed, if they are not in custody, obviously there can be no bail&#151;and fingerprints or samples cannot be taken. In other words, if a person who has been on the run for however many years returns to Northern Ireland with their certificate, that is the end of the track for them. The special prosecutor will have no evidence on which to obtain a conviction that would allow the issue of a licence on which conditions could be imposed. Is that what the Minister is persuading us is the effect of the clause?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> I am saying that individuals charged by the historic inquiries team will have been charged because it will have reached conclusions to that effect. At that stage, individuals under the historic inquiries team can apply for a licence and will not be affected by the clause, because to enter the scheme, they will already have been charged. In relation to individuals on the run, subsection (2)(a) of clause 3, &#147;Certificates of eligibility&#148;, says that there must be</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant to be guilty of an offence&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>and that</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant would have been arrested for the offence before that date but for the fact that he was believed to be outside the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>Certainly there is the potential for those investigations and the information not to have an impact on that, but the very fact of eligibility means that the individual is under reasonable grounds of suspicion and/or would have been arrested had they been in the jurisdiction at the time. I am fairly confident that such a case could go to the special tribunal for conviction in due course.</p><p align=left>I stress that the exemptions do not apply at large, but only in relation to certified offences. Those who have entered the scheme as a result of being charged will be unable to benefit from most of the provisions in the clause. I believe that to delete them would not be in the interests of the good management of the scheme. I therefore urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendments.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 292</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> I note that the Minister has made an effort to clarify the confusion arising from the application of the clause. I understood him to say that if the cold case review team suspects that a member of a paramilitary organisation may have been involved in, for example, a murder, it can, notwithstanding the Bill when it is enacted, arrest that individual, interrogate them, take fingerprint samples and so on. Only when they charge that individual can the individual apply for a certificate of eligibility.</p><p align=left>The hon. Member for North Down is correct to say that in the main, the provision applies to those who are on the run and outside the jurisdiction. Notwithstanding that, we still believe that the basis for our amendments, which aim to uphold the right of the police to hold a proper investigation, is crucial. If the Government do not want to give the impression that the provision is an amnesty for on-the-runs, they must ensure that the investigatory powers of the police are sufficient to ensure that prosecutions can be brought through the special tribunal, and that the special prosecutor has some evidence to present to the tribunal to secure those prosecutions.</p><p align=left>It is difficult to see how the police can gather evidence to present to the tribunal and the special prosecutor to secure a conviction when they cannot arrest or detain the suspect, cannot enter or search the suspect&#146;s premises or other premises, cannot remand the suspect in custody or on bail, and have no power to take fingerprints or samples. It means that they do not have the capacity to check whether the suspect might have been involved in other crimes. For those reasons, and because we are anxious to ensure that the provision does not amount to an amnesty for those who are on the run and want to evade the judicial process, we shall press the amendment to a Division.</p><p align=left><i>Question put, </i>That the amendment be made:&#151;</p><p align=left><i>The Committee divided: </i> Ayes 9, Noes 20.</p><p>[Division No. 31]</p><p align=left><b>AYES</b></p>Bellingham, Mr. Henry<br>Donaldson, Mr. Jeffrey M.<br>Ellwood, Mr. Tobias<br>Hermon, Lady<br>Hunt, Mr. Jeremy<br>Robertson, Mr. Laurence<br>Robinson, Mr. Peter<br>Wallace, Mr. Ben<br>Wilson, Sammy<p><p align=left><b>NOES</b></p>Anderson, Mr. David<br>Banks, Gordon<br>Brown, Mr. Russell<br>Burt, Lorely<br>Coaker, Mr. Vernon<br>Cooper, Rosie<br>Durkan, Mark<br>Foster, Mr. Michael<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Worcester)<br>Hanson, Mr. David<br>Harris, Mr. Tom<br>Hendrick, Mr. Mark<br>Hillier, Meg<br>Irranca-Davies, Huw<br>McDonagh, Siobhain<br>McDonnell, Dr Alasdair<br>Moon, Mrs. Madeleine<br>&Ouml;pik, Lembit<br>Slaughter, Mr. Andrew<br>Todd, Mr. Mark<br>Waltho, Lynda<br><p align=left><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p><p align=left><i>Motion made, and Question put, </i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p><ql<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 293</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><i>The Committee divided: </i> Ayes 16, Noes 13.</p><p>[Division No. 32]</p><p align=left><b>AYES</b></p>Anderson, Mr. David<br>Banks, Gordon<br>Brown, Mr. Russell<br>Coaker, Mr. Vernon<br>Cooper, Rosie<br>Foster, Mr. Michael<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Worcester)<br>Hanson, Mr. David<br>Harris, Mr. Tom<br>Hendrick, Mr. Mark<br>Hillier, Meg<br>Irranca-Davies, Huw<br>McDonagh, Siobhain<br>Moon, Mrs. Madeleine<br>Slaughter, Mr. Andrew<br>Todd, Mr. Mark<br>Waltho, Lynda<p><p align=left><b>NOES</b></p>Bellingham, Mr. Henry<br>Burt, Lorely<br>Donaldson, Mr. Jeffrey M.<br>Durkan, Mark<br>Ellwood, Mr. Tobias<br>Hermon, Lady<br>Hunt, Mr. Jeremy<br>McDonnell, Dr Alasdair<br>&Ouml;pik, Lembit<br>Robertson, Mr. Laurence<br>Robinson, Mr. Peter<br>Wallace, Mr. Ben<br>Wilson, Sammy<br><p align=left><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p><p align=left><i>Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> I have been approached by the usual channels representing the political parties that are taking part in our discussions, and I believe that it will be for the benefit of the Committee and the proper conduct of our business if I suspend the sitting for 20 minutes.</p><h4>11.01 pm</h4><p align=left><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p><h4>11.23 pm</h4><p align=left><i>On resuming&#151;</i></p><p align=center><b>Clause 8</b></p><p align=center class="smallcaps">Trial by Special Tribunal</p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> I hope that people feel rested, and that we can begin round 3 of today&#146;s sitting. The first item is really a matter left over from an earlier debate: the Liberal Democrats suggested that they wanted to move amendment No. 70 formally, so I ask Lembit &Ouml;pik to do so.</p><p align=left><b>Lembit &Ouml;pik:</b> I feel a lot calmer now, so on the basis of the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Belfast, East, I shall not move amendment No. 70 after all. It would be inconsistent for me to move my amendment, given our earlier debate. I simply tell the Minister that he is definitely on a promise to deliver something meaningful on the subject of defendants appearing, and we shall be watching him.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 294</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in clause 8, page 6, line 3, at end insert&#151;</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#145;(6A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Special Tribunal convicts and sentences a person of an offence he must make a public expression of remorse, previously approved by the Special Tribunal, before a licence is granted.&#146;.</ul></p><p align=left>We have imposed strictures on ourselves, and this is the test of them. The amendment is fairly self-explanatory; it deals with the issue of an expression of remorse. Let me translate for hon. Members from the rather small logistical issues that we have discussed thus far to the stage after the certification process, the special tribunal and all prosecution issues. Let us say that there has been a conviction in court. Someone has been found guilty by the special tribunal, and sentence is about to be handed down. If they are to benefit from the Bill, and are not to be required to spend even a day in prison, the very least that victims can expect is for them to be prepared, at that stage, to show some remorse and indicate their sorrow and regret.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Harris:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, and I have some sympathy with it, but does he not see a contradiction, in that prisoners previously released on licence under the Good Friday agreement were not obliged to make a similar public statement? It might be contradictory to suggest that those covered by the Bill make a commitment that other prisoners on an early release scheme were not asked to make.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> I am very happy to ensure parity; if the hon. Gentleman wants parity, let us have it. Let us have those caught under the legislation put in prison for up to two years. But if they are not going to go to prison for two years&#151;if they are to walk straight out of court&#151;the very least that can be expected is for them to show some sorrow. Quite frankly, if they are not sorry for what they have done, then why on earth are the Government jumping through hoops for them, and allowing them to go out on the streets without any regrets for the murder or other terrorist activity that they committed? It just would not be a sensible course for the Government.</p><p align=left>The Government should be prepared to accept this minor requirement, which does not fly in the face of any of the deals that the Government have done with the IRA. It is a minimal requirement, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</p><p align=left><b>Lorely Burt:</b> We have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiments behind the amendment. Much of what the victims&#146; families want is for someone to take responsibility for the death of their loved one, and to show some signs of remorse for it. I wonder, though, whether a forced expression of regret is the right way to go about that. Is there not a risk that someone will just say that they are sorry so that they can get a licence? Although I agree that an expression of sorrow and regret would no doubt help the victims, surely victims would want it to be genuine.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> I never thought that I would see the day when I would be cautioning the DUP on the dubious value of an act of contrition, but requiring a statement of remorse as part of the procedure would <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 295</b><br>&nbsp;<br>mean that we ended up with something formulaic and empty. After a while, I imagine that the expressions of remorse would all be exactly the same, particularly if they had to be approved by the tribunal. Imagine just how stylised and formulaic they would become. They would be pretty empty and meaningless, particularly to victims. I actually think that an empty statement of remorse would be more offensive to victims than almost anything else, because the perpetrator could hide behind that statement.</p><p align=left>We might be able to hide behind a statement of remorse as something that improved the Bill, but such an empty process would not make victims feel any better. Such an expression of remorse could cause offence, and where it did not cause offence, it would degenerate into farce.</p><p align=left>There is one other reason why we need to be careful about including such a provision. I believe that there will not be many convictions under this procedure, but someone who applies under the scheme and asserts their innocence might just end up being found guilty. In a previous sitting I said that I knew of a case involving a number of young men in my constituency, some of whom were at school with me, who fled; they were on-the-runs. I believe that they were innocent. If there is to be a scheme such as this, I want them to be able to benefit from it, but I want them to assert their innocence in court. I would not want a situation where if they were found guilty, in order to benefit from the scheme, having asserted their innocence, they had to express remorse. That would go against all sorts of natural justice. In the past, that has been an issue when prisoners go through the life sentence review board process; the test of remorse has been imposed on people who were still insisting on asserting their innocence. We would be better off without the amendment.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> For the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle&#151;I am pleased to agree with him, and for him to agree with me&#151;and the hon. Member for Solihull, I am unable to accept the amendment. They have sensibly pointed out two elements that give me cause for concern in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Belfast, East.</p><p align=left>The first is that expressions of remorse are not required in normal trials, nor were they required under the early release scheme, as my hon. Friend said. The Government are seeking to put terrorist suspects through a judicial process, albeit one that results in release on licence. It is a process that includes conviction and sentence in as normal a way as can be done in the special tribunal circumstances. To add a requirement that a person who is found guilty must make an expression of remorse has nothing to do with <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 296</b><br>&nbsp;<br>the trial, but in many ways seeks to move towards what the Government have already considered and not acted on, in part because of the recommendations of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee&#151;a truth and reconciliation commission of sorts. Such an approach is not our purpose in the legislation.</p><p align=left>The second point relates to what was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle and the hon. Member for Solihull. How can we judge, measure or guarantee the quality or the nature of any remorse shown after the conviction has taken place?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hendrick:</b> Is it not the case that if there is no obligation to express remorse or give any apology, any apology or remorse that is shown would be valued much more by the victims, because it would be voluntary?</p></td></tr></table><a name="end"><table width=90%><tr valign=top><td colspan=2>&nbsp;<br><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051213/pm/pt2/51213s05.htm"/>

However, last Thursday, in his enthusiasm to tell us why victims should not have any knowledge of certificates of eligibility that have been issued, he pointed out that when someone applies for a certificate and that certificate is granted,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the police may not have sufficient information to charge the person&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>Indeed, he went further:</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 288</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;when a person applies to the certification commissioner, in many cases charges will not have been brought. There may be grounds for arrest, but in some cases there may not even be that.&#148;&#151;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee B, </i>8 December 2005; c. 129.]</ul></p><p align=left>According to the Minister, when a person applies for a certificate, there may not even be grounds for arrest. The police may not have sufficient information to charge the person.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> My hon. Friend will know that under the criteria set down in clause 3(2)(i), at the stage where a certificate of eligibility is being sought the police officer is only required to have &#147;reasonable grounds for suspecting&#148;. No police officer would send a case to the DPP or the special prosecutor if he just had reasonable grounds for suspecting; that is the stage when he would bring somebody in, start his cross-examination and follow up leads. The critical issue will be fingerprints, because those, and the other tests, will tell the police officer not just whether that person is responsible for the crime under review, but whether he was responsible for more up-to-date crimes.</p><p align=left><b>Sammy Wilson:</b> That is exactly the point that the police have been making, and the Minister made the same point in this Committee. When the certificate is being applied for, the police may not have sufficient information to charge a person. The Minister did not want the victims to know about the certificate, because it might be premature. If it is premature&#151;by the Minister&#146;s admission that might be so&#151;how does he expect the police to build the case?</p><p align=left>As the hon. Member for Foyle suggested, is not the true intent of the Bill to make it impossible for a case to be built against the person? The Bill is weighed against the victim and in favour of the defendant, and that may suit the Government in many cases. It will certainly suit the people who wanted the Bill in the first place to make it as difficult as possible to get convictions&#151;and on the Minister&#146;s own admission, and on the evidence that the police have put forward and the points that they have made, it is clear that that will be the outcome.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> I refute the suggestion made by the hon. Member for East Antrim that the Government do not wish to seek convictions under the scheme. If that were so, it would have been easy to design the scheme differently to make sure that that outcome was achieved. The Government have designed it to ensure that there is accountability, potential convictions if people are found guilty of charges, and a release on licence. The clause 7 exemptions are key elements in the scheme and reflect the 2003 proposals in detail; they allow the certificate holder to return to Northern Ireland without risking arrest, being questioned, or otherwise, by the police.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> Will the Minister explain how that reflects in detail the 2003 proposals?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> The clause 7 exemptions are included in the 2003 proposals.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 289</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> I have checked the proposals that were published in the annexe to the joint declaration at Hillsborough in 2003, but I cannot see spelled out in detail the restrictions that clause 7 places on the police. The annexe states simply that the defendant, or applicant in this case,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;would be able to plead not guilty and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. instruct a defence to be mounted. The Special Judicial Tribunal would not have the power to remand in custody.&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>It does not specify the restrictions that the Government seek to impose on the police.</p><h4>10.45 pm</h4><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> Paragraph 7 of the proposals that I have in front of me says:</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;Once someone had been declared eligible, he or she would be free to return to Northern Ireland without risk of arrest for questioning or charge in relation to a qualifying offence.&#148;</ul></p><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> I thank the Minister. That is in paragraph 7, but it does not say here&#151;<i>[Interruption.] </i>As my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East, rightly points out, that is only for someone returning to Northern Ireland from outside the jurisdiction. As we know, Sir Nicholas, the net for the legislation is cast much wider than that. Nowhere here does it say that the police cannot take fingerprints or do the other things that clause 7 stops them doing.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> I referred to that in the context of those who are returning from outside the jurisdiction. The historic inquiry team proposals can continue, and only at the stage where an individual is charged can they apply for a certificate. Under the historic inquiry route, an individual may have an investigation by the police undertaken against them, and at some point they may be charged by the police for an alleged offence. At that stage, they can apply for a certificate.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> If that is the case, then why do the Government not distinguish in the Bill between those returning to the jurisdiction&#151;the real on-the-runs, for whom the original deal was done&#151;and those in the jurisdiction who the police may suspect as a result of the cold case inquiry team, whose work is ongoing and started well before 1 November. Where do we draw the line here?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> If your patience will allow, Sir Nicholas, I refer the hon. Gentleman back to certificates of eligibility and their criteria. Returning to clause 3(2):</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;An applicant falls within this subsection&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>on a number of grounds. The first is when the police suspect that, prior to 1 November 2005, the applicant was guilty of an offence; secondly,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant would have been arrested for the offence&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>if he had been in the United Kingdom at the time; thirdly, that</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant has been charged with an offence to which this Act applies&#148;&#151;</ul></p><p align=left>that relates to the historical inquiry team aspect&#151;or, fourthly, that</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant has been convicted of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an offence and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has not been sentenced for it&#148;,</ul></p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 290</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>or,</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;is unlawfully at large&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>The potential elements for clause 7 are therefore dealt with in the eligibility criteria. I shall try to clarify the point again for the hon. Gentleman: for people currently on the run, the exemptions relating to certified offences will certainly apply. However, those who enter the scheme as a result of being charged, say, as a result of the historical inquiry team review, will be unable to benefit from most of clause 7&#146;s provisions because the very fact that they have been charged would mean that the police investigation had been completed. They can therefore qualify for the scheme. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> The Minister is confirming to the Committee what some of its members have believed all along: that the legislation primarily benefits OTRs to the disadvantage of others. The Minister has confirmed that the clause 7 powers reflect the agreement made in 2003 and has now, in reply to the hon. Member for Lagan Valley, said that the cold case review team would be something different. So the Minister can now confirm to the Committee what we thought all along. This clause almost exclusively benefits OTRs who may wish to return.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> The clause will benefit individuals who have not yet been charged, because of their suspected offences, or who would have been arrested for offences but for the fact that they were outside the United Kingdom. Again, it does not impact those who are involved through the historic inquiry team because, returning to the certificate of eligibility aspect, individuals who can join the scheme because they are potentially being charged under that team&#146;s work cannot avail themselves of the provisions of clause 7 until such time as they have been charged. The very fact that they have been charged means that the police will not necessarily need to investigate them further by taking samples, or using other aspects of the scheme.</p><p align=left>The answer to the hon. Lady&#146;s question is therefore yes, but the purpose of the scheme is to ensure that we get individuals back to face the special tribunal while the eligibility criteria elsewhere mean that the historic inquiry team will not be hampered by the clause 7 provisions.</p><p align=left>I was questioned, on a fine BBC programme, about the comments of Paul Leighton, the Deputy Chief Constable, at the Policing Board that the hon. Member for East Antrim attended last week. Following questions from that hon. Gentleman, the Deputy Chief Constable made some comments on this matter. I hope that I can clarify, both for the hon. Gentleman and for the Deputy Chief Constable, that nothing in the clause will hamper or hinder the progress of the historic inquiries team, which has a mandate to investigate unsolved crimes.</p><p align=left>We all want the individuals who have been responsible for those crimes to be identified, we want the victims to know, if possible, what has happened to their loved ones, and ultimately, if evidence can be produced, we want individuals to be charged with those offences. At the moment that they are charged <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 291</b><br>&nbsp;<br>they can, under the eligibility criteria, apply for admission to the scheme. That is the stage for the exemptions, and they would not hinder investigations by the police, who would already have charged individuals under the historic inquiries team.</p><p align=left>I accept that there is a difference of opinion in the Committee. Once individuals have been charged under the historic inquiries team and have applied for their certificate, they will progress to the special tribunal. If found guilty, they will be convicted and, if convicted, released on licence&#151;but they will still have been charged under that scheme. I hope that that is of some assistance to the hon. Lady.</p><p align=left><b>Lady Hermon:</b> Will the Minister confirm what I think he is saying, so that we are all clear on this point? Let us say that an on-the-run terrorist who has committed the most heinous of crimes returns to Northern Ireland waving their certificate of eligibility. Clause 7 will then kick into action, meaning that that person cannot be arrested or detained, their home or other premises cannot be entered or searched, they cannot be put in custody or bailed&#151;indeed, if they are not in custody, obviously there can be no bail&#151;and fingerprints or samples cannot be taken. In other words, if a person who has been on the run for however many years returns to Northern Ireland with their certificate, that is the end of the track for them. The special prosecutor will have no evidence on which to obtain a conviction that would allow the issue of a licence on which conditions could be imposed. Is that what the Minister is persuading us is the effect of the clause?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> I am saying that individuals charged by the historic inquiries team will have been charged because it will have reached conclusions to that effect. At that stage, individuals under the historic inquiries team can apply for a licence and will not be affected by the clause, because to enter the scheme, they will already have been charged. In relation to individuals on the run, subsection (2)(a) of clause 3, &#147;Certificates of eligibility&#148;, says that there must be</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;reasonable grounds for suspecting the applicant to be guilty of an offence&#148;</ul></p><p align=left>and that</p><p align=left class "tabletext"><ul>&#147;the applicant would have been arrested for the offence before that date but for the fact that he was believed to be outside the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul></p><p align=left>Certainly there is the potential for those investigations and the information not to have an impact on that, but the very fact of eligibility means that the individual is under reasonable grounds of suspicion and/or would have been arrested had they been in the jurisdiction at the time. I am fairly confident that such a case could go to the special tribunal for conviction in due course.</p><p align=left>I stress that the exemptions do not apply at large, but only in relation to certified offences. Those who have entered the scheme as a result of being charged will be unable to benefit from most of the provisions in the clause. I believe that to delete them would not be in the interests of the good management of the scheme. I therefore urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendments.</p><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 292</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><b>Mr. Donaldson:</b> I note that the Minister has made an effort to clarify the confusion arising from the application of the clause. I understood him to say that if the cold case review team suspects that a member of a paramilitary organisation may have been involved in, for example, a murder, it can, notwithstanding the Bill when it is enacted, arrest that individual, interrogate them, take fingerprint samples and so on. Only when they charge that individual can the individual apply for a certificate of eligibility.</p><p align=left>The hon. Member for North Down is correct to say that in the main, the provision applies to those who are on the run and outside the jurisdiction. Notwithstanding that, we still believe that the basis for our amendments, which aim to uphold the right of the police to hold a proper investigation, is crucial. If the Government do not want to give the impression that the provision is an amnesty for on-the-runs, they must ensure that the investigatory powers of the police are sufficient to ensure that prosecutions can be brought through the special tribunal, and that the special prosecutor has some evidence to present to the tribunal to secure those prosecutions.</p><p align=left>It is difficult to see how the police can gather evidence to present to the tribunal and the special prosecutor to secure a conviction when they cannot arrest or detain the suspect, cannot enter or search the suspect&#146;s premises or other premises, cannot remand the suspect in custody or on bail, and have no power to take fingerprints or samples. It means that they do not have the capacity to check whether the suspect might have been involved in other crimes. For those reasons, and because we are anxious to ensure that the provision does not amount to an amnesty for those who are on the run and want to evade the judicial process, we shall press the amendment to a Division.</p><p align=left><i>Question put, </i>That the amendment be made:&#151;</p><p align=left><i>The Committee divided: </i> Ayes 9, Noes 20.</p><p>[Division No. 31]</p><p align=left><b>AYES</b></p>Bellingham, Mr. Henry<br>Donaldson, Mr. Jeffrey M.<br>Ellwood, Mr. Tobias<br>Hermon, Lady<br>Hunt, Mr. Jeremy<br>Robertson, Mr. Laurence<br>Robinson, Mr. Peter<br>Wallace, Mr. Ben<br>Wilson, Sammy<p><p align=left><b>NOES</b></p>Anderson, Mr. David<br>Banks, Gordon<br>Brown, Mr. Russell<br>Burt, Lorely<br>Coaker, Mr. Vernon<br>Cooper, Rosie<br>Durkan, Mark<br>Foster, Mr. Michael (Worcester)<br>Hanson, Mr. David<br>Harris, Mr. Tom<br>Hendrick, Mr. Mark<br>Hillier, Meg<br>Irranca-Davies, Huw<br>McDonagh, Siobhain<br>McDonnell, Dr Alasdair<br>Moon, Mrs. Madeleine<br>&Ouml;pik, Lembit<br>Slaughter, Mr. Andrew<br>Todd, Mr. Mark<br>Waltho, Lynda<br><p align=left><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p><p align=left><i>Motion made, and Question put, </i>That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p><ql<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 293</b><br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left><i>The Committee divided: </i> Ayes 16, Noes 13.</p><p>[Division No. 32]</p><p align=left><b>AYES</b></p>Anderson, Mr. David<br>Banks, Gordon<br>Brown, Mr. Russell<br>Coaker, Mr. Vernon<br>Cooper, Rosie<br>Foster, Mr. Michael (Worcester)<br>Hanson, Mr. David<br>Harris, Mr. Tom<br>Hendrick, Mr. Mark<br>Hillier, Meg<br>Irranca-Davies, Huw<br>McDonagh, Siobhain<br>Moon, Mrs. Madeleine<br>Slaughter, Mr. Andrew<br>Todd, Mr. Mark<br>Waltho, Lynda<p><p align=left><b>NOES</b></p>Bellingham, Mr. Henry<br>Burt, Lorely<br>Donaldson, Mr. Jeffrey M.<br>Durkan, Mark<br>Ellwood, Mr. Tobias<br>Hermon, Lady<br>Hunt, Mr. Jeremy<br>McDonnell, Dr Alasdair<br>&Ouml;pik, Lembit<br>Robertson, Mr. Laurence<br>Robinson, Mr. Peter<br>Wallace, Mr. Ben<br>Wilson, Sammy<br><p align=left><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p><p align=left><i>Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> I have been approached by the usual channels representing the political parties that are taking part in our discussions, and I believe that it will be for the benefit of the Committee and the proper conduct of our business if I suspend the sitting for 20 minutes.</p><h4>11.01 pm</h4><p align=left><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p><h4>11.23 pm</h4><p align=left><i>On resuming&#151;</i></p><p align=center><b>Clause 8</b></p><p align=center class="smallcaps">Trial by Special Tribunal</p><p align=left><b>The Chairman:</b> I hope that people feel rested, and that we can begin round 3 of today&#146;s sitting.

Member for Belfast, East, I shall not move amendment No. 70 after all. It would be inconsistent for me to move my amendment, given our earlier debate.

The amendment is fairly self-explanatory; it deals with the issue of an expression of remorse. Let me translate for hon. Members from the rather small logistical issues that we have discussed thus far to the stage after the certification process, the special tribunal and all prosecution issues. Let us say that there has been a conviction in court. Someone has been found guilty by the special tribunal, and sentence is about to be handed down. If they are to benefit from the Bill, and are not to be required to spend even a day in prison, the very least that victims can expect is for them to be prepared, at that stage, to show some remorse and indicate their sorrow and regret.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Harris:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, and I have some sympathy with it, but does he not see a contradiction, in that prisoners previously released on licence under the Good Friday agreement were not obliged to make a similar public statement? It might be contradictory to suggest that those covered by the Bill make a commitment that other prisoners on an early release scheme were not asked to make.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Robinson:</b> I am very happy to ensure parity; if the hon. Gentleman wants parity, let us have it. Let us have those caught under the legislation put in prison for up to two years. But if they are not going to go to prison for two years&#151;if they are to walk straight out of court&#151;the very least that can be expected is for them to show some sorrow. Quite frankly, if they are not sorry for what they have done, then why on earth are the Government jumping through hoops for them, and allowing them to go out on the streets without any regrets for the murder or other terrorist activity that they committed? It just would not be a sensible course for the Government.</p><p align=left>The Government should be prepared to accept this minor requirement, which does not fly in the face of any of the deals that the Government have done with the IRA. It is a minimal requirement, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</p><p align=left><b>Lorely Burt:</b> We have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiments behind the amendment. Much of what the victims&#146; families want is for someone to take responsibility for the death of their loved one, and to show some signs of remorse for it. I wonder, though, whether a forced expression of regret is the right way to go about that. Is there not a risk that someone will just say that they are sorry so that they can get a licence? Although I agree that an expression of sorrow and regret would no doubt help the victims, surely victims would want it to be genuine.</p><p align=left><b>Mark Durkan:</b> I never thought that I would see the day when I would be cautioning the DUP on the dubious value of an act of contrition, but requiring a statement of remorse as part of the procedure would <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 295</b><br>&nbsp;<br>mean that we ended up with something formulaic and empty. After a while, I imagine that the expressions of remorse would all be exactly the same, particularly if they had to be approved by the tribunal. Imagine just how stylised and formulaic they would become. They would be pretty empty and meaningless, particularly to victims. I actually think that an empty statement of remorse would be more offensive to victims than almost anything else, because the perpetrator could hide behind that statement.</p><p align=left>We might be able to hide behind a statement of remorse as something that improved the Bill, but such an empty process would not make victims feel any better. Such an expression of remorse could cause offence, and where it did not cause offence, it would degenerate into farce.</p><p align=left>There is one other reason why we need to be careful about including such a provision. I believe that there will not be many convictions under this procedure, but someone who applies under the scheme and asserts their innocence might just end up being found guilty. In a previous sitting I said that I knew of a case involving a number of young men in my constituency, some of whom were at school with me, who fled; they were on-the-runs. I believe that they were innocent. If there is to be a scheme such as this, I want them to be able to benefit from it, but I want them to assert their innocence in court. I would not want a situation where if they were found guilty, in order to benefit from the scheme, having asserted their innocence, they had to express remorse. That would go against all sorts of natural justice. In the past, that has been an issue when prisoners go through the life sentence review board process; the test of remorse has been imposed on people who were still insisting on asserting their innocence. We would be better off without the amendment.</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hanson:</b> For the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle&#151;I am pleased to agree with him, and for him to agree with me&#151;and the hon. Member for Solihull, I am unable to accept the amendment. They have sensibly pointed out two elements that give me cause for concern in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Belfast, East.</p><p align=left>The first is that expressions of remorse are not required in normal trials, nor were they required under the early release scheme, as my hon. Friend said. The Government are seeking to put terrorist suspects through a judicial process, albeit one that results in release on licence. It is a process that includes conviction and sentence in as normal a way as can be done in the special tribunal circumstances. To add a requirement that a person who is found guilty must make an expression of remorse has nothing to do with <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Column Number: 296</b><br>&nbsp;<br>the trial, but in many ways seeks to move towards what the Government have already considered and not acted on, in part because of the recommendations of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee&#151;a truth and reconciliation commission of sorts. Such an approach is not our purpose in the legislation.</p><p align=left>The second point relates to what was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Foyle and the hon. Member for Solihull. How can we judge, measure or guarantee the quality or the nature of any remorse shown after the conviction has taken place?</p><p align=left><b>Mr. Hendrick:</b> Is it not the case that if there is no obligation to express remorse or give any apology, any apology or remorse that is shown would be valued much more by the victims, because it would be voluntary?</p></td></tr></table><a name="end"><table width=90%><tr valign=top><td colspan=2>&nbsp;<br><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/b/st051213/pm/pt2/51213s05.htm"/>
