 we are certainly looking at making address changes and the reporting of them to the commission a requirement. His point was perfectly valid.</p>

With the introduction of CMEC, at least three different methods of calculating income will be running at the same time: the original system, which many of our constituents are still on; the so-called new system introduced in 2000; and the new CMEC system. That will add to confusion and error and will not give CMEC the chance to have a real break from the past difficulties of the CSA.</p>

 <p><a name="07101126000054"></a>Like me, many hon. Members will have a large number of constituents&#151;usually absent parents&#151;coming into their surgeries complaining that they have not been transferred or &#147;migrated&#148; to the new rules introduced seven years ago. Everyone was supposed to have migrated four years ago. We have all had to explain that that did not happened because of the failure of the IT system. The effect has been that two people in identical circumstances&#151;in the case of parents with care&#151;can receive vastly different amounts depending on the date on which their case entered the system. That is patently unfair and has led to a great deal of bitterness among those in the system. It seems that the basic starting point of any redesign of the system must be that it is transparent, fair and accepted by those whom it will affect. I concede that that last point will probably be a hope too far in many cases, but it seems sensible to try to ensure that it has the greatest possible acceptance. To do so, we must ensure that everyone is treated in the same way by the system, and that will not be achieved unless everyone is on the same system of calculation and are seen to be treated the same.</p>
