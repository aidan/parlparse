 <p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="70605h0006.htm_para28"><a name="07060543000217">To sum up, one final point to mention is the progress made on the Sustainable Communities Bill, which is dear to the Minister&#146;s heart. He and I have both served on the Committee on that Bill. One issue that he raised in replying to a point that I had made about second homes is that there is real scope for looking at what tools local authorities and local communities need to meet local problems. I hope that, through the progress of the Bill, we will start to get some of those tools and to empower local authorities and local communities to take decisions&#151;in this case on planning orders, in others on spending commitments&#151;to address the specific problems that they face in their local areas.</p>

  I congratulate the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods) on securing this excellent debate and on speaking forensically and with real authority about an issue that affects not only her constituency but, as has been made clear in the debate, constituencies up and down the country.</p>
