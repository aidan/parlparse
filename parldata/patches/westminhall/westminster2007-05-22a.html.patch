It is important, and it has made me think clearly about whether we should consider more regulation for the franchising sector and whether current support is appropriate. I do not believe that the time has come for formal regulation, and I am not convinced that it would necessarily have provided the right support to the individuals who lost so much money in the constituencies of my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire and the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="70522h0003.htm_para23"><a name="070522100000113">We should do what we can to support franchises, because they are an important route into entrepreneurship, as hon. Members have said. But at the end of the day, it is up to anyone venturing into business, whether as a franchise or independently, to make their own inquiries and decide what to do in the light of their own priorities, judgments and capacities. Of course they should seek professional advice, from whatever source&#151;we have discussed the role of the banks&#151;but whatever the advice, the judgment must in the end be down to the individual making the commitment. However, I take on board the issue of the BFA, and I shall come back to hon. Members on that. I hope that they feel that they have had a good opportunity this morning to air their constituents&#146; concerns, and I assure them that the Government have listened hard to what they have said about the experiences of those constituents.</p>
