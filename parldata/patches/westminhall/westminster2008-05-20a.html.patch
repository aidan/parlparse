 <p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80520h0008.htm_para13"><a name="08052034000283">One of the principle reasons for this debate was my wish to clarify the matter. There was a time when the BBC World Service radio service was not available in the United Kingdom. It then became available in the middle of the night, when Radio 4 was not broadcasting, and insomniacs could listen to it. Then, very sensibly, a couple of years ago came the expansion of digital TV and so on, and one can now listen happily to the World Service.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="80520h0008.htm_para14"><a name="08052034000284">My central contention is that if one can listen to the World Service, is there a substantive reason why one should not be able to view BBC World News? Why should it not be available on platforms like Freesat? After all, it is part of the BBC; it is something of which we should be proud. It gives a more international flavour to the news. Its wider availability in Britain would not seriously damage other international broadcasters such as al-Jazeera, Sky News and so on. It would provide a little more competition in the market, and little more choice for viewers.</p>

  Good afternoon, Mr. Martlew. I start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) on securing this debate. I confirm that I shall be travelling on the Heathrow Express tomorrow morning, and I shall watch BBC World News, as I regularly do. I shall be going to Moscow to support Manchester United; I hope that the game is without incident and that everyone enjoys a successful time in Moscow watching British football.</p>
