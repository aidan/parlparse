-20   per cent. by 2020 is really challenging. I note that the nuclear energy industry is going to run down. Whatever we say, there is currently no sign of any private sector investment coming in. We shall need that in the future. However, the most significant point has already been raised. Do we really want, by 2020, 70 per cent. of our electricity to be generated from gas, 90 per cent. of which will be imported? That would be a crazy situation to work ourselves into.
