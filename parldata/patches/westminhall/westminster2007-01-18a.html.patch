 <p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="70118h0003.htm_para1"><a name="07011856000085">When I was a councillor I went to a public house where the Labour party was having a meeting with the chair of the highways committee, Tony Burns, to talk about on-pavement parking. The local Labour party was up in arms about it and gave him a terrible time. After the meeting I came out of the pub, which had been mainly occupied by Labour party members&#151;the rest of the pub was empty&#151;and in front of it every car had its wheels on the pavement, because not to have done so would have blocked the road. It is a difficult issue. In principle, I am sympathetic to the Committee&#146;s view; in practice I think that it is better determined locally.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="70118h0003.htm_para2"><a name="07011856000086">My final point relates to what I think public service&#151;and car parking regulations&#151;should be about. The person I want to talk about will probably never read the report of the debate, but I was very grateful to him. Four or five years ago I was in the north bay in Scarborough, and stopped for a cup of tea at a little hut there. After about five minutes a parking attendant came up to me. There were no other cars parked there. It was a windy April day. He said, &#147;Excuse me, sir, but you are parked illegally. There is a space over there; you probably did not see the sign.&#148; It was visible, but I had not seen it. He asked me if I would mind moving my car, and I did. No nuisance was being caused by my car, but it was in the wrong place. That parking attendant&#146;s attitude was to be commended. It was much better than the brutal nastiness of Control Plus in Manchester some time ago. The parking attendant has my thanks not just for the fine he saved me but for showing what public service should be about.</p>

I want to commend the Committee Chairman, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), on the report and to say how much I have enjoyed my first few weeks on the Committee. I congratulate the other hon. Members who have spoken in the debate, who made some extremely pertinent points.</p>
