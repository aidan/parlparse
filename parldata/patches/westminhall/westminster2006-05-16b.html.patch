Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) on securing the debate. It is traditional to say that, but I also congratulate him on the content of his contribution. He made it very clear that the Liberal Democrats are fully supportive of all the work being done to ensure that London in 2012 has the best ever Olympics and Paralympics. However, he also made it crystal clear that our support comes with a clear understanding that we will be critical friends of the project, and that we will not be prohibited in any way from seeking answers to some of the crucial questions&#151;questions that were raised not only by my hon. Friend&#146;s constituents in Twickenham but by people across the country. I am delighted that he had an opportunity to put a series of questions to the Minister, and I am sure that we all look forward to the responses.</p>

During them, it has been traditional for the relative merits of the cities of Loughborough, Bath and Sheffield to be aired, and for the virtues that they have to offer in respect of the Olympic movement to be extolled. I am prepared today to agree to a self-denying ordinance to make mention no more of my wonderful city and the contribution it can make, if we get a similar assurance from the Minister in relation to Sheffield.</p>
