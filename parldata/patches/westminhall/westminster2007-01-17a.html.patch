Some of the demographic information upon which my county council has been working to develop its strategy will prove to be flawed. When all that is taken into account, local residents, particularly those in poorer communities, will be left in a much more difficult situation unless there is active Government intervention.</p>

I hope that the media pick that up, because it is a disgrace. It is a reflection on the kind of Opposition who we have got.</p>

Most people would consider the Knowsley part of my constituency to be urban&#151;and it largely is&#151;but my constituency contains quite a large rural part in Sefton. It is not uncommon for new houses in Knowsley to cost in excess of &#163;200,000, although that is not an average figure. Such a situation would have been inconceivable a few years ago. That partly reflects the success of the local economy, but it has implications for affordability, which is becoming an increasing problem.</p>

Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart) about housing market renewal, since the start of the pathfinder programme, more than 30,000 rundown homes have been refurbished and many houses demolished. Again, it is important that we do not just concentrate on houses and that we provide the types of houses that people want, are comfortable in, and will seek to live in and maintain. We have made progress on the number of empty homes.</p>
