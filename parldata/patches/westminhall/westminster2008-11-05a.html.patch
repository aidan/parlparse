  We all call the hon. Gentleman, &#147;My hon. Friend&#148;, and rightly so. Does he agree that the one issue the Government need to tackle is the lack of hard, verifiable data about the scale of the scams, frauds and cybercrime that are taking place? Even when hon.

Our job is to raise the awareness of the vulnerable so that they are less likely to be caught.</p>
