-):  This has been a good debate on a fine report. It was a great pleasure to take up my ministerial responsibilities and have a vade-mekum presented to me in my first red box. I invite the Select Committee to make similar reports on other parts of the world to help Ministers as they try to work their way through the maze of Government policy and choice. I say that not to flatter, but to express real appreciation for the quality and depth of the report.

 <a name="11206h01_para160">There has always been a strong British connection to Yugoslavia.

We have not been pro-Serb or pro-Croat, and instead have enjoyed a rich relationship.
