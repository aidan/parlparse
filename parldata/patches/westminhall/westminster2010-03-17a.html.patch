The agency should be made to finish all revaluations as an immediate priority, and councils should impose no financial penalties in respect of non-collection during this period, which should have a short but fixed time scale. If companies still have outstanding liabilities, there needs to be a deal to ensure that they cannot be placed in a position where they could go out of business through no fault of their own.</p>

I note from today's <i>Grimsby Telegraph</i> that Lord Bates, Opposition spokesman for the DCLG in the other place, has issued a statement saying that the Conservative party is in favour of a moratorium. Although that does not cancel the retrospection, it nevertheless offers a breathing space while rational decisions are made. At the very least, it would be a sensible start. The Government should respond in a similar way, content in the knowledge that other political parties would support them. The Government need to act as soon as possible. The clock is ticking; companies are folding; jobs are going. The Minister and her colleagues need to deliver. The problem is caused by their actions and their agency, and they need to resolve it.</p>
