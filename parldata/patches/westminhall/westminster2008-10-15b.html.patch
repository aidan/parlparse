I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response, and hope that she will implement the independent inquiry&#146;s recommendations, which we have discussed, as well as the full involvement of families&#151;we heard about that especially in the case of Tom, described by the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood). Let us ensure that the medical profession conforms to its statutory duty, and thus enables advocates to have teeth.</p>

  I congratulate the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) on securing this important debate, and I hope that he understands that if hon. Members take longer to read out questions than the time that I have left to reply, it is regrettably not always possible to answer each one.</p>
