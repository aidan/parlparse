  I congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) on securing this important debate. I thank him for giving me the chance to make my first speech in my new role. I agree with much of what he said, including what he said at the end of his speech about the benefits that further progress could bring to our economy and society.</p>
