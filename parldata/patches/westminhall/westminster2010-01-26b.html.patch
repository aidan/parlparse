 climate there. Proof will be needed in order claim against the fund. The country is working with farmers to plot variations in climate-and looking to farmers to plan their payments. Farmers in Africa often sell their produce in advance at a low price. That is obviously devastating for them, as they never escape from the trap, but by using the financial system they could even out their incomes and outgoings in a rational way.</p>

  I am delighted to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke). Moreover, I wish to congratulate the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) on securing this debate and on introducing it in such a comprehensive and measured way. He is right to address the debate that exists in the country about why we contribute so much to international development-I know that some argue that we are not doing enough, but that is part of the wider debate. I was pleased, too, to hear him explore the impact that microfinance can have in this country. The hon. Gentleman raised some broader points about international development, including this poor-countries-versus-poor-people argument about where we should target our assistance, particularly in the context of India and China. I appreciate that it is legitimate to explore such an area in the widest terms, but if we use, for example, the poverty of the country as a whole, we can quickly find other reasons, such as human rights records and behavioural patterns of Governments, to remove such countries from the equation as far as international development is concerned. We should therefore concentrate on the alleviation of poverty for the people rather than focusing on the country exclusively. In countries such as China, though, we should consider what the Department for International Development is doing, because important technical assistance work on climate change is under way. It is a two-way street in which we are learning from them and they are learning from us. Although we need to critically evaluate such important work, we should also continue to support it.</p>
