  I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. He is right that that was the style of operation in that regard. The complexity in this case involves the change from the certificates to the licensing regime that we put in place, and it would make legislation more difficult. I am prepared to say that this situation needs to be resolved&#151;it cannot and should not be left unresolved. Meetings should take place, and we will facilitate them. I am happy to meet hon. Members to discuss this further, although I am sending the message out loud and clear that it should be the RCA and the on-course bookmakers who reach an adequate conclusion, because that is the right way forward.</p>

Hopefully, we can get the interests of the racegoer and racing put to the forefront, because, as I have found in my short time in this job, many other issues in racing will need to be addressed. Racing is clearly an integral part of our culture and society, and I will look to the horse racing authorities to play their part; a number of disputes seem to be taking place on several issues and we now need to bottom them out. I am prepared to play my part in that, in consultation with hon. Members. Although the reassurances that I have given today will not meet all the requirements of the on-course bookmakers, I hope that they show the intention: this was not about the Gambling Act; it is about the ability of the industry to sort itself out&#151;I hope that that is what will take place.</p>
