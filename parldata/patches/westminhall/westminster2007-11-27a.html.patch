The drivers, all members of the Unite trade union, currently earn almost 15 per cent. less than other Manchester operators. I understand that the strike has been narrowly averted.

Buses would be cleaner, because contracts could require bus operators to provide newer, cleaner buses and to maintain them properly. However, to date, no authority has ever applied for such a contract.</p>

The traffic commissioners will also have a stronger role in monitoring bus punctuality and a broader range of sanctions to impose on operators that are failing to deliver a punctual service. The Bill will also enable the traffic commissioners to hold local authorities to account for their contribution to punctuality performance, and it will allow the creation of an influential new bus passenger champion to represent the interests of bus passengers.</p>

Such contracts should also give local authorities powers to consider a company&#146;s ties to the local community and thus its understanding of the community. Perhaps routes could be bid for in bundles, which could be packaged so that different routes were offered differently to meet the community&#146;s needs.</p>

Traffic commissioners could be given more powers, not only to intervene and correct bad behaviour, but to work more closely with the competition authorities where quality contracts are not in place. The commissioners should be able to indicate to the competition authorities that the competitive commercial environment is leading to buses racing on inner city roads and jostling for position and passengers at hotspots in our inner cities, with the consequent risks to passenger safety.</p>

It is important to the public&#151;particularly those who rely on public transport&#151;that buses work well, which for the most part means their offering a reliable and punctual service at a reasonable price. Where buses operate to their full potential, with the local authority and bus operators often in partnership, they offer a significant contribution to meeting national and local objectives. However, there are examples where, for whatever reason, bus networks are not fulfilling their potential and that some communities are missing out. That is one reason why we introduced the Local Transport Bill, about which I will say more later.</p>

Friend&#146;s constituency, it is perhaps worth giving a little bit of the background to put it in context. As my hon. Friend has said, bus services outside London have been deregulated for more than 20 years. The majority of such services are provided on a commercial basis, without subsidy. Bus operators, most of whom are in the private sector, can register services on routes on which they wish to operate, subject to fulfilling some basic requirements, such as being licensed to operate a bus service and providing a timetable.</p>

Such competition can benefit consumers through lower prices and improvements in the quality of the services being provided. There is no rule prohibiting big companies from competing with smaller companies: that happens in many markets. In some cases, a larger company&#146;s ability to offer lower prices may simply be due to their being more efficient. Competition legislation&#151;the Competition Act 1998&#151;prohibits conduct that amounts to the abuse of a dominant position, although it does not in itself prohibit the holding of a dominant position.</p>

- My hon. Friend makes a straightforward, logical point about market distortion, which may be subject to elements that are outside the local environment. A company&#146;s minor market share locally may not, as he says, mean that they are the smaller of the two operations, because it may be part of a much larger&#151;indeed, a national&#151;combine.

Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer) mentioned. Whether in respect of retail business or buses, we have to determine whether competition rules are being abused in such circumstances. That is the job of the Office of Fair Trading, to which allegations of anti-competitive behaviour should be directed.</p>

Stagecoach introduced high-frequency services with new low-floor buses and offered new ticket deals. Preston Bus responded by introducing low-floor buses of their own and began operations on traditional Stagecoach routes. On the face of it, that seems like good news for the consumer, but I recognise that there can be repercussions associated with intense competition for bus markets. Over-bussing routes, poor co-ordination of services and the absence of co-operation between operators can be detrimental to passengers, as my hon. Friend the Member for Preston said. That can also cause road safety and congestion problems.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="71127h0009.htm_para18"><a name="07112751000332">The traffic commissioners have powers to impose traffic regulation conditions, where requested by a local authority, to prevent danger to road users or to reduce severe traffic congestion. Where a TRC is in place, all bus operators in the area must comply with it. In this case, Lancashire county council, as the local highway authority, monitored the operation of the increased bus services and felt that the situation presented potential dangers to road users. In view of that, the council applied to the traffic commissioners to introduce a TRC to prevent buses from stopping other than to pick up or set down passengers at a number of locations in Preston. That TRC came into force on 30 July.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="71127h0009.htm_para19"><a name="07112751000333">Essentially, the aim of the TRC is to prevent buses from exceeding waiting times at bus stops in an attempt to get more passengers or block other buses. However, despite that TRC, I understand that the traffic commissioner is still receiving complaints regarding the operation of buses in Preston. The situation is being monitored. For instance, a recent survey was undertaken to assess compliance with the TRC. The commissioner is considering those complaints and whether regulatory action should be considered at a public inquiry. The county council is also holding regular meetings with representatives from both Preston Bus and Stagecoach to discuss the implications of the increased service on certain routes. There have  <br>

-<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="71127h0009.htm_para20"><a name="07112751000334">Action is being taken locally to look into the Preston situation. We are also taking action nationally to help to prevent such occurrences from becoming more widespread. A large part of the Local Transport Bill involves giving local authorities a better range of options to improve local bus services in their area. The Bill will provide more opportunities for quality partnerships, allowing them to specify minimum frequencies and maximum fares. Operators would have to be willing partners in that, but the negotiating hand of local authorities would be strengthened.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="71127h0009.htm_para21"><a name="07112751000335">In particular, the potential for partnership between local authorities and multiple bus operators would be improved, and experience shows that bus services work best when there are good relations between operators and local authorities. If the provision of bus services in local markets can be improved through partnership&#151;to the benefit of consumers&#151;the potential for future bus wars should be reduced. Bus wars might generate benefits in the short term, but they do not generally benefit consumers in the longer term.</p>

Local authorities must still demonstrate that the public benefits will be large enough to justify considerable influence in the market.</p>

Some stakeholders have commented that the current legislation does not provide sufficient flexibility for traffic regulation conditions to be applied until after problems have actually arisen. We have concluded that it would be useful for traffic commissioners to have the power to impose TRCs in anticipation of future safety or congestion problems, rather than having to wait for such problems to occur before taking action. As now, a TRC would still have to be requested by a local authority. In addition, we have determined that the time is now right to provide a more visible and influential voice for the bus passenger. As my hon. Friend said, the Bill includes provisions to take that forward. We plan to issue a consultation paper shortly that will outline the detailed options.</p>

Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of sight loss in the UK and accounts for 57 per cent. of all certificated visual impairment and blindness in this country. Of the two types of age-related macular degeneration&#151;wet, and dry&#151;wet eye is the most virulent and can cause blindness in just a few months.

It is the latter stage that causes blindness. However, it also restricts independence in the elderly. In fact, only arthritis and heart disease cause greater functional impairment in the elderly in this country. The difference in the case of wet AMD, however, is that it can be treated in a way that allows sufferers to continue to enjoy their independence and their sight.</p>

Those drugs are called anti-VEGF, and they work by neutralising the agent that causes abnormal blood vessel growth and by reducing the fluid leakage from blood vessels that causes wet AMD. Avastin is another drug used to treat wet AMD. In cases in which the local NHS provides treatment, it is the drug most commonly used. Avastin is licensed for treatment of some cancers but is also effective &#147;off-label&#148; in treating wet AMD, and is cheaper than Lucentis or Macugen.</p>

The bad news is that treatment cannot be done on the NHS in their area, but if they go to the private hospital two miles down the road, they can be treated at &#163;1,100 per eye per injection and their sight can probably be saved.</p>

However, we are talking about elderly people who do not have thousands of pounds spare to save their sight. In any case, why should they have to fork out their hard-earned savings when other areas of the country prescribe anti-VEGF drugs freely? If my constituents lived in Southampton, Sheffield or Liverpool, they would be treated with sight-saving drugs on the NHS. Of course, if they lived in Scotland, I would not need to have this debate at all. The Scottish Medicines Consortium&#151;Scotland&#146;s equivalent to NICE&#151;has already approved the use of Lucentis and Macugen. Indeed, Lucentis and Macugen are approved for use and reimbursement across much of mainland Europe.</p>

That means that patients with wet AMD may be treated with photodynamic therapy in the first eye, which is a less effective treatment, if they meet the stringent criteria. Patients will not be treated with anti-VEGF drugs until they start losing their sight in the second eye. Again, they have to meet the east midlands&#146; exceptionally stringent regional criteria.</p>

By the time the decision is made, patients&#146; sight will have deteriorated considerably, or they could have gone blind. Such an alleged choice is in fact no choice at all. I suggest that that criterion, which was put in place only recently, was cobbled together solely to avoid patients suing the PCT. I believe that the decision is made not on clinical grounds but, sadly, on financial grounds.</p>

When someone goes to an optician, they are asked to read letters on a vision chart. Let us imagine the improvement to their quality of life if, after treatment, they could suddenly read three more lines on the vision chart.</p>

Mrs. Durrant contacted me after waiting for an unacceptably long time to hear whether she was eligible for treatment. Her consultant went through the correct procedure to try to get her treated with Lucentis on the NHS. He filled out all the necessary forms and sent them on to the East Midlands specialised commissioning group for its approval. After a long wait, Mrs. Durrant was told that she was not eligible for Lucentis treatment on the NHS because she did not meet the interim criteria. However, she was also told that the criteria were now being changed and she would be referred for a second opinion. Once again, the decision took an inordinate amount of time, but this time round with devastating consequences&#151;Mrs. Durrant went blind while waiting for a decision on her treatment.</p>

Costs for courses of treatment with Lucentis or Avastin vary greatly from hospital to hospital, but they are about &#163;500 to &#163;1,000 to the patient per injection. A course usually involves three injections of Avastin or six injections of Lucentis. Let us compare that to the hundreds of thousands of pounds that it costs to support someone who is registered blind. The state must support people who are registered blind with care in their daily lives. Why not save those costs and give back people&#146;s independence by spending just a fraction of the money that would be needed to care for a blind person and giving them sight-saving treatments when needed?</p>

Mrs. Marshall, a lovely lady, is the main carer for her disabled husband, who is in his 90s; they live independently. Mrs. Marshall cannot afford to go blind, as she has to give her husband 24-hour care. Although the authorities were well aware of her situation, the only option that they gave her was to pay privately for treatment. She was going blind in both eyes and had no choice but to pay for treatment so that she could continue to look after her husband.</p>

Had Mrs. Marshall not paid for treatment and gone blind, the state would have had to pay out hundreds of thousands of pounds, not only on her care but on her husband&#146;s as well. Of course, Mrs. Marshall did not want to go blind or to be a burden on the state, so she was forced to scrape together the money to save her sight. However, there is some good news to report. Whittlebury Hall hotel and spa in Northamptonshire heard of Mrs. Marshall&#146;s plight and has very kindly refunded the cost of her private treatment.</p>

Mrs. Waterer was the first of my constituents to approach me after being told that the local NHS would not treat her. She used her funeral savings to pay for her first injection of Avastin, and her family paid for the second injection. However, to complete the treatment, she needed three injections and she had no way of raising any money to pay for the final injection.</p>

Kettering general hospital, rather than the PCT, agreed to fund Mrs. Waterer&#146;s third injection and refunded her the money for her second injection. The reason why it agreed to fund the last parts of the treatment was that there was such a delay in making a decision on her case that she was losing her sight more rapidly day by day. Congratulations to the hospital for stepping in. However, it took a huge media campaign for that to happen. I can now report that, following her course of treatment, Mrs. Waterer has regained her sight. Imagine how many other people&#146;s sight could be saved if decisions were made on a clinical basis rather than one of cost.</p>

This year, Northamptonshire PCT was underfunded by &#163;38 million. Over the past four years, the Government have given local health care almost &#163;150 million less than the Government themselves say that it needs as a minimum. It is for that reason and that reason alone that sight-saving treatment in my area cannot be given on the NHS.</p>

Where PCTs are funded properly, sight-saving treatments are available; where PCTs are underfunded, such as in my area, sight-saving treatments are not available. Northamptonshire PCT must receive the level of funding that the Government say that it should receive, so that people in my area are not forced to go blind when their sight can be saved.</p>

Though her sight has deteriorated, she has now been told that the NHS will not fund her treatment because the criteria have changed since she was promised NHS treatment in May. She has been informed that she has to start losing the sight in her second eye before she will be eligible for NHS treatment. Mrs. Elderton cannot afford to pay for more sight-saving treatment privately. Moreover, my constituent was given a promise of treatment on the NHS, but now that the criteria have changed, that promise has been broken. That is just not acceptable.</p>

First, Northamptonshire PCT must be funded properly. Underfunding our local health service by &#163;150 million in the past four years has had a profound effect on the level of health care that my constituents receive compared with those in other parts of the country. Will she undertake to ensure that in future Northamptonshire PCT will be funded to the full level of the national capitation formula? Secondly, will she put pressure on NICE to make a decision quickly on prescribing Lucentis and Macugen on clinical, not financial, grounds? Thirdly, will she intervene with Northamptonshire PCT to make it mandatory for sufferers of wet AMD to be treated on the NHS with sight-saving treatments?</p>

If a nationalised health service is to have any point, the Government must have the power to step in and direct PCTs to undertake certain treatments, as they have correctly done in certain areas of cancer care. Will the Minister take up the sad cases of the constituents whom I have mentioned and of others in my constituency who have been affected?</p>

Understandably, there is a lot of interest in the subject. Not only has the hon. Gentleman undertaken energetic work on behalf of his constituents, but other hon. Members have mentioned the issue to me. Indeed, I have constituents who have mentioned it, too. There is a lot of interest, particularly surrounding the development of new treatments that potentially offer hope to more patients.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="71127h0010.htm_para17"><a name="07112751000372">In order to try to provide that best possible service to patients, we have a duty to ensure that new treatments used on the NHS are both clinically effective and cost-effective. I know that the hon. Gentleman would feel strongly about that. That is why NICE was set up in 1999. Before that, prescribing practice varied across the country and we still see variations. Through NICE, we are trying to ensure that guidance is issued that gives certainty, clarity and transparency to the national health service. We are trying to move away from different appraisals at local, regional and national levels, with different evidence being used, which can mean that different recommendations are given about access to treatment. It is about trying to ensure that we have coherent guidance.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="71127h0010.htm_para18"><a name="07112751000373">NICE was asked to consider the matter of wet AMD, which is complex. It has already recommended the use of photodynamic therapy to treat wet AMD in some patients, and all PCTs are funding that treatment in accordance with the guidance. NICE is currently appraising Lucentis and Macugen for the treatment of AMD. Its appraisal committee met on 14 November to consider the responses it has received from stakeholders on the additional economic modelling for the original appraisal. The hon. Gentleman talked clearly about some of the issues to do with the interdependencies between families and communities and about what needs to be taken into account. NICE is appraising the two treatments together. That makes it more complicated. It is difficult, and NICE has to get it right if we are to have clear guidance across the NHS in England about what works and what should be available to patients, as the hon. Gentleman and I both want.</p>

That means that the appraisal is more complex. The hon. Gentleman asked me to put pressure on NICE and to encourage it to make progress, while respecting its independence. I, too, want to see a conclusion as quickly as possible, as would all hon. Members. However, we want to see it done correctly because of the difficulties and the importance of the subject.</p>

-they believe it is the right treatment for their patient. The PCTs should be undertaking that. Guidance has been issued to the effect that decisions should not be based simply on cost. We have made it clear to the NHS that treatment should not be withheld simply because NICE has not issued guidance.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="71127h0010.htm_para21"><a name="07112751000376">The Department issued guidance on managing the introduction of new health care interventions in December 2006. It advises NHS organisations that until NICE has published final guidance on a treatment, NHS bodies should continue with local arrangements for introducing new technologies based on an assessment of the available clinical evidence. The hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned variations, which are part of the system that we are trying to rectify. We have given the clearest possible guidance to ensure that all the sources of information help PCTs to make the right assessment. I cannot put it any more strongly. The hon. Gentleman asked me to balance the local accountability and decision making of the health service with the knowledge and understanding of what it needs to provide to its population. Clear national guidance about the parameters in which that should be done is aimed at ensuring that we do not have a postcode lottery like the one that he described.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="71127h0010.htm_para22"><a name="07112751000377">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned Scotland. The Scottish Medicines Consortium approved Macugen and Lucentis and accepted them for use in the national health service in Scotland to treat wet AMD. Once NICE&#146;s appraisal of Macugen and Lucentis has been completed, and the guidance issued, it will supersede the guidance from the Scottish Medicines Consortium on Macugen. It is crucial, therefore, to make the right decision.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="71127h0010.htm_para23"><a name="07112751000378">Avastin is not licensed for the treatment of wet AMD, although it is used by some clinicians if patients agree. The companies involved in its making and distribution have no plans to seek a licence for its use in treating wet AMD, and no clinical trials have been conducted for that purpose. The hon. Gentleman may think that it is regrettable, but the Government have no power to make a manufacturer seek a licence for a particular drug, although clinicians can still prescribe it.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="71127h0010.htm_para24"><a name="07112751000379">The hon. Gentleman mentioned funding for his PCT. The 2007 comprehensive spending review continues a decade of unprecedented investment through a three-year settlement for the Department, which has increased the NHS budget by four per cent. a year in real terms. That takes the total funding from &#163;35 billion in 1997-08 to &#163;110 billion by 2010-11. I do not blame him for pressing his point about his PCT&#146;s funding, but he will know that the House has discussed the fact that other areas of the country are receiving considerably more than the funding formula recommendations. The Government inherited that situation.</p>

The hon. Gentleman understands the complexities of those finances and will appreciate that that process must be sensitive. It is not just a question of taking money away from an over-funded area and moving it somewhere else. I assure him, however, that the Government are taking action, and will continue to do so.</p>
