The inspirations for international women&#039;s day were the efforts of female American garment workers who staged protests against inhuman working conditions on 8 March 1857, and the women who in 1908 marched through New York demanding shorter working hours, better pay, the right to vote and an end   to child labour. Although we have come a long way on many of those issues, women in the United Kingdom still have concerns about equal pay and working hours, particularly the balance between paid working hours   and the even more precious, although unpaid,   hours that we spend outside work caring for our families.
