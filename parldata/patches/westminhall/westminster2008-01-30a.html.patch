  I am very pleased that we are having this debate today, but sad about the situation facing the people of Gaza at the moment, which is nothing short of a humanitarian crisis. A very large number of people are living&#151;or surviving&#151;with shortages of medicines, food and water and with regular cuts in electricity supplies. Much of this was debated last week during the Westminster Hall debate on the Foreign Affairs Committee report &#147;Global Security: The Middle East&#148;. I am pleased that we can return to this subject today, because I want to put a number of specific points to the Minister.</p>

Palliative care is a core service for patients&#151;it is not, and never has been, an optional add-on. If independent hospices cease to exist, the NHS will have no option but to pick up the slack. The Government should be acutely aware of that fact and address the funding shortfall while there is still time. We do not want excellent hospices such as St. Ann&#146;s and the others that have been mentioned today to be unable to continue because of short-sighted funding arrangements.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="80130h0008.htm_para3"><a name="08013060000308">We are all aware that hospices ask only for a level playing field; they want to be treated in the same manner as other NHS service providers. Hospices such as St. Ann&#146;s fulfil a necessary function in a society in which debilitating and life-threatening diseases such as cancer are sadly on the rise, and they do so in a manner that is truly laudable. They provide a unique and personal service that improves the quality of thousands of patients&#146; lives. They also support patients&#146; families and carers. When the Minister responds, I hope that he can tell us what action the Government intend to take to put right this desperate situation, and to ensure that hospices get the stable funding regime they so desperately require.</p>
