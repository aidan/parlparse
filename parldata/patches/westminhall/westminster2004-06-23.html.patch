-<p><a name="40623h03_spnew0"><b> Mr. Deputy Speaker </b>  (Mr. Frank Cook): Before we start our proceedings this afternoon, perhaps it would be helpful to point out that there is business in the parent Chamber today that is likely to incur several Divisions, as we all probably know. I give prior warning that the Chair will suspend for 15 minutes on each occasion, but a strict score of the time will be kept. Of course, penalty time&#151;or injury time, as we call it&#151;is allowed towards the end. We would normally finish at 4.30 pm, but the likelihood is that we will complete our business this afternoon somewhat later than that.
