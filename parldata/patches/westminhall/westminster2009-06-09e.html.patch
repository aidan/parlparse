 <p><a name="stpa_160"><a name="90609h0007.htm_para1"><a name="09060973000235">Part of the problem for police authorities is that they have no elected mandate. They raise and set taxes, but they are not directly accountable to the people from whom the taxes are raised. That probably allows the Government to do their worst in overruling the authorities&#146; ability to set priorities. I would like police authorities to have some form of directly elected mandate and nomination of local authority representatives. That would give them a much stronger hand and the ability to say to central Government, &#147;Don&#146;t interfere in what we&#146;re doing. We haven&#146;t only consulted; we have a direct mandate to be here and to set our own priorities and budget.&#148;</p>

Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes), I know that those in Derbyshire consulted heavily, yet central Government still overruled what the police authority was prepared to do. Some form of elected mandate would help a great deal.</p>

  Many hon. Members from Surrey have commented on the fact that Government inspectors have recognised that the Surrey police authority is very efficient in handling its finances and policing operations. The same is true in Derbyshire. Government inspectors say that Derbyshire is highly efficient and has made &#163;40 million in efficiency savings. Central Government are therefore saying to highly efficient police authorities, &#147;Even though you&#146;re very efficient and everybody across your county agrees with what you&#146;re doing in raising a bit more money out of council tax to make up for Government underfunding, we&#146;re going to cap you and stop you doing that.&#148; Where is the logic and the local accountability in that?</p>
