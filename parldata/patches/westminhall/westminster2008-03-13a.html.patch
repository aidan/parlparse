Member for Hendon, who I again congratulate on securing this debate. I also congratulate him and his colleagues in the Joint Committee on producing this report. I am sure that we will see some movement on the part of the Government, but there will still be too much prevarication and, as I see it, another attempt to find sufficient long grass to kick this issue into. I look forward to the Minister dispelling such a notion, which has obviously formed in my mind, and giving specific answers to the specific questions that I have posed. If, for any reason, he is not able to answer them today, I hope that he will be prepared to let us have some answers in writing.</p>

  I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) for his leadership of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and for his personal advocacy on behalf of some of the most vulnerable groups in our society. I have appeared before his Joint Committee to talk about the way in which the health and social care system treats older people and, recently, about the often unsatisfactory way in which it treats people with learning disabilities. Both of those inquiries have led to a sharper focus on the issues and, ultimately, will lead to significant cultural, regulatory and other changes to the way in which the health and social care system relates to older people and those with learning disabilities. He deserves tremendous personal credit, therefore, for championing unfashionable causes.</p>
