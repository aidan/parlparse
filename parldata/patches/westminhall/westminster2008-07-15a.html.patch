 <p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para5"><a name="08071578000199">What am I proposing this morning? I am saying that the status quo is not an option for the Tote, because it is haemorrhaging and we are losing good staff. Although it is important to get good returns for the taxpayer, it is highly debatable whether the Tote is actually an asset of the taxpayer. No one owned the Tote and it became a taxpayer concern only once we nationalised it. We paid nothing for it, so I do not know how the Treasury can sometimes argue that it belongs to the taxpayer. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The hon. Member for Tewkesbury is laughing. I was the one who brought the Tote into public ownership, but we now need to look at how we can develop it in the interests of racing, the UK and the punter.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="80715h0006.htm_para6"><a name="08071578000200">As I have said, under my proposals, the Treasury would get its deal, and I have answered the issue on state aid. Racing would get a good income stream, both in the short and medium term, and we could continue to build jobs. I believe that, if we want to, we can resolve the issue of the levy and bring it into the new Tote trust. That would give clear funding streams for sport on the one hand, with good governance by the BHA on the other. I think that the sport would be fit for purpose. Considering that the UK horse racing sport and industry is revered around the world, there would be a major step forward, and I hope that the proposal will be taken seriously and that we can collectively put it together and deliver for sport.</p>

  May I congratulate the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central on securing this most timely and important debate? Racing is certainly at a crossroads, particularly with regard to funding. I agree with his points on Europe and will return to that issue in a few minutes.</p>
