 service, which are all very important issues. However, I, for one, feel very passionately about agriculture, because I represent a very agricultural constituency. It frustrates me greatly that the Government spend so little time talking about the huge damage&#151;the crisis&#151;that farming communities such as those in the Shrewsbury area are facing.</p>

He is one of the most honourable people that I have ever come across. He works very hard to make a living and shows immense fortitude and courage, no matter what is thrown at him. I want the Minister to assure me that Mr. Balmer will receive his payments on time next year and, more importantly, that she is going to do something that shows that she really understands the terrible suffering of my community, which is so dependent on the vibrancy of the agricultural sector. Furthermore, I want her to assure me that she will take on board the recommendations of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and use her many talents and skills to convince the Treasury that the time has come for the extra investment that is needed to sort out bovine TB in this country once and for all, so that we can save the hundreds of millions of pounds that we will otherwise have to spend if the crisis is not dealt with.</p>

  First of all, I want to apologise for the fact that the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw), who has the topic of bovine TB in his brief, is unable to be here today and that I am therefore addressing hon.
