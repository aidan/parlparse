 <p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para26"><a name="09061057000041">I see suppliers regularly, as we all do, and I decided to check specifically the three suppliers to whom I have recently had access. The best illustration of the problem is provided by Scottish Power, which paradoxically supplies fuel to some members of my family in Wales. It has sent out a booklet, dated September 2008, entitled, &#147;Prices: Your domestic gas and electricity pricing information&#148;. The booklet does not have page numbers but it has many pages of information describing a &#147;Single Rate&#148;, a &#147;Two Rate&#148;, a &#147;Domestic &#145;S&#146;&#148; rate, an &#147;Economy 7&#148; rate and a &#147;White Meter No. 1¥&#148; rate&#151;one has to check what that sign means. As well as those five electricity rates, there is a daily service charge, a price for &#147;All/Day kWh&#148;, a separate night rate, and prices without and with VAT.</p>
 
-<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="90610h0001.htm_para27"><a name="09061057000042">The booklet then gives all the different package payment options. One can have a &#147;Premier Plus Package&#148;, paying monthly by direct debit or standing order, a &#147;Standard Package&#148;, paying quarterly by direct debit, cash, cheque or postal order, a &#147;Weekly Payment Package&#148;, paying weekly by payment book or card, or a &#147;Prepayment Package&#148;, paying as one uses a prepayment meter. If that is not enough, one can have a &#147;Premier Plus Package&#148;, paying monthly by direct debit or standing order for gas, or a &#147;Standard Package&#148; for gas with different payment options. There are then standing charge options for gas and some packages that have no standing charges. In the second half of the booklet, there are more categories for standing charge options, including a &#147;ComfortPlus Control&#148; rate, a &#147;ComfortPlus White Meter&#148; rate, a &#147;Domestic &amp; Economy 2000&#148; rate, a &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak C&#148; rate, &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak 2‡&#148; rate, a &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak A‡&#148; rate and a &#147;Domestic &amp; Off Peak D‡&#148; rate. I am only halfway through the booklet, but I think you get the idea, Mr. Russell.</p>
