 <p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80617h0010.htm_para11"><a name="08061768000385">As my hon. Friend said, the council is considering compulsory purchase action in Girnhill. I know that he, on behalf of his constituents, is somewhat impatient at the pace of that development. However, he will recognise that it would be wrong of me to comment on the specific detail of the regeneration scheme, as it may prejudice any future quasi-legal decision by the Secretary of State.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="80617h0010.htm_para12"><a name="08061768000386">In conclusion, I again pay tribute to my hon. Friend&#146;s work on behalf of his constituents in respect of regeneration, employment, training, jobs and housing. I am sorry that I am somewhat restricted in saying more about the prospects of impending compulsory action, but I am sure my hon. Friend understands that restriction. I am confident that with his strong local leadership and his ability to bring people together, a satisfactory resolution can be found soon to enable the Girnhill regeneration to proceed. I hope that I have reassured him that this Government are committed to supporting mining communities such as Featherstone and Girnhill in his area and elsewhere through change, including turning around housing market failings where they exist.</p>
