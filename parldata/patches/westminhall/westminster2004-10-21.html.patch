Friend points to an important aspect of the Government&#039;s plans for providing, among other things, extended child care facilities, and for using schools as a mechanism for delivering some type of social cohesion in the neighbourhood. If schools in areas where there are segregated communities just replicate the segregation, we will not certainly achieve what the Select Committee report encourages us to do: reduce social exclusion.

 <p><a name="41021h01_spnew22"><b> Mr. Hayes </b> : I take the hon. Lady&#039;s point about post offices. She is right that urban post office closures have been a real concern across the country. I suppose that the response to her point was embedded in the point itself when she said that access to facilities in rural areas is often more difficult simply because of where people live and the sparsity of services. That is exacerbated for the most vulnerable citizens. Half of rural parishes do not have a bus services. Many villages in my constituency do not have one. People are particularly disadvantaged if they do not own a car, or cannot share one or get a lift, and if their village has no shop&#151;as a number of my villages do not&#151;no church and none of the facilities that I have described as being some of the vital components in building community life and delivering social cohesion.
