  Passenger services on the Thames are a matter for Transport for London (TfL) and the Mayor. However, the Department is always ready to engage with the Mayor and TfL on issues of this nature. The Department is also ready to engage with the Mayor on freight traffic; although this is not his exclusive remit.</p>
