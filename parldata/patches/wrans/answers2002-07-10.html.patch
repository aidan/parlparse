  The national health service taskforce on staff involvement was established in 1998 to look at successful approaches to involving front-line staff and make recommendations to Ministers. It was disbanded once their report had been submitted to Ministers. The taskforce included thirteen representatives from across the NHS, a trade union and the private sector. The taskforce met the then Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), in July 1999 at the launch of the taskforce's report on staff involvement. The Department is currently working with the Modernisation Agency, the unions and NHS trusts to implement the recommendations of the report.
