  <i>[holding answers 22 October 2002]:</i> The implementation of section 49 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 relates to National Health Service funded nursing care, not free continuing care. The guidance states that patients should have their need for registered nursing care reviewed and re-assessed three months after their placement in a nursing home; at least annually thereafter, or when there is a significant change in their condition. Entitlement to local NHS continuing health care criteria is the first consideration in any assessment by NHS nurses. I have received several representations in relation to the implementation of section 49.
