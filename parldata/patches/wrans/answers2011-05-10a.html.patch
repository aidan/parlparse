                <b>Mr Davey:</b>
  I and my officials work very closely with the Department of Health on the application of the Working Time Directive to the UK Healthcare sector, meeting as appropriate. This directive is once again being considered by the European Commission and both Departments agree that we should pursue discussions in Europe with the intention of maintaining the individualâ€™s right to opt-out of the 48 hour working week while seeking greater flexibility particularly in the areas of on-call time and compensatory rest. This strategy is in-keeping with the commitment in the coalition agreement to work to limit the application of the Working Time Directive.</p>
