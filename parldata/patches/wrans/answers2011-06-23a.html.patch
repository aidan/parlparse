  Back-up electricity generation, which may be required as a result of low wind output, as well as for several other reasons, is provided by other generation, which includes coal, gas and hydro. Non-generation approaches (demand response, interconnection and storage) also provide back-up. As we decarbonise the electricity system further, these non-generation approaches are expected to play proportionately more of a role as they can often facilitate integration of intermittent generation more effectively than back-up generation.</p>
