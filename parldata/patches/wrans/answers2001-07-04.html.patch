 <a name="10704w17.html_para5">During my last visit to China in October 2000, I discussed a number of issues with the Chinese Government, including human rights. My Department's main concern is to help those people in all parts of China who live in abject poverty. Since 1978, China has experienced a remarkable reduction in poverty, and continues to achieve impressive social indicators, for example low child mortality and high rates of enrolment in primary education. There has been a significant improvement in respect for the economic and social rights of the poor in China. We will continue to press the case for more progress on civil and political rights.
