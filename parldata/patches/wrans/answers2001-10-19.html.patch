 <a name="11019w02.html_para1">As the Prime Minister told the House on 8 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 811, since the events of 11 September our civil defence arrangements have been under active scrutiny and review. Plans are in place to protect our key facilities and utilities. As Chair of the Civil Contingencies Committee, I have drawn together key Departments, the devolved Administrations, the police and the security service to drive this work forward. For reasons of security, the Government's contingency plans are not publicised but we will keep the House informed of any major development which concerns public safety and a number of Departments have already issued guidance to key individuals and organisations.
