  The European Commission approved the UK areas eligible for regional state aid in July 2000; these were then implemented through the Assisted Areas Order 2000. The European Commission approval lasts until the end of 2006; the Government are not planning to review the assisted areas until it is necessary to develop proposals for the subsequent period.
