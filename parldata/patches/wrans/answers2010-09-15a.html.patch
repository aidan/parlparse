 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years). In particular improvements in how 'bariatric surgery' is coded, with the introduction of new codes in various versions of the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), growth due to better recording of procedures should not be misinterpreted as growth solely due to increases in activity.<br>
  These data should not be described as a count of people as the same person may have been admitted on more than one occasion. Also it is not possible to get a total 'bariatric surgery' figure from this data, as adding the types of 'bariatric surgery' together may include double counting, as a patient may have more than one type of 'bariatric surgery' within the same year.<br>
