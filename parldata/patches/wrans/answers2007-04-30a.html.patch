- To date there has not been a formal system for assessing the impact of immigration on public services but individual Government Departments have mechanisms to receive information about overall pressures on such services. Last summer we conducted a cross-Government review of the impacts of migration. On 28 March we announced the establishment of a new forum to provide an opportunity for regular and organised dialogue with interested parties focusing on the impacts of migration. This will be chaired by Home Office and Local Government Ministers.</p>

- The National DNA database is a key police intelligence tool which contributes to the efficiency of crime detection. It has a key role to play in contributing to detection outcomes, eliminating the innocent from inquiries, focusing the direction of inquiries resulting in savings in police time and in building public confidence that elusive offenders may be detected and brought to justice.</p>
