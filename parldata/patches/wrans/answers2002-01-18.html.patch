  Mr. Stonborough was engaged with effect from 20 December 2001 to provide the House of Commons Commission with advice on media relations generally, and on long-term information strategy. The commission chose him at its meeting on 18 December 2001. The need for a corporate approach to media matters was identified in the Braithwaite Review of Management and Services (HC745) published in July 1999. This led to the appointment of a communications adviser in the Office of the Clerk in 2000. Mr. Stonborough's engagement represents a further step in that direction.
