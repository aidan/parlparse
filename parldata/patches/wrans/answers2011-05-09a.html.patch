  The Department scrutinises all measures, as part of the flow of regulation, to identify outs, for the one-in, one-out regulatory management system. This is a continuous process. The Department is leading the “Healthy living and social care” theme of the Red Tape Challenge, launched by the Prime Minister on 7 April 2011 and is actively reviewing its stock of regulation, impacting business and civil society organisations. This theme goes live on the Red Tape Challenge website on 23 June.</p>
