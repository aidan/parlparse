 <sup>(20)</sup> Comparisons across years may not be valid due to changes in the method of reporting the information. In particular, the outturn data for 1996&#150;97 to 2002&#150;03 have been calculated on a non-FRS (Financial Reporting Standard) 17 basis while the outturn data for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 have been calculated on an FRS 17 basis. Hence, figures for different years may not be directly comparable.<br>
