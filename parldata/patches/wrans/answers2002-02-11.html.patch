  I understand from the Commissioner that staff absences accounted for the inability of police in Brixton to accept reports of minor crime over the telephone for the period concerned. A decision was made to use the available staff to ensure continuity of service in the Crime Management Unit. Leaving the Crime Management Unit inadequately staffed would have had a greater adverse effect on the investigation of crime. Throughout this period members of the public were able to report minor crime in writing or in person at police stations.
