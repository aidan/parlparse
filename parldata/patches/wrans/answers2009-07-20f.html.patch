 The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>
