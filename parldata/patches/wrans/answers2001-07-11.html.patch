 <a name="10711w04.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
  HMG's policy is that those territories which choose to remain British should abide by the same standards of human rights that British people expect of their own Government. These are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and the six core UN human rights instruments. The ECHR and most of the UN Conventions have been extended to all the territories. We are working with the territories to complete the process of extending the outstanding UN Conventions. The territories to which these conventions have already been extended are in large measure compliant.
