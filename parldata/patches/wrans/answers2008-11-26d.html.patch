  The Cabinet Office paper in the House Library &#147;Machinery of Government: economy, business, climate change, energy and environment&#148; sets out much of this information, including that the Department of Energy and Climate Change will sponsor the Carbon Trust, Energy Savings Trust and Ofgem. There are ongoing negotiations to determine the overall functions of the Department and which additional regulators, inspectorates, Executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) might become the responsibility of the Department. Once these are completed, they will be a matter of public record. The final budget for DECC and its NDPBs will be agreed once negotiations on the machinery of government changes with BERR and DEFRA are complete.</p>
