-Cairns:</b> The Department for Regional Development&#146;s
-Roads Service promotes cycling in Northern Ireland from two
-perspectives. Firstly, it continues to invest some &#163;800,000 per
-annum on the cycling infrastructure to improve facilities for cyclists
-and to make cycling as safe as is possible. This includes the creation
-of further cycle lanes (both traffic free and on-road); the provision
-of town centre bicycle parking facilities; and the installation of
-toucan crossings for cyclists at key points on the
-network.</p><p><a name="06072811000489">Secondly,
-through its annual Northern Ireland Travelwise initiative, Roads
-Service promotes a series of highly marketed cycling events during
-National Bike Week. This year Bike Week took place from 17-25 June 2006
-when some 400 cyclists participated in events across Northern Ireland.
-I understand that there are plans to organise further cycling events in
-the years ahead.</p><p><a name="06072811000490">In
-partnership with the NI tourist board, the Environment and Heritage
-Service and the Health Promotion Agency, Roads Service co-funds a
-project to promote all types of cycling across Northern Ireland. As a
-result &#145;Cycle Northern Ireland&#146; was established in 2005
-and currently employs a dedicated marketing team whose aim is to
-promote cycling for the domestic/out of state markets; to raise
-awareness of the product available; and to encourage cycling as a mode
-of transport and as a leisure pursuit.</p><br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 1405W</b><br><p><a name="06072811000491">Additionally, Roads Service in

-to extend the National Cycle
-Network.</p><p><a name="06072811000493">The RDP has
-also provided approximately &#163;113,000 of funding to the
-Countryside Access and Activities Network to develop cycling trails on
-DARD&#146;s Forest Service properties at Castle Archdale Forest, Co
-Fermanagh, Gosford Forest Park, Co Armagh and Castlewellan Forest Park,
-Co Down and a further &#163;42,000 has been allocated to Fermanagh

-a series of family trails; cross-country trails; and downhill trails at
-a variety of sites across Northern Ireland. These will provide cyclists

-January 2004 the Department issued comprehensive guidance to schools on
-drugs (Drugs: Guidance for Schools) which included a clear statement
-about the importance of educating young people about the legal status
-and harmful effects of cannabis. We have continued to expand the
-Personal, Social and Heath Education (PSHE) continuing professional
-development programme, which includes standards for the teaching of
-drug education. Over 5,000 teachers and community nurses have benefited
-from this programme. The numbers of schools involved in the Healthy
-Schools Programme, which requires schools to have a PSHE programme
-including drug education, continues to rise. We are on track to reach
-our target of half of all schools being healthy schools by the end of
-2006. In conjunction with the Home Office and Department of Health we
-have concluded the implementation of the Blueprint drug education
-research programme and are now analysing the research findings.
-Blueprint was set up to evaluate an evidence-based multi-component
-programme of drug education at Key Stage 3. From September secondary
-schools will have access to a new resource. &#145;Understanding
-Drugs&#146; provides information on a range of drugs, including
-cannabis, for pupils aged 11-14 and suggestions for teaching and
-learning activities within the

-light bulbs, the new factors were the use of an average saving across
-different bulb wattages and different bulb types; recognition that most
-households were now likely to have at least one compact fluorescent
-lamp, most probably in the most heavily-used light fitting, so the
-annual hours of use for new installations would now be shorter than
-before (thereby reducing the annual savings); and allowance for the

-insulation, monitoring projects had indicated that actual energy
-savings were rather lower than expected from models. Additionally, in
-practice, the extent of the fillable cavity was somewhat smaller than
-the external wall area. Pending the outcome of further monitoring, the
-energy (and carbon) savings were slightly reduced. DEFRA has a

-from continental Europe carrying the substances which form ground-level
-ozone, can produce summer smog in London. Ground-level ozone is formed
-when sunlight acts on nitrogen dioxide and other atmospheric substances
-close to the ground. The pollutants that cause ground-level ozone come
-from a range of sources, including petrol and other
-fuels.</p><p><a name="06072811005835">Ozone is a
-transboundary pollutant (around 50 per cent. of ozone-forming chemicals
-in the UK originate from continental Europe). It can only be reduced
-through national and international measures to reduce emissions from
-the source pollutants. Through international co-operation, the peak
-levels of ozone have been reduced due to control measures taken in the
-UK and its European partners. While still a feature of hot sunny
-weather, the peak levels seen in 2003 were typically less than half
-those seen in 1976.</p><br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 1512W</b><br><p><a name="06072811005836">New measures announced in recent

-II would, by 1 January 2010, be required to be installed at: (i) all

-for a vehicle protected against blast and explosively formed projectile
-attack from below and small arms, fragmentation and some blast from the
-side 14 second-hand Mamba vehicles were bought in three batches through
-the Urgent Operational Requirements process between 1996-99. Six were
-bought in 1996 for the NATO implementation force mission in Bosnia;
-three were procured in 1999 for operations in Macedonia; and a further

-vehicle was delivered to the Ministry of Defence following modification

-mines. This modification was included in the purchase cost. The extra
-weight of the appliqu&#233; armour was found to overload the Mambas
-and caused reliability and safety problems. The high level of
-maintenance required to keep the vehicles operational was exacerbated
-by a lack of commonality between the individual vehicles and poor
-availability of spares. In May 2001, due to road safety issues, their
-use was restricted to operational situations where there was a
-significant threat of minestrikes. Since the current version of the

-information is as
-follows:</p><p><a name="06072811008073"><i> (a)</i> As the
-Financial Assistance Scheme has only recently been set up, estimates of
-the administrative costs over the next 10 years are subject to a degree
-of uncertainty. Our current estimate is that it will cost around
-&#163;4.5 million a year up to 2009-10, when we would expect the
-costs to reduce significantly once the eligibility of all schemes and
-members has been
-assessed.</p><p><a name="06072811008074"><i> (b)</i> It is
-difficult to estimate the administration costs of a scheme providing
-restoration of pensions to all those covered by the parliamentary
-ombudsman's report. As the scheme might have to mirror the benefit
-structures for each qualifying pension scheme, it could be
-significantly more complex than the Financial Assistance
-Scheme.</p><p><a name="06072811008075">For full
-restoration, we estimate that the one off set up costs might be around
-&#163;10 million and during the first five years that it might take
-to assess scheme eligibility and calculate member benefits, the
-administration costs could be at least &#163;14 million a year. The
-total costs over the first year or so could therefore be around
-&#163;20 million.</p><p><a name="06072811008076">We

-Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 require
-employers to provide reasonable temperatures in all indoor workplaces,
-including offices, for their employees. These Regulations are
-accompanied by an Approved Code of Practice and guidance. HSE
-recommends a lower temperature of 16 degrees Celsius unless the work

-at least 13 degrees
-Celsius.</p><p><a name="06072811008083">There is no

-Establishing either is impractical, as thermal comfort is dependent on
-a range of environmental and personal factors (e.g. 
-<br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 1570W</b><br>ventilation, humidity, type of work activity being undertaken, clothes

-guidance is available on HSE's website
-www.hse.gov.uk/temperature/thermal. The website has been designed to
-provide comprehensive information and a step-by-step approach to help
-employers and employees manage excessive temperatures in the workplace.
-There is also HSE guidance for employers entitled &#147;Thermal
-comfort in the workplace&#148; (HSG
-194).</p><p><a name="06072811008085">The HSE has
-issued no specific health and safety guidance on public transport.
-However, HM Railway Inspectorate, which is now part of the Office of
-Rail Regulation, does have particular concern that rolling stock and
-infrastructure failures in deep tunnels can cause more specific health
-concerns. This is because of the increased temperatures and reduced
-ventilation that may be encountered by passengers on delayed and
-overcrowded carriages, especially during summer months. In such cases
-health and safety law requires employers to put arrangements in place
-to reduce the risks, but there are infrastructure and technical
-constraints to improving ventilation on some railways. Railway
-operators, such as LUL, alert passengers to the risks posed by hot
-conditions by suggesting that passengers carry a bottle of water and
-informing passengers of the quickest way of seeking help if taken ill
-on a train.</p><p><a name="06072811008086">In

-Towards a New Pensions System&#148; presents a coherent, interlinked

-component needs to be considered alongside the other reforms
-introduced.</p><p><a name="06072811008554">Under our

-provides a solid foundation for private saving. Incentives are further
-enhanced by reducing the growth of the savings
-credit.</p><p><a name="06072811008555">The White
-Paper also contains measures to simplify the state second pension,

-the problems created by worklessness is central to meeting our aim of

-have recently written to 45 local authorities, including Liverpool, to
-request expressions of interest (EOI) for our Cities Strategy which
-will bring public, private and voluntary sectors together into a
-concerted local programme to improve the way support for jobless people
-is co-ordinated and delivered. We are now considering all the EOIs and

-voluntary, community and private sectors to deliver initiatives to
-tackle worklessness. These include &#145;Step Closer 2 Work&#146;
-which is a programme to help those in receipt of incapacity benefits
-move closer to the labour market and the &#145;Diversity and Social
-Inclusion Project&#146; which aims to reduce worklessness by the
-provision of training and work experience. I was able to see some of
-the excellent work being done to tackle worklessness when I visited
-Liverpool Riverside last month. This included meeting the team running
-&#145;Streets Ahead&#146; which is a city wide initiative delivered
-by a number of partner agencies, aimed at helping disadvantaged people
-into work.</p><p><a name="06072811009245">In
-Liverpool, we undertook consultations with key partners around the
-introduction of our Pathways to Work programme, which has already shown
-significant success in getting people off incapacity benefits and into
-employment and was rolled out in Liverpool in April. Private and
-voluntary sector providers deliver and support a number of different
-programmes within our Pathways to Work pilots.</p><p><a name="06072811009246">In Liverpool, we hold
-bi-monthly meetings which are attended by a range of partners,

-over half a million empty private sector homes in England. More than
-half of these remain empty for longer than six months and a significant
-proportion are 
-<br><notus-date day="25" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>25 July 2006 : Column 1599W</b><br>abandoned for years. Empty homes can quickly fall into disrepair and the
-longer they remain empty the more likely it is that they will become
-derelict and prohibitively expensive to bring back into use. Empty
-homes can create significant problems for local authorities, the police
-and fire services. They blight the homes of neighbouring residents, are
-vulnerable to squatters, vandals, drug-dealers and arsonists, are bad
-for the environment and restrict housing opportunities available to
-people in areas of high housing
-demand.</p><p><a name="06072811009279">Our policy
-response is to promote effective empty homes strategies by local
-authorities that emphasise opportunities to work with property owners
-to find solutions that allow their properties to be brought back into
-use. We encourage local authorities to offer incentives ranging from
-advice on selling and letting property to grants and leasing
-arrangements. We have also introduced a range of fiscal incentive for
-owners of empty properties through VAT, capital allowances and council
-tax.</p><p><a name="06072811009280">We consider that
-local authorities must, as a last resort, have access to effective
-enforcement procedures for long term empty properties where voluntary
-measures have been declined and owners cannot demonstrate that they
-intend to bring their properties back into use. Local authorities have
-access to compulsory purchase procedures to deal with empty homes and
-may enforce the sale of properties on which they have carried out
-works. We have recently introduced Empty Dwelling Management Orders as
-an alternative solution that protects the rights of property
-owners.</p><p><a name="06072811009281">We work
-closely with the Empty Homes Agency, which is an independent charitable
-organisation that seeks to find effective solutions to the problems
-posed by empty homes. The Agency works closely with local authorities
-and has recently published guidance on setting effective empty homes
-strategies.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06072811000328">Fire

-different aid instruments to assist developing countries implement
-their national health plans. UK support ranges from direct budget
-support to funding delivered through multilateral agencies such as the
-World Health Organisation (WHO) and
-UNICEF.</p><p><a name="06072811009786">The focus of
-DFID&#146;s work in health is to help countries strengthen their
-health systems to prevent and mitigate the impact of ill health
-including communicable diseases. Functioning systems are crucial for
-effectively tackling diarrhoeal diseases, pneumonia and vaccine
-preventable disease epidemics as well as HIV, TB and malaria and to
-deliver child and reproductive health services. With country partners
-DFID monitors improvements in health outcomes (e.g. reduced child
-mortality rates) or outputs (more children immunised against measles
-and fewer cases and deaths) rather than inputs targeting individual
-diseases. The exception is AIDS, where DFID does monitor spend against

-agencies.</p><p><a name="06072811009788">We are also
-supporting a number of innovative financing mechanisms to increase
-resources to tackle communicable diseases. For example, the

-was &#163;80 million (out of the &#163;363 million).
-Recording AIDS-specific expenditure requires careful analysis because
-there are a range of sectors which have an impact on the epidemic,
-including health, education, social development and good governance.
-There are also a range of instruments used to channel AIDS-related
-development spending. DFID has been working with the Joint United

-swimming pools by London borough in each of the last five years is
-shown in the following table. The ISRM advise that all pools must
-provide some form of residual disinfection in the pool water to protect
-bathers against the risk of cross-infection. The UK is not alone in
-using chlorine for this purpose. It is probably the most effective
-disinfectant in water and this is the reason it is used throughout the

-Review, conducted by GFK NOP Social Research and published in April,
-showed that over a quarter of all adults in England were aware of the
-year, over 2.2 billion minutes were pledged by the public for
-volunteering (well exceeding the 1 billion minutes target) and over a
