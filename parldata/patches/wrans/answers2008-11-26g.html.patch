  Nuclear will be an important part of an affordable climate change policy for the UK. In the face of climate change and our 80 per cent. target, we need all low carbon energy technologies available in the mix. Not having nuclear as an option would increase the costs of delivering our energy goals and increase the risks of failing to meet our targets for reducing emissions. In the absence of nuclear power, and if carbon capture and storage is not a viable or technical option, the costs of generating the UK&#146;s electricity could increase by up to 40 per cent.</p>

  The Cabinet Office paper in the House Library &#147;Machinery of Government: economy, business, climate change, energy and environment&#148; sets out much of this information, including that the Department of Energy and Climate Change will sponsor the Carbon Trust, Energy Savings Trust and Ofgem. There are ongoing negotiations to determine the overall functions of the Department and which additional regulators, inspectorates, Executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) might become the responsibility of the Department. Once these are completed, they will be a matter of public record. The final budget for DECC and its NDPBs will be agreed once negotiations on the machinery of government changes with BERR and DEFRA are complete.</p>
