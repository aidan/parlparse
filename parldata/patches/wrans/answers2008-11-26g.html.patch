- Government student loans are not like commercial loans and are provided on generous terms with significant Government subsidy. The interest rate is linked to the rate of inflation (RPI) rather than to base rates. The borrower pays back the same amount in real terms as they borrowed.</p>

If earnings fall below this amount, repayments are suspended. The Student Loans Company update borrowers&#146; accounts annually after the end of each tax year, once they receive details from HMRC of the payments made through the tax system. Interest is then calculated on a daily basis, and borrowers are sent an annual statement of their loan account. The statement notifies borrowers of the current interest rate, which is also publicised on the SLC&#146;s website and through advertisements in the national press.</p>

This rate applied from September 2008, and was set at the rate of RPI for the year to March 2008. The interest rate has been set annually each September, using the same methodology, since student loans were first introduced in 1990. The interest rate for income contingent student loans, which were introduced in 1998, is also subject to an additional statutory limit: it cannot at any time exceed a rate of 1 per cent. above the highest of the base rates of a specified list of banks. The interest rate is set in accordance with regulations, and the SLC do not have any discretion in setting or altering the rate.</p>

  Nuclear will be an important part of an affordable climate change policy for the UK. In the face of climate change and our 80 per cent. target, we need all low carbon energy technologies available in the mix. Not having nuclear as an option would increase the costs of delivering our energy goals and increase the risks of failing to meet our targets for reducing emissions. In the absence of nuclear power, and if carbon capture and storage is not a viable or technical option, the costs of generating the UK&#146;s electricity could increase by up to 40 per cent.</p>

There are ongoing negotiations to determine the overall functions of the Department and which additional regulators, inspectorates, Executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) might become the responsibility of the Department. Once these are completed, they will be a matter of public record. The final budget for DECC and its NDPBs will be agreed once negotiations on the machinery of government changes with BERR and DEFRA are complete.</p>
