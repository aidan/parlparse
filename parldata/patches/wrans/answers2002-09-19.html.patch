- The fifth report (2000&#150;01) on the serious hazards of transfusion (SHOT) was published on 10 April 2002 and again indicated that blood transfusion in the United Kingdom is very safe, and amongst the safest in the world. Although the number of serious events reported, 315, had increased by 7.5 per cent. this must be seen against a total of over three million blood components transfused annually and increased participation in the scheme. Since the previous report, for 1999&#150;2000, participation in SHOT by National Health Service (NHS) trusts has increased from 72 per cent. to 92 per cent. of all hospitals. We will be looking to SHOT and the new national patient safety agency to help us take a more comprehensive approach to improving patient safety in the NHS.

To this aim, there are pilot projects looking to improve the identification of patients and issue of the correct blood. The results will help to inform future research and developments in this area to improve patient care.

This sets out a programme of action for the NHS to; ensure that Better Blood Transfusion is an integral part of NHS care. The guidance includes an objective to improve the safety of the blood transfusion process and calls on the NHS by December 2002, to ensure that policies on patient identification are in place, implemented and monitored throughout the blood transfusion process from prescription, sampling, laboratory testing and issue of blood to collection and administration of blood transfusion.
