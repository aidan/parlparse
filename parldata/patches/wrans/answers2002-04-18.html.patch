 <a name="20418w27.html_para0">DTI funded a pilot of the concept of post offices as Government General Practitioners (GGP)&#151;one-stop shops for information, advice and transactions with a range of government and other bodies&#151;which began last July and finished on 1 March this year. Together with other key stakeholders, we are now evaluating the outcome of the pilot to determine whether a national GGP service would meet the needs of citizens and participating organisations and provide value for money. The Department is also working with Post Office Ltd., the Office of the e-Envoy, other Government Departments and local government evaluating the design and costing of a potential national service. A decision on whether or not to proceed will be taken in the light of all the evidence.
