- Humanitarian conditions in the areas of Burma hit by Cyclone Nargis have improved significantly since access to international aid was opened at the end of May. DFID has contributed &#163;45 million to the relief effort. However, very many people in the Irrawaddy Delta remain highly vulnerable.</p>

- In a deteriorating humanitarian situation, five million people will rely on food aid by early 2009. Cholera risks are increasing, strained health services are collapsing and recent reports suggest only 40 per cent. of teachers present at school. Aid agencies are working to make the best of the next growing season. Zimbabwe will likely remain dependent on food aid for some time to come. DFID will spend &#163;44 million this year meeting basic needs.</p>

- The renewables obligation does not provide subsidies to licensed electricity suppliers but instead places an obligation on them to source a specific and annually increasing proportion of their sales from renewable sources. Suppliers meet their obligation either by presenting renewable obligation Certificates (ROCs); by paying a buy-out price; or a combination of presenting ROCs and paying the buy-out price. Money from the buy-out fund is recycled pro-rata to suppliers presenting ROCs.</p>

The Renewables Obligation Order places no restrictions on who may own or operate a generating station or hold a supply licence.</p>
