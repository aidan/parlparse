  Funding is available to all local education authorities through the standards fund (&pound;15.5 million in 2002&#150;03) for drug education. Part of the funding, &pound;1.3 million in 2002&#150;03 was set aside to extend the drug, alcohol and tobacco education training package, which aims to support teachers in planning, delivering and monitoring effective drug education by learning from and with other teachers, through teacher observations and collaborative enquiry supported by teaching networks.
