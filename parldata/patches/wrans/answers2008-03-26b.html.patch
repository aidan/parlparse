  We announced in the Planning white paper &#147;Planning for Sustainable Communities&#148; that we would review arrangements for statutory consultees on planning applications and would consult on proposals in due course. This work is being taken forward, our aim is to publish a consultation paper shortly. Meanwhile, as I mentioned in the reply I gave to the hon. Member on 17 July, we are committed to reducing the threshold for statutory consultation on the sale of playing fields from 0.4 ha to 0.2 ha and we will seek an opportunity to make the necessary amendment to the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995.</p>
