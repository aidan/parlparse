  The Government support the expansion of sport and leisure facilities through various means including direct funding from the Sports Lottery Fund, Space for Sports and Arts and the New Opportunities Fund. Our Plan for Sport sets out how we aim to encourage local authorities to carry out research into the existing sport and leisure facilities in their areas and recommends that each local authority should develop a sports strategy over the next five years which, through consultation with the relevant agencies, ensures that new and enhanced indoor and outdoor facilities provide equal opportunity for participation.

  <i>[holding answer 5 July 2001]:</i> The Government are committed to having immigration rules which are clear, firm and fair. We have no immediate plans for legislation but will keep the possible need for further change under review. We want to ensure that those who come and work here continue to make a major contribution to our economic and social life. We have transferred responsibility for the work permit system to the Home Office and will be looking further at the legal entry routes for people seeking to work in Britain. Officials are currently reviewing the Immigration Rules with the aim of producing a consolidated version which incorporates all changes made since HC395, the last main Statement of Changes. These revised Rules are likely to include a number of additions and amendments.
