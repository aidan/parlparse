  I refer the hon. Member to our 2 September 2008 statement on the package of measures responding to housing market conditions which confirmed that the social housing grant would be opened up to all stock-owning local authorities as well as local authorities with arms length management organisations. We are working with the Housing Corporation on the practicalities and the timetable for delivering this. No local authorities have applied for funding so far.</p>
