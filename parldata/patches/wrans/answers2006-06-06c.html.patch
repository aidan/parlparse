-for all new properties and new connections. Meters will also be offered
-to pensioner households. In the non-domestic sector, water charges will

-The affordability tariff will ensure that eligible low-income
-households spend no more than 3 per cent. of their income on
-water and sewerage charges. As many as 200,000 households (30 per cent.
-of all households) in Northern Ireland who presently qualify for rate

-should benefit from this scheme. The affordability tariff will also
-extend to all 16 to 17-year-old householders and to children leaving

-tariff will mean that no-one will pay more than &#163;180 regardless
