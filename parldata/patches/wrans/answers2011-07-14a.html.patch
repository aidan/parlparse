                <b>Alistair Burt:</b>
  Our overall objective is securing a more peaceful and stable Yemen, which presents a reduced risk to UK interests at home and in the region. Our work focuses on achieving a peaceful settlement to the current political stalemate; halting the country's decline into state failure; and working with the Yemeni authorities and others to disrupt Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's activities and operations. This is proving extremely difficult in the current volatile security climate in Yemen. Given our serious concerns about the security situation, we have drawn down our embassy to a small core team. That said, we continue to work with the Vice President and other key players in the Government and opposition to secure the political change that Yemen so badly needs. We continue to urge Vice President Hadi to engage with all sides to begin a peaceful political transition on the basis of the Gulf Co-operation Council agreement. We encourage all sides to participate in an inclusive dialogue as a way forward and to refrain from further violent clashes.</p>
