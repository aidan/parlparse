 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2006]: </i>The frequency of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) herd testing is determined by EU legislation but this does not establish the frequency of tests on individual cattle. In Great Britain, cattle herds are tested every one, two, three or four years depending on how widespread bTB is in their respective regions; these frequencies are reviewed on an annual basis. The percentage of herds and parishes being tested annually has increased over the last few years; currently, about 25 per cent. of herds are tested annually and another 14 per cent. are tested every two years. In 2005, approximately 43,500 herd tests were carried out on 4.85 million cattle.</p>

 preliminary work showed that 71 per cent. to 85 per cent. of the cattle included in the study appeared not to have been bTB tested during their lifetimes. However, it should be noted that the study included cattle which had lived through the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak when bTB testing was severely disrupted.</p>

  Child care costs are affected by a number of factors, such as the availability of child care provision, local wage levels, or land or rental prices where child care is offered. The child care element of the working tax credit has had a significant impact on the affordability of child care for low to moderate-income families, reducing the proportion of child care costs that they pay. Through the child care element of the working tax credit, working parents receive financial assistance with up to 80 per cent. of the costs of registered and approved child care, up to a maximum of £300 per week (£175 for one child). In April 2006 374,000 families were benefiting from the child care element, and they were receiving an average of £50 per week towards their child care costs.</p>

  We have no plans to review the Government’s guidance “Safeguarding Children in Whom Illness is Fabricated or Induced (2002)”. Consequently, we have not discussed review of the guidance with any other Departments. This guidance was produced jointly by the Department of Health, Home Office, Department for Education and Skills and the Welsh Assembly. It is intended to provide a national framework within which agencies and professionals at local level—individually and jointly—draw up and agree upon their own more detailed ways of working together in cases of fabricated or induced illness. It is addressed to those who work in the health and education services, the police, social services departments, the probation service, and others whose work brings them into contact with children and families.</p>

  There is scope in the Personal Social and Health Education framework for schools to explore issues such as parental separation and divorce. Since 2003, we have been providing training for teachers of PSHE through the PSHE certificate for teachers, from which over 5,000 teachers have so far benefited. In addition, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has produced a package of guidance for teachers of PSHE. This package includes units of work which can be used to address issues of divorce and separation.</p>

  Since the introduction of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) schools programme in 1953 the epidemiology of tuberculosis has changed from a disease of the general population to one predominantly affecting high-risk groups. The new recommendations are based on the advice of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation and are aimed at delivering an improved targeted risk based programme. The widespread introduction of targeted BCG vaccination means that the majority of children at high risk of tuberculosis will now be vaccinated in early life.</p>
