  After the 2001 general election, House departments provided a fuller and more co-ordinated induction process for newly elected Members than at any previous election. It is known that virtually all newly elected Members attended the Reception Area and associated activities. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that these activities were well received, but in addition the Board of Management has agreed that there should be a small survey of newly elected Members in order to seek their opinions in a more systematic way. The group of House officials who oversaw the process has made its own assessment, including points for consideration when preparations are being made for the induction process after the next general election.
