 The Chancellor and other Treasury Ministers receive regular representations from across the business community on many issues and we value their insights. The Government fully appreciate that the weakness of the euro, together with a sharp slowdown in the world economy last year, has made conditions difficult for tourism and other exporting industries.

 The UK continues to work hard to ensure that the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative delivers an exit from unsustainable debt for eligible countries. We also call on other countries to follow our leads on bilateral policies, such as 100 per cent. relief at decision point, and in holding payments in trust for those countries yet to receive debt relief. Already 25 countries have qualified for debt relief, and they will benefit from over $60 billion in debt reduction, which will bring their debts to below the developing countries average.
