 <a name="20515w10.html_para4">The recent Israeli re-occupation has moved the issue of damage and assessment to an entirely different scale. A detailed damage assessment is being conducted by the international agencies. A joint World Bank/UNSCO (UN Special Co-ordinator's Office) paper is due to be circulated by 13 May, and follow-up action discussed at a local aid co-ordination committee meeting later next week. EU contribution to reconstruction efforts will be considered there (from the Commission and from member states).
