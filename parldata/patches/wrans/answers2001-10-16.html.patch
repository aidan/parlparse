 <a name="11016w12.html_para2">We have not had direct discussion with petrol companies on their contributions to the cost of bilking at petrol stations, although officials have regular contact with the British Oil Industry Security Syndicate (BOSS) which is made up of representatives of petrol companies. BOSS has instigated the "Forecourt Watch" scheme which aims to reduce the types of crime that affect petrol station forecourts. There are 40 schemes currently operating across the United Kingdom and BOSS continues to develop new schemes in co-operation with local police services.
