 <a name="20430w11.html_para10">My Department also continues to work internationally to promote a more favourable environment for sustainable poverty reduction in developing countries. At both the World Trade Organisation Conference in Doha and the UN Financing for Development Conference in Monterey, agreement was reached on the nature of the partnership between developed and developing countries. Developing countries have committed to actions on good governance and the creation of a domestic enabling environment. Developed countries have committed to support these efforts with action on aid volume, aid effectiveness, building capacity, investment and competition. We are contributing to preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August to help ensure better understanding of the links between poverty reduction and globalisation, and more effective management of environmental resources.
