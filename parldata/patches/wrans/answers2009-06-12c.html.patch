Many Jobcentres therefore will have less than 50 employees and instead will establish posts (or jobs) that cover a range of these roles and responsibilities in a variety of permutations. Each manager will in turn set an individual set of objectives for each job holder. Similarly, non operational jobholders within functions such as Projects, Finance and Planning cover roles that are also not standard. Many of these jobholders will necessarily have individual descriptions. This variety and volume of jobs means that a description of every job in every grade is not available.</p>

One of the criteria we look for is an understanding of the range and detail of support available through external partners.
