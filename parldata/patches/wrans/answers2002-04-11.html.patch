It is a prime feature of delegated line management responsibility to operate procedures protecting assets from theft and damage. These procedures are always subject to review. They are enhanced where possible through central initiatives directed at the deterrence and detection of fraud and theft and the introduction of resource accounting arrangements. Recent developments include the promulgation of a policy statement on fraud and theft and the development of a programme of fraud and theft awareness training across the department. Key controls, such as the maintenance of asset registers requiring a physical description of assets, spot checks and random searches, authorisation to remove assets from sites and physical security are underpinned by published guidance and direction.

 Substantial progress has been made, since the onset of the volcanic crisis, in returning normality to life in the northern half of the island. Basic infrastructure and essential public services have been restored; housing has been provided for those in need; and a range of expertise has been supplied in support of Montserrat's efforts to recover from the crisis. The focus now is upon sustainable development and eventual return to self-sufficiency for the island. With this in mind, a new airstrip and measures to attract specialist tourism and private sector investment are under consideration. A new volcano monitoring facility, incorporating special viewing areas for visitors, will be commissioned later this year. The volcano, now scientifically classifed as "persistently active", continues to pose a threat to the southern half of the island, including the former capital town of Plymouth. These areas remain uninhabitable. The risk to northern areas of the island is presently judged to be negligible.

 I refer my hon. Friend to my reply of 9 January 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 837W. DFID has been funding two bilateral projects in Cameroon with significant elements relating to bushmeat. From 1995&#150;2002, the Mount Cameroon Project team worked closely with the Cameroon Ministry of Environment and Forests to establish field level community management of timber and wildlife resources. The Community Forestry Development Project in Cameroon continues to work up these and other field projects into ways for communities to manage their wildlife resources under the Forest Law.
