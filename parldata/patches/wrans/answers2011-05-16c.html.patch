                <b>Mr Willetts:</b>
  The Department has in recent times invested significant funding in a number of centres via the Strategic Investment Fund. These centres include the National Renewable Energy Centre, Wave Hub, the Centre for Process Innovation, and the National Composites Centre, and these have been the primary focus of our direct discussions. Officials across this Department also have formal and informal contacts with a number of centres in the context of their work although there is no formal record of these interactions.</p>
