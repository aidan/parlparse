  Overpayments to a value of &#163;51 million have been written off since tax credits were introduced. Of this around &#163;37 million was written off following the identification of a software error that affected some 455,000 households in April and May 2003. The background to this is explained in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General 2003&#150;04, which can be found in the board&#039;s annual report at: www.hmrc.gov.uk/pdfs/report2004.pdf.
