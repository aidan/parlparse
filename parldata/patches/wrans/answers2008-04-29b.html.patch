 <p><a name="stpa_709"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para5"><a name="08043010001722">In 2000 the Secretary of State issued guidance on matters to be taken into account by Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator, in agreeing companies' charges schemes, including charging non-household users that are not businesses. These include places of worship, community facilities, charities and voluntary bodies. The guidance stated that those making similar demands on a service should be charged on the same basis. It also made clear that where premises impose customer-related costs in line with or lower than those of typical households, they should be able to benefit from tariffs which reflect their small demand on the water system.</p>

However the replacement of rateable value charges for SWD with a site area based charge means that churches will be required to pay surface water drainage charges and will no longer benefit from the cross subsidy that resulted from the rateable value system.</p>

In RD35/03, ‘Surface water drainage—charging policy’ (September 2003), Ofwat concluded that charging according to site area was the best method of charging for SWD. Ofwat recommended that water companies consider introducing site area-based charging for SWD—particularly for non-household customers where the process is simpler to implement. However Ofwat also noted that, given that set up and administration costs of introducing this method were considerable, and would vary depending on customer base, it was for individual companies to decide if the benefits of implementing site area SWD charging outweighed the costs.</p>
