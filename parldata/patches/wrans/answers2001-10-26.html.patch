  There are 1,276 quality marked community legal service providers able to provide interpreting services for deaf clients through a British sign language interpreter or text phone services. Most providers, particularly those providing specialist help, are able to appoint an external expert such as a sign language interpreter. We are working to increase the numbers of providers who offer such services. The Legal Services Commission is working with the London learning and skills council to help support small and ethnic groups achieve the quality mark. A pilot is being run in two London boroughs and includes disability groups. All Community Legal Service Partnerships' needs assessments are identifying where there is a need for improved access to services for the deaf.
