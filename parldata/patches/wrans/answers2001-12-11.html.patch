  Pensioners who already receive the minimum income guarantee (MIG) will not have to make an application. They will automatically receive pension credit. For other pensioners who become eligible for pension credit as a result of the more generous rules, we are building on lessons learned from other recent initiatives. We will ensure our communications to pensioners are closely targeted and designed to help them to understand their entitlements.
