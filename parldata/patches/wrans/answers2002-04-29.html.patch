 <a name="20429w09.html_para2">We have publicised the results of the Financing for Development (FFD) conference on DFID's internet website. We intend to do the same for other major UN conferences. Hilary Benn the Under-Secretary has spoken to a meeting of NGOs about the results of FFD. We are submitting a memorandum on FFD to the International Development Select Committee. We will continue to press in a variety of international fora for progress towards implementing the commitments made at FFD, including on aid volume, aid effectiveness and strengthening the voice of developing countries in the international financial architecture. We intend to hold a meeting with interested NGOs and MPs after the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children to discuss its results.
