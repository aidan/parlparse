 The National Service Framework (NSF) for mental health draws attention to the evidence in the national psychiatric morbidity survey of high levels of physical ill health and higher rates of death amongst those with mental health problems compared to the rest of the population. This is confirmed in the more recent Office of National Statistics (ONS) survey of psychiatric morbidity among adults living in private households. Our policy as set out in the NSF is that assessment of people with severe mental illness should include assessment of physical health needs, and the care plan should identify the health and social care required to be provided under the care programme approach.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2002]: </i>The Green Paper, 14&#150;19: <i>extending opportunities, raising standards</i> sets out the proposal for an overarching award&#151;the Matriculation Diploma. A key aim for the Diploma is that it should provide a clear goal for all young people. It should motivate a greater proportion to remain in education and training until 19 and so contribute to social inclusion. Our proposal for an Intermediate Diploma should be within the reach of the majority of young people, and we suggest too that we should recognise the progress of those who make a sustained effort but do not reach the threshold for the Intermediate Diploma by awarding them with a record of progress setting out their achievements. Our proposals for guidance and support for young people during the 14&#150;19 phase should make an important contribution to the inclusion of those most at risk.
