  The Department and the other United Kingdom health Departments have commissioned Cancer Research UK to run SunSmart, which was launched in 2003, as the national skin cancer prevention and sun protection campaign. The SunSmart campaign includes raising both public and professional awareness of skin cancer through providing information about it and guidance on preventative measures to reduce the risks associated with skin cancer and exposure to sunlight. The campaign raises awareness through support for health promotion events, the provision of printed resources, media briefings and through the SunSmart website at http://cancerresearch uk.org/sunsmart/. SunSmart also supports schools in developing their own sun protection policies through school guidelines and curriculum resources.
