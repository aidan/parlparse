- In response to Recommendation Nine of the Strategy Unit Report &#039;Waste not, Want not&#039;, the Government are currently undertaking a review of recycling and composting targets in the light of performance against 2003&#150;04 targets. The review is considering the efficacy of the existing suite of targets, and the value in setting future targets. It will take into account the fact that there are already a number of policy levers designed to drive the management of waste up the hierarchy. The targets review will inform decisions by Ministers&#151;as soon as possible&#151;on any adjustment to existing targets and on any new sustainable waste targets to be set at national or local level aimed at driving up performance. Both reviews will take full account of stakeholders&#039; and the public&#039;s views.
