 <a name="11022w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
  Lord Ouseley's report was commissioned and prepared for Bradford Vision, a partnership involving local government, police and other agencies. The Public Order Community Cohesion Ministerial Group, which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary set up following the disturbances earlier this summer in the north-west, is looking at the wider issues of segregation, including education. My colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills are contributing to the group's work. The group will be taking full account of Lord Ouseley's observations on this issue in Bradford. I would not wish to anticipate the outcome of their findings at this stage.
