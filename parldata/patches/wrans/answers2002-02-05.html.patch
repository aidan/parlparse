  I am very pleased that the Chairman for Ceramic Training and Development has shown this level of interest in the development of sector skills councils. I understand that he has already met with an official from my Department to discuss options for the ceramics industry. It is, I believe, appropriate during the development of SSC's or during the negotiation of other arrangements, that contact remains between officials and potential SSC members. I have asked officials to continue the dialogue with the ceramics industry and look forward to receiving a report on the progress in due course.
