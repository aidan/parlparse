  I met with the South Korean Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and the Foreign and Trade Minister, who is Secretary General designate of the United Nations. These meetings covered bilateral, regional and international issues which, of course, included discussion of the relationship with North Korea. The hon. Member may also be aware that I had an opportunity to lay a wreath in honour of UK soldiers who died during the Korean war both at the War memorial of Korea, as well as at the site of a significant battle involving British soldiers in Gloster valley.</p>
