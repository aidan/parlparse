  The Government acknowledge the valuable contribution the report 'Making Contact Work' will make in addressing this difficult and sensitive area. The report makes a large number of recommendations, including some which would require legislative changes, on the facilitation and enforcement of contact between children and a parent who no longer lives with them. The Government are considering the proposals very carefully and will publish their response in due course. The Government remain committed to the principle that the welfare of the child must be paramount in any decision-making concerning a child's future, including decisions relating to contact.

  Trade Partners UK's public service agreement performance target is 'enhanced competitiveness of companies in the UK through overseas sales and investments'. It therefore supports overseas investment by companies in the UK where there is a benefit to the UK in doing so. Each case is considered on its own merits and Trade Partners UK has access to a range of information and advice through the DTI, FCO and other Departments, as appropriate, in doing so.
