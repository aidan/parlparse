  As part of the implementation of the NHS Cancer Plan we are developing a supportive care strategy. The strategy will ensure that people affected by cancer are able to access the right professional support, treatment and help, from when cancer is first suspected through to death and into bereavement. As part of the strategy, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been asked to develop and publish evidence-based guidance on supportive and palliative care. The initial NICE findings will be available from autumn 2002 and will include guidance on psychological and social support for patients and carers.
