  We have issued no guidance to local education authorities and schools on these matters. As schools' own records are not public records, it is for them to make their own decisions, consulting local public records offices as they think fit.

  Like any other borrowers, local authorities have a contractual obligation to comply with the terms of repayment specified in their agreement with the lender. The local government capital finance system requires English and Welsh authorities each year to set aside amounts out of their revenue resources to meet debt and other credit liabilities. This helps to ensure that, whenever a debt falls due, the authority has enough money to make the repayment. The Government have no immediate plans to change these arrangements.
