-<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The exchange with the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, was very useful, as were the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley. The Minister&#039;s clarification of what constitutes the voluntary and community sector&#151;or third sector&#151;was also useful, as was his clarification of percentage. In a sense, we are moving on from 40 per cent plus 16 <sup>2</sup> /subÿ, which is why it is so important to the voluntary and community sector to have some assurance that the way in which the Big Lottery Fund distributes money will be enshrined in law for the future. In many ways, that is why we on these Benches will not attempt to upset the Big Lottery Fund applecart. As the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, said, there was a great deal of consultation, and I have absolutely no doubt that there will be some very contented voluntary and community sector bodies if all the assurances that the Big Lottery Fund and the Government have given are met. We on these Benches try to reflect what some of the people who brief us and who have an interest in these matters are seeking to do. Otherwise, one would be going back to examining with much greater care precisely why we need this gargantuan body to take 50 per cent of National Lottery funds. So this assurance is of huge importance. That is why we would like it to be in the Bill.
