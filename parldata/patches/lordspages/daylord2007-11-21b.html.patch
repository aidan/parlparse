 <p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07112194000073"></a>My question to my noble friend is this. The BBC has been much in the spotlight since the committee's report was published is he satisfied that the new governance arrangements have stood up well to the challenges that they have faced? In carrying out its duty to represent the interests of licence fee payers, has the trust in fact been acting primarily as a regulator? If so, has that left the BBC itself&#151;and the director-general in particular&#151;without a robust champion?</p>
