 <a name="20722-32_para32"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the order will repeal Section 76 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Section 76 sets the standard for the admissibility of confession evidence in cases before the Diplock courts. In repealing Section 76, the standard set by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 will apply.
