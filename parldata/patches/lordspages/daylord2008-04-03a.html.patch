I said, &#147;You therefore know all the scallywags&#148;&#151;not that I am insinuating that anyone from Cambridge is a scallywag&#151;and he said, &#147;Yes, Minister, I was a scallywag&#148;.

The noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, was particularly helpful in this matter as Lord Chancellor, but not all others have been equally helpful. The result is that far too many Law Commission projects have remained on the shelf for far too long.

To some extent, it can be said that they have been a victim of their own success, because Parliament, for its part, has not found the time to implement the reports, or even in some cases, I fear, to consider them. This inevitably has been frustrating for the Law Commission, but more important still, it has been bad for law reform. What is now proposed is, to my mind, a great improvement. It will give Law Commission Bills a much higher profile, which is important. In due course, it may be possible to refine the procedure still further, but in the mean time, I hope that the trial period for which this scheme will run will prove to be a great success.</p>

As HIV became a managed illness, the threat to life reduced and those diagnosed with HIV could look forward to an expectancy of life. However, public awareness has not been maintained. Despite the production of the 2001 strategy and the introduction of other strategies and initiatives, people are unaware of the consequences of HIV.

Every noble Lord who spoke has approached the subject in a slightly different way and added something very important. I want to pick up one of the first things the noble Lord, Lord May, said&#151;that we need longitudinal work to draw attention to what happens with HIV. One of the lessons I always draw from our frequent debates on the subject is the need for persistence and repetition: persistence in looking at the issue and repetition in raising it. That is what we are doing today.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08040373000193"></a>The director of the Health Protection Agency, commenting on the statistics in November 2007, said that the sooner HIV and other sexually transmitted illnesses are diagnosed and treated, the less likely they are to be passed on. That is certainly true, as the noble Lord, Lord May, said, but it is important that the diagnosis is given in the right and sensitive way, together with correct HIV prevention information and coupled with ongoing support and monitoring. There is, as has been mentioned by several speakers, considerable stigma attached to the diagnosis of HIV and AIDS, especially in many ethnic minority groups, which produces a great fear of disclosure to friends, family and community. Patients often present late, already with advanced HIV disease, because of this fear.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08040377000013"></a>I had hoped that events in Zimbabwe would have moved on sufficiently yesterday for much of the Minister&#146;s Statement to be out of date, but I regret that this is not the case. The confusion that the Secretary of State spoke of yesterday has only partly been resolved. The Electoral Commission has finally announced most of the results for the 207 House of Assembly parliamentary seats, but there is still no official confirmation of the result of the presidential vote. Without this announcement, the situation grows even more dangerous. I am glad that the Secretary of State yesterday gave an assurance that the Government have been seriously considering contingency plans to ensure the safety of British citizens who could be caught up in any violence.</p>

There are an extraordinary number of distinguished Zimbabwean economists living in exile in countries such as Britain, Canada and the United States whom one hopes would be a lead part of such an effort. They can certainly be supplemented by expertise from organisations such as the Commonwealth. This is a time when help will be needed, not least because ending 100,000 per cert hyperinflation is a very difficult business. It involves a freeze on prices, which is immediately followed by empty shelves; Zimbabweans will feel that they have had quite enough of that. To manage this by using humanitarian interventions to prevent too much hardship for people as the economy is stabilised and the money supply brought down will be a challenge not just of economic management but of political will and of the stability of the new Government.</p>

I hope that it will be further discussed at the IMF spring meeting in Washington later this month. My question inevitably must be this. If somehow Mugabe manages to hang on, I do not believe any longer that we can leave the people of Zimbabwe on their own in light of the bravery that they have shown, so what plans will the Government make as a contingency&#151;a so-called plan B&#151;if the people are not given the outcome of the election that they have claimed?</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08040377000128"></a>I have one success to record and one serious current anxiety. The success concerns the attempted sale, 10 years ago, of a former military airbase, Bentwaters, within the AONB, not far from Woodbridge in Suffolk. During the Second World War the Royal Air Force built this airfield, intending it for use by fighter aircraft in defending us against attack by enemy bombers. It was not used for long and, with the arrival of the Cold War, was taken over by the American air force, the USAF, which had a second runway nearby, at what is now designated RAF Woodbridge. The Americans deployed a light jet bomber, the A-11, and its Cold War mission was to be available to attack Russian tanks should they start rolling across central Europe. That makes one realise how far we have moved on since then.</p>

It has adapted to changing circumstances, starting in the post-privatisation period, by encouraging cost efficiency and productivity, competition and consumer protection, as well as investment for future needs.</p>

They were totally unconcerned with any political views that I might have had at that time, which were pretty misty, but they provided me with very clear benefits. Trade union membership provides legal protection in times of difficulty and security of employment and tenure, for both of which I was immensely grateful. I exercised my trade union membership appropriately and in one case I was quite a leading member of those who called the further education lecturers out on strike when I was a further education lecturer in my very early days.

Leaving aside the wording of the amendment, I suggest for the benefit of advisers who are present that what is needed is something along these lines: at the end of subsection (4A) of the 1992 Act, one could say that the measure &#147;does not include membership or former membership of a political party where the values and ideals of the party are incompatible with a rule or objective of the union; the decision to exclude or expel was taken fairly and in accordance with the union&#146;s rules and written procedures; and the consequences of exclusion or expulsion would not result in exceptional hardship&#148;.

In other words, if they knew what was going on and decided not to say anything about it and not to pay the insurance contributions or have deductions made, that would be a sort of connivance, and they would not then be entitled to a remedy. There are very many cases when people simply do not know. If they are employed on that sort of basis, it may be that, when they want to sue for unfair dismissal because they feel that they have been unfairly dismissed, they do not have a case because they do not know the situation, whereas perhaps a worker who was born here and lived here does.

 <p><a name="08040374000082"></a>We believe that working individuals should be appropriately protected whether they are employees, workers or self-employed. Today&#146;s flexible labour market and changing working patterns mean that there is a wider variety of working arrangements than was the case in the past. There have been cases where it has been necessary for the courts to decide whether an individual is entitled to a particular right, and the body of employment law has been adapted and refined in the light of changing working arrangements. All that is a statement of the obvious, but it is perhaps important to put it on the record. The courts have developed a series of tests to determine an individual&#146;s employment status. In such cases, the courts have regard for all aspects of the employment relationship, including whether the contract is illegal.</p>

The Minister said that this would raise all sorts of difficulties in tax law, which would take a very long time to consider.

 <p><a name="08040374000101"></a>I have no pride of authorship in this amendment; it may not be the best way to define employment status or the status of an employee.

 <p><a name="08040374000105"></a>So the control test in proposed new paragraph (b) is the only test that really stands. The first is that the employer should be under an obligation to provide service personally, which of course is correct, and the last is that there must be an obligation on the employees to continue performing services and for the employer to continue remunerating the work&#151;which in modern jargon is generally called the wage-work bargain. Yes&#151;but, without something more, you cannot tell whether someone is in business on his own account. That comes under proposed new paragraph (b). It is slightly out of date, to put it mildly, given that 60 pages of cases are cited in the leading text book, showing that all sorts of other tests are used. The amendment would deal in particular not only with employment protection law but also with tax. I was told on the previous amendment that any amendment that touched no tax was much too difficult to consider until the next employment Bill, which may be way over the horizon. So I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, will see fit to withdraw this attempt to cover the entire area of employment law with a new definition, which, with the greatest respect, is deficient.</p>

The Government welcome the intention to clarify and simplify the existing provisions. The proposed changes in the legislation should maintain and improve road safety whilst minimising the burdens on industry and they should help to reduce distortion of competition through greater levelling of enforcement and compliance between the UK and other EU road haulage and coach operators. However, we have some reservations, particularly in relation to the proposed definition of cabotage, the responsibilities of transport managers and the information to be included in the interoperable national enforcement registers.

On average, M. bovis was detected in 15 per cent of badger carcasses ie around one in seven. This is similar to that recorded in proactively culled badgers in the RBCT during the same time period (16.6 per cent). An extended post-mortem examination carried out on a sample of 205 RBCT badgers revealed substantially more infected animals, approximately double, than did standard post-mortem examination. Therefore, these prevalence values are likely to be under-estimates.</p>
