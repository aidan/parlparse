The amendment followed NAPF concerns that the board would be required to undertake a complex and costly assessment of risk for small schemes which would be completely disproportionate to the amount collected. The amendment sought to enable the board to make exceptions to the rule requiring it to set a risk based levy for all schemes, and to set just a scheme based levy for small schemes with fewer than 100 members.

 I start by taking up some points made by Mr Malcolm Wicks in another place in replying to the debate on these issues. It is interesting that the arguments that he put forward are not the same as those that the noble Baroness made this evening on the same points about privilege, and so on. In response to my earlier intervention, she said that he was reading out his brief. It may simply be that he has difficulty in reading out his brief. In any event, it cannot have been <P>
