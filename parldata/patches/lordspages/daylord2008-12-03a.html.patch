I can now easily imagine being on trial for murder. We spent many happy hours selling the Millennium Dome and when he was then shuffled to the Home Office, he was replaced by my right honourable friend John Prescott. Some girls have all the luck. It was suggested to me that I had swapped the Lord High Executioner for the Ancient Mariner. I enjoyed chairing English Partnerships immensely and had the pleasure of working with many noble Lords across the House on important projects. As the new Homes and Communities Agency vests this week, I am proud of the legacy that English Partnerships left in the renewal of so many communities. If I might single out one achievement, it would be the remediation of the English coalfield, where in so many places now the number of jobs above ground far exceeds those employed in the pit even at the height of the industry. It is the most comprehensive regeneration programme ever undertaken in the United Kingdom and it was championed with great energy by my right honourable friend John Prescott.</p>

The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, made a typically elegant speech. He did so this time out of some pretty thin gruel, given the size of the gracious Speech. He spoke as a man free of the cares of office and clearly enjoying it. But you never know, this could have been the great comeback speech. After all, in this day and age, you can be cruising on a luxury yacht off a Greek island one day, only to discover that switch at No. 10 has got your number. The noble and learned Lord&#146;s support for the former Prime Minister, Mr Blair, will do him no harm either.

One of the internet biographies that I consulted listed her skills simply as &#147;management&#148;. She has certainly managed her task today with skill, humour and eloquence. Given her long-standing concern for the need for a vigorous and imaginative housing policy, I wonder that she does not share my surprise that the words &#147;housing&#148; and &#147;homelessness&#148; do not appear anywhere in the gracious Speech. Surely keeping people who are under threat of eviction in their homes and providing new supplies of social housing for those in need must be a priority in the coming year.

For those who, unaccountably, missed it, at one point, the presence in the Chamber of the members of the royal commission for prorogation is indicated by their full names being read out. So we had McNally, Tom for the one and Strathclyde, Thomas Galloway Dunlop du Roy de Blicquy Galbraith, for the other. Tom though he may be to each of us here, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has always seemed to me to be a touch under-endowed with names, while the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, seems to be very generously provided for.

 <p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08120346000116"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, has been a simply superb chairman of the committee. In this House, in the committee itself, and in dealing with the people and organisations in this country and across Europe with whom and with which the committee deals, he has been a model of how to chair a committee and a credit to this House. He has brought to the committee all the qualities that it was thought he would when he took over the chairmanship in 2002: his intelligence, his acuity, his strong sense of fairness and his extraordinary levels of patience&#151;no doubt sorely tried from time to time. Coupled with his background&#151;Eton, Cambridge, the Queen&#146;s Royal Rifles, television, the World Bank&#151;those qualities combine to make him a natural in this House and, of course, in the Select Committee. His knowledge, his experience and his authority have all been to the gain of the committee and of the whole House.</p>

If I can be allowed the smallest of partisan points from these Benches, it will be a genuine joy to welcome him back to these Benches as my noble friend. Our gain is the committee&#146;s loss but, more importantly, our gain is a gain for the whole House.</p>

His efficient conduct of his office has led to a reduction in the number of scrutiny overrides, from 64 in 2003 to 25 in 2007, something that all noble Lords will welcome.</p>

I understand that the noble Lord has represented this House on numerous occasions before other Parliaments and on international bodies, always with the skill, tact and diplomacy that has been associated with his name. It is for his international representation, as well as his skill as a chairman and his reputation as a good egg, that we on these Benches thank him for his work. As for his retirement, on another occasion over which the Lord Speaker presided, the noble Lord announced with some vigour that he had no intention of retiring and was just going to pause over Christmas before deciding what to do next. We look forward to finding out in the new year.</p>

During this year alone, it has scrutinised such diverse issues as working time directives, consumer credit agreements and the regulation of food information for consumers. It also carried out a major investigation into donor organ transplants which, as your Lordships know, is a matter of life or death for those awaiting organ transfer. The report that followed this extensive and intensive inquiry concluded that the EU directive would indeed help to improve the supply in Europe but emphasised the need to allow scope for clinical judgment and patient choice. I have no doubt that this report will, as do all committee reports, add immeasurably to subsequent legislation, to the benefit of us all.</p>
