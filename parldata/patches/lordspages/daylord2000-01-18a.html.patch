I have an interest in doing whatever I can to contribute to the reduction in the amount of stolen property which is never recovered. As we have already heard today, only around 25 per cent of stolen property in Kent is recovered, in spite of the attention of an extremely efficient police force under a Chief Constable of whose distinction we were reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate.

 <A NAME = "00118-22_para6"></a>I also have a specific interest in hoping that such antiques, cars or other desirables as I may possess remain in my possession and are not stolen. In the course of 23 years as the MP for a constituency already mentioned by my noble friend Lord Luke, my constituents, if they agreed with me in nothing else, passionately shared that concern.

He said that the proposal outlined in the amendment was not workable. I am not sure that he gave many reasons for that. It seems to me that there is every reason to think that a delegated structure would work. I see no reason why it should not.

 <A NAME = "00118-33_para6"></a>The Minister failed to put any flesh on the bones as far as concerns the proposed separate division. He did not make clear what form the division will take; what the division will amount to; what the structure will be; who will run it, and so on.
