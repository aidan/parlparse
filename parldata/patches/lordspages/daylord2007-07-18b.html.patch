 <p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="0707192000013"></a>The Commonwealth is unrivalled among international organisations because it can realistically aspire to be a Commonwealth of democracies. Time is running out. We have heard about the Commonwealth&#146;s economic advantage in the sense that it has within it the 13 fastest-growing economies along with the poorest 14. It can make a difference in these areas, as it can in development. I would like to suggest that we in the UK should take steps to make a realistic assessment of the potential and develop an agenda for meaningful engagement with the Commonwealth. To that end, I should like to know whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government would consider undertaking such an assessment through a process of wide consultation in preparation for the 60th anniversary in 2009.</p>

It is altogether good to see the Minister on the Front Bench. Previous Ministers have set a big challenge to meet with their powerful contributions. My noble friend brings with her great qualifications and very useful experience, not least&#151;if I may say so as a former director&#151;her effective role as a trustee of Oxfam.</p>
