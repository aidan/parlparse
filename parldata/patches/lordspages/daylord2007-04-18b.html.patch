The role of the Lord Chancellor in setting the size of the board or in consenting to the removal of the chairman of the OLC is non-interventionist. He will not change the size of the OLC of his own volition nor can he remove the chairman of the OLC. The OLC is a non-departmental body and as such is ultimately accountable to Parliament. It therefore must be right that the Lord Chancellor have the minimum of involvement in how the OLC is constituted. But when I say &#147;minimum&#148;, I mean exactly that. The Lord Chancellor has no role in approving any of the rules that the OLC makes in setting out how complaints can be handled, with only one exception: the rules on case-handling fees. He certainly has no role in appointing ombudsmen to determine complaints or in handling individual complaints. Therefore, any concern that he would have undue influence over the OLC is not substantiated. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am quite sure that the noble and learned Lord would not exercise his discretionary power in a prejudicial way. My concern is about the structure of the relationship between the board and the OLC. The OLC is subject to the board&#146;s jurisdiction. The right person to take decisions about the size of the OLC and its composition is surely the Legal Services Board, not the noble and learned Lord. That is the purpose of these amendments. I have listened very carefully to the Minister's reply; there is no meeting of minds on this matter therefore I wish to ask the opinion of the House.</p>
