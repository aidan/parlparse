But I fear that it may in practice achieve the very opposite of its claimed aims&#151;transparency, accountability, proportionality and consistency&#151;and instead produce confusion. It could also, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, and others have said, mean more bureaucracy and, as my noble Lord Hodgson said, cost. I can but hope that sensible amendments make it workable.</p>
