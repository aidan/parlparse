The Long Title had to be amended because the insertion of these new clauses in another place extended the scope of the Bill beyond the existing Title.

However, it is not concerned with officers in relation to this point; it is concerned only with directors. Therefore in the interests of clarity, and while this may be only a small change, for those consulting the Act in years to come it would be clearer if it referred to liabilities incurred by a company&#039;s directors because it does not affect the position of liabilities incurred by a company&#039;s officers. The Minister has told us that.
