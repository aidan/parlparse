 <p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09062549000172"></a>Fourthly, dementia is a disease. I was glad to hear a number of other noble Lords say that it is quite wrong<I><b></b></I>for<I><b></b></I>its treatment effectively to be classified as social rather than medical care and therefore means-tested. For dementia patients, that is all too often the practical consequence of the present system of charging for care. This fundamental point is most clearly spelt out by the Alzheimer's Society in its report <I>The Dementia Tax</I>. And what a value we have in the Alzheimer&#146;s Society&#151;without it, I do not think that we would not know half of what we know. I look forward most to the Minister&#146;s reply on this point. Is the treatment and care of dementia likely in future to be managed and financed on the same basis as any other disease tackled by the NHS? If not, why not?</p>

I pay particular tribute to the speeches by the noble Baronesses, Lady Murphy and Lady Perry, and my noble friend Lady Thomas of Walliswood. I should declare an interest as one of the 18 per cent of Members of your Lordships&#146; House who does not qualify for a bus pass. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, with every passing year, I become more inclined to think that I ought to carry a card that says, &#147;in case of an emergency, please note, she has never been any good at remembering people&#146;s names&#151;do not assume that she has got Alzheimer&#146;s.&#148;</p>

However, the Government said in their response that they had no intention of pursuing that idea. That is a big gap. There is a lack of parliamentary oversight of this area. It is falling in a gap between the Home Office and other departments, so a Joint Committee&#151;a considered suggestion from the Constitution Committee&#151;would be a very good first step. If we are going to have a cybersecurity operations centre, doing all the data mining and interception of web traffic that that involves, we surely need proper parliamentary scrutiny, starting with the Joint Committee. Finally, will the Minister tell me whether he still feels, in the light of the new cybersecurity operations centre, whether RIPA is fit for purpose? I hope that we have the opportunity to debate this at greater length, because there are an awful lot of questions that we need to ask about it.</p>

It was good to see her at the start of the debate. I have noticed that a colleague of hers has appeared on every media channel in the past two hours, talking about this national security strategy, and I must say I am impressed by the speed with which she had managed to read it and absorb it all. I apologise for the fact that there was an error in a department with a D Notice that went out quite normally. We try to protect people who have been working in very sensitive areas, but I am afraid that department put in a D Notice rather earlier than it should have done, and that led to a couple of articles. I wrote a letter to the Speaker and to the honourable Crispin Blunt in the other place, explaining that. I apologised for that having happened. The department that did it realised the error of its ways&#151;there are some people walking on stumps&#151;but I will not go into any more detail on that. The way we have issued this, with my right honourable friend the Prime Minister producing this as a Written Ministerial Statement, with two documents, was absolutely right.</p>

In relation to an NPS, the Secretary of State will specify a relevant period for parliamentary scrutiny. During that period, the Government will offer a debate on an NPS in the Grand Committee, for up to four hours. At the end of the debate, the Minister would respond. In order to facilitate debate, it is envisaged that a list of speakers would be opened for each NPS debate in the Grand Committee.</p>
