As I understand it, if contingency funding were introduced, the aim would be to amass between 1 and 2 per cent of deposits. In today&#146;s money that would amount to around &#163;15 billion, which is a not inconsiderable sum.</p>

I hope that noble Lords will not have mistaken my earlier amendments, which were designed to improve Clause 167, as approval of the clause. We on these Benches have grave misgivings about pre-funding the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. We agree with the British Bankers&#146; Association that the case has not been made for pre-funding. In the US, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation operates in a very different banking market, with many small regional banks for which failure is not an uncommon occurrence. Banking in the UK is very much more concentrated.</p>

These amendments add another subsection to proposed new Section 214B of the Financial Services and Markets Act, introduced by Clause 168. The clause allows the Treasury to make regulations for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and therefore the financial services industry, to contribute payments arising in connection with the exercise of the stabilisation powers under the special resolution regime. I am far from convinced that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme should be burdened with such payments, because it goes beyond the original intention for the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. It is justified by the Government on the basis that if the authorities did not act, a failing bank may well end up facing costs on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. If regulations are ever used, I predict that they will be a complete nightmare to operate.</p>

This concerns three new government clauses which provide for the specifics of the enabling power of the Government to make regulations to change the insolvency regime for investment banks. This power would only be exercised if the Treasury review concludes that a new procedure is needed. The first amendment in this debate introduces the second of four new clauses that will make up the enabling power. This new clause sets out the broad principles that would shape such a modified regime. The Government would be able to modify existing insolvency law in its application to investment banks or establish a new procedure for insolvent investment banks. In line with existing insolvency law, this new regime would apply when an investment bank is either unable or likely to be unable to pay its debts or where its winding-up would be fair.</p>

The Minister made some excuse about market conditions affecting legislation going through Parliament. We simply do not understand that. We have demonstrated on more than one occasion that it is perfectly possible to get emergency legislation through quickly but with proper scrutiny. The Minister should be in no doubt that this is one of the most important things that we have discussed because, as the Minister is aware, we regard the recommendations&#151;this is a very clear recommendation from the Delegated Powers Committee&#151;as having a special status in the House.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0901271000060"></a>I am disappointed that the Minister has shown no understanding that the clause is wrongly conceived. I do not know whether the right answer lies in my rather minimalist solution or in the rather more fundamental rewriting of the provisions in relation to the FSA and the Bank of England of the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. I am clear that some changes should be made to the Bill before we return it to the other place. We have a lot of thinking to do before Report, which will be upon us in no time at all. I see little point in asking the Minister to repeat ideas that we found incomprehensible, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The FSC is not a large body, but the matters which it considers are inevitably very important. The noble Lord, Lord Myners, who is no longer in his place, described this as being at the heart of the Bank. It is difficult to see how the matters included in subsection (2) of proposed new Section 2A would not be important. To that extent, I cannot see that it would be necessary for a sub-committee of the court further to divide itself.

Earlier we debated the issue of making public the minutes of the Financial Stability Committee. This amendment is on the same theme of transparency, but is about reporting publicly on how well the Financial Stability Committee is doing. Under the 1998 Act, there is a sub-committee of the non-executive directors of the Bank, which is given certain functions by Section 3 of the Act. Section 4 of the Act requires the annual report of the Bank to include a report on the matters for which the sub-committee is responsible. My amendment mirrors the arrangements for the non-executive sub-committee and requires a report within the Bank&#146;s own report on the matters for which the Financial Stability Committee is responsible. It does this by inserting a further reporting requirement into Section 4 of the Act.</p>

Before that supervision went to the FSA, the Bank had an overview of the financial and banking system as well as responsibility for supervising individual institutions. That meant that the organisation could utilise the information gathered in its broader role for its more specific role. In particular&#151;and this is the focus of my amendment&#151;the Bank had an overview of debt in both the economy and the banking system. Had it had concerns about levels of debt, or leverage in the banking system, those could have been fed back via the institution&#146;s specific activities.</p>

The credit-rating agencies came in for a lot of criticism for their involvement in the sub-prime debt crisis. Of course, the individual institutions that had their instruments rated did not escape blame, but the credit-rating agencies themselves attracted considerable blame. They also attracted blame from, for example, local authorities that had deposited money with Icelandic banks and felt let down by the ratings given.</p>

I think that I am right in saying that in a two-tier area the county council will have the duty to collect information and a requirement initially to provide that information, and that the district councils&#146; responsibility will basically be to provide to members of the public the information that has been collected and passed on to them by the county council.

Clause 10 is the first clause about petitions, which may detain us for an hour or two. There are a number of general points that I want to make about petitions to avoid having to make them all individually on every amendment, but I will wait until the next group, which is very substantive, to make them. Clause 10 is specifically about electronic petitions, so it seems sensible to talk about them at this point.</p>

In so far as it is designed to criticise the Government&#146;s efforts to create a prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach that tells every local authority up and down the country how to deal with each and every petition they receive, she would be right to describe it as such. However, I see the amendment as an effort to protect local authorities from that interference. It would render the rest of Clause 11 somewhat superfluous. The clause and, indeed, the rest of this part, is unnecessary as primary legislation.</p>
