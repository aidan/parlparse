 <p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09022735000063"></a>Talking about where opinions come from, we had to sit up and take notice when another place recommended an all-elected second Chamber&#151;we have moved a very long way from 1968 and the rejection of Dick Crossman&#146;s proposals for reform. What it says to me is that the other place must modify its commitment to the dominance of the other place over this Chamber, as an all-elected upper House would plainly have legitimacy to develop the use of its powers.</p>
