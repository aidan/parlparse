 <FONT SIZE=3>transactions that are caught under the European Union merger legislation carry only a civil offence, not a criminal offence. Bigger cartelisation would therefore not be punished with the criminal penalties that smaller cartelisation will be. We regard that as a significant issue that needs to be explored with the Government.

-<a name="20702-04_para101"></a>We will want to explore one or two other details relating to the mechanics of competition policy reform. For example, we believe that the investigation of offences should be assigned to the Serious Fraud Office rather than to the Office of Fair Trading. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, may disagree. I look forward to hearing his views on that issue. We suspect that the SFO is better equipped for that sort of work than the OFT. We wish to explore that with the Government in Committee. We have reservations about surveillance powers which, in a clicheÿ, can be described as a snoopers' charter. We wish to explore concerns on that matter.

 <a name="20702-04_para102"></a>We would welcome comments from the Minister when he winds up about the Government's proposals as regards what the noble Baroness described as the "Desmond issue". I understand that in the papers which are the subject for consultation on the communications Bill, the Government have indicated that they propose to put something into the Enterprise Bill to deal with the public interest element on newspaper mergers. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that. It is particularly unfortunate that this particular clause will always be named after Mr Desmond. There have been other occasions when newspaper mergers have had a public interest element, but I suspect that we shall spend the next month referring to it as the "Desmond Clause" and when the Minister explains how he proposes to deal with this issue.

 <a name="20702-04_para128"></a>To my mind, the Office of Fair Trading needs to be bold and proactive in competition matters. But, after all, it is only supposed to conduct preliminary investigations. To require it to demonstrate more than "reasonable suspicion" before it refers the question to the Competition Commission would be unduly inhibiting. It would be a "Catch 22" situation to require it to know the answer before it puts the question.
