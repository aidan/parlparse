 <a name="21128w02_para4"></a>The Government have welcomed the publication of this report. They recognise that there is still more to be done to ensure that the highest standards of child protection are applied in every case. That is why they commissioned the joint chief inspectors' report. It is also why the Secretary of State for Health and the Home Secretary set up the statutory inquiry, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, into the circumstances leading up to, and surrounding, the death of Victoria Climbie. The recommendations of the joint chief inspectors' report and those of the Victoria Climbie inquiry will provide the Government with an authoritative basis for any reforms to child protection that may need to be made, and if reform is necessary the Government will implement it.
