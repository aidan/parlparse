 <p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The whole question of water supply is key to all of us. We cannot live without a steady water supply. I have tried to refer to the effect that it has on us as individual consumers and householders, on those who grow our crops and our land, and on future food security supply. I have also tried to reflect on our new and ever increasing responsibility to the environment and wildlife. I am sorry that my noble friend was not able to be here to move this Motion, but it gives me great pleasure so to do. I beg to move for Papers.
