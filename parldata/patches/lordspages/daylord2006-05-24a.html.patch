-<a name="60524w02_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  The noble Lord&#039;s Question tabled on 28 March [HL4991] was answered on 17 May 2006. The reason for the delay in answering was because the issue of confidentiality clauses in loan agreements to political parties was one which was still under consideration by the Government, in the context of new provisions relating to the regulation of such loans which were subsequently tabled to the Electoral Administration Bill on 26 April.
