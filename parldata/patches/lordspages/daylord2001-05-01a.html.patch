 <A NAME = "10501-23_para5"></a>We believe that Amendment No. 86 is, I am afraid, impracticable and unworkable. I hear what the noble Lord said about the question of the historical record. Companies' existing records are kept at Companies House in a variety of formats, including microfiche and paper.

Under new Section 723C(4) regulations may be made restricting the persons to whom, and the purposes for which, the relevant information may be disclosed. The relevant information is defined as information relating to the usual residential address of an individual who enjoys the benefit of a confidentiality order that has been obtained in prescribed circumstances.
