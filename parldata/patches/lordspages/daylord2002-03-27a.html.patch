 <a name="20327-05_para6"></a>Normally, this kind of Motion would be very much a formality, but I think that noble Lords would wish me to take the opportunity to offer the thanks of the House to the noble Lord, Lord Alexander, for his excellent chairmanship of this important committee. He took it over from the late lamented Lord Rippon of Hexham. There is no doubt that he has helped the committee to grow in stature. It is now one of the most important committees of this House.
