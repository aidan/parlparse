 <a name="20514w02_para1"></a>However, we have been encouraging local authorities to consider using existing possibilities to restrict the resale of right to buy properties to local people. Under the legislation local authority landlords selling properties located in national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty or rural areas designated for this purpose have discretion to impose restrictions on their resale. An owner may be required to offer the property back to the landlord (if they wish to resell within 10 years) or to people who have lived or worked locally for three years. We want to make sure that more of the existing housing in rural areas is available to local people. There are currently 24 designated rural areas and our November 2000 Rural White Paper Our Countryside: The Future encouraged other local authorities to consider seeking designation.
