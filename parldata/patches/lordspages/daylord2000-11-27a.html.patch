 <UL>Further to the Written Answer by Baroness Scotland of Asthal on 8 November (WA 152) about the recent visit by the United Kingdom Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to the Cayman Islands, what notice the Governor received of the visit; whether he took any of the relevant period as leave; and, if so, why he took leave at that time.

-<A NAME="01127w04_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotand of Asthal: </B>   The dates for the CPA visit were set after the Governor's arrangements to visit the UK for a number of duty calls and annual leave had been made. It was not possible for these to be rearranged, as the Governor was not able to leave the Cayman Islands until after my own visit and had to return in time to dissolve the Legislative Assembly and preside over electoral arrangements. The Governor informed the Cayman Island's UK Representative when the CPA visit was first proposed of his absence from the territory during August and early September. The CPA visit was organised by the Cayman Branch of the CPA, not the Governor's office, in the knowledge that the Governor would not be present. At the time of the visit the Governor was carrying out official duties in London.
