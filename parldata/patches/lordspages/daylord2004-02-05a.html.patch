-When I asked the Library some time ago to find as much information as it could on the panel's objectives, composition, method of appointing, current personnel and the mechanics of how it now works, I ran into difficulty. The Library did its best, but because the panel is non-statutory, it was unable to come up with much detail. When I reviewed the Library's information at the weekend, I found it curious that we are to airlift that body suddenly into statute without knowing what it looks or feels like and without having a schedule that sets out its objectives, raison d'e¤tre, the confines within which it works and how its membership shall be comprised. We have been careful to do that in setting up other organisations and yet not here.
