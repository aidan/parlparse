 <a name="20701-07_para27"></a>Kananaskis was the first G8 gathering since 11th September. Naturally, we welcome the practical steps agreed to fight international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. We also welcome the full re-emergence of Russia on the world stage. It is right that the G8 should help to reduce her nuclear stockpiles and fitting that Russia will assume the presidency of the G8 in 2006.

 <A NAME="20701-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, while it is right that corruption in all its forms should be denounced, and without seeking to defend dictators in Africa, does my noble and learned friend accept that fault in relation to Africa lies not entirely within Africa? Does he recall the years of the Cold War when the dictatorship in Zaire was fully supported by Western governments because it sat on the right side as far as Communism was concerned? Does he also recall that decades of strife in Angola were artificially fostered by the United States arming the UNITA rebels of Savimbi? Perhaps we may take comfort from the fact that the problems in Africa are now being given serious consideration? I welcome the support promised to Angola so that it can stabilise a long-lasting peace.

-<a name="20701-07_para63"></a>In terms of support for Africa I believe that we have moved a long way. Some of the rather mean comments about the summit have to be set aside the words of President Mbeki of South Africa who says that this is the end of an eÿpoque of colonialism and neo-colonialism. Although it may be a long time before that journey is completed, at least we are making an honest start.

 <a name="20701-10_para14"></a>They then proceeded with the selection of a chief constable and what happened was absolute chaos. First, people involved in the appointment leaked the events to the press, in particular the Irish Times in Dublin. Secondly, the appointment was seen to be biased. Thirdly, one of the candidates threatened to take a case for religious discrimination. I have to say that my experience of independent members of the new Northern Ireland Policing Board is not very good. On Saturday morning, one so-called "independent" member actually took part in a BBC Radio Ulster programme on behalf of the SDLP. So much for his independence.

 <a name="20701-19_para4"></a>I shall indulge in a small personal anecdote. Last year, I sold a house on a common adjacent to the Malvern Hills. The common was owned by the Malvern Hills Conservators, and there was a frontage of about six metres between my garage and the road. When I came to sell, I discovered that, because of the legislation, a payment was required. When I bought the house, my surveyor, my lawyer and everyone else who advised me were unaware that compensation would have to be paid. Certainly, they did not alert me to that possibility. It never occurred to me that I was doing anything illegal by taking my car out of my garage and putting it on the road. It was necessary to reach an agreement, in great haste, with the conservators on a payment, so that I could go ahead with the sale of the property.
