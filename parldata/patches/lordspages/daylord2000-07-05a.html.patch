 <A NAME = "00705-18_para4"></a>The drafting of such conditions will inevitably give rise to legitimate differences in interpretation between the authority and the licence holder. For example, some licence conditions require the licensee to use "best endeavours", while others require the licensee to "make sufficient arrangements" or to "take reasonable steps".

-<A NAME="00705-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   My Lords, I recognise that Amendment No. 55 addresses a real issue. This amendment is aimed at allowing a renewables order to be put in place before the introduction of separate licensing of supply and distribution. It reflects a concern that there may be an interval between the introduction of separate licensing of supply and distribution and a renewables order. As the clause is currently drafted, we cannot make a new obligation until the separation has taken place. To that extent the noble Baroness and I are in agreement. This is because the clauses are drafted so as to place the obligations on the new category of electricity suppliers as they will exist only after the separation. But I want to reassure the noble Baroness that this will not be a problem in practice.

 <A NAME = "00705-21_para8"></a>We aim to introduce a new renewables order as soon as we can, consistent with the timetable we are establishing for full and proper consultation on the detail of the order. Equally, we will waste no time in bringing in the separate licensing of supply and distribution. That is why the Government tabled Amendments Nos. 113 and 114 for consideration today which will allow this to happen before the transfer schemes under paragraph 2 of Schedule 7, which will split the public electricity suppliers into separate supply and distribution companies, have been approved by the Secretary of State.
