We also went on to say-this was raised earlier this afternoon by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in one of his many interventions-that we welcomed the decision of some companies in the audio-visual industries to change their business models in order to meet the legitimate demands of their customers while generating returns on their investment in content. Those two things went side by side; I reiterate that today. The music industry, for example, has taken those words to heart.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="100126100000042"></a>Clause 17 explicitly does not create new criminal offences, but some would say that the gaps in the criminal law are far greater than those in the civil law. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, referred to this earlier; I hope that the Minister has managed to give him some reassurance that the Fraud Act will cover camcorder use in cinemas, but there are other areas, and certainly some of the issues raised by the recent failed prosecution in the OiNK case beg questions about the criminal law. However, they will not be covered by Clause 17. Again, many would say that dealing with some of the criminal law aspects is a great deal more urgent than trying to deal with some speculative aspect of the civil law. The Government need to explain in what way Clauses 4 to 16 will be ineffective outside peer-to-peer infringement and they need to suggest a different process, probably as a way of amending the 2003 Act.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="100126100000044"></a>The sub-committee of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recognises the changes, as the Minister made clear, but goes on to make the point that primary legislation is more suitable for these kinds of changes. The super-affirmative procedure is not an adequate substitute for Parliament's established way of dealing with matters of complexity and importance-through primary legislation. With Clause 17 we could be placing draconian new duties on ISPs and preventing access to certain websites. "Tackling online infringement", to use the wording of the clause, is not a narrow purpose when in the future probably most of us will derive our entertainment over the internet.</p>

 <p><a name="100126100000103"></a>Government Amendment 211A provides that the Secretary of State can act only if he is satisfied that the infringement in question is having a serious adverse effect and that making the amendment is a proportionate response. There would, of course, have to be evidence to validate and support that. It was further suggested that Clause 17 would allow the definition of "copyright" to be amended. I make it clear that this is not a power to make sweeping changes to the nature of copyright or to what constitutes copyright infringement. The limitation not to amend any criminal offence means that no change can be made to what constitutes infringement, but the measure could be used to help us to protect creators of all types from having their work unfairly exploited without their permission. This power will be used only where new technologies or new services are being used in such a way as to cause serious adverse effects to the rights of others which cannot be tackled under the existing legislation or by the mechanisms in Clauses 4 to 16. The power cannot be used to change what is and is not considered an infringement under copyright law. Therefore, consumers need not worry; behaviour which is considered reasonable and lawful now will not be restricted in the future.</p>
