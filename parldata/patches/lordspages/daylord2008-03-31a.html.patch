We have the best pharmaceuticals, aerospace and electronics industries and are now manufacturing twice as many cars as we were 25 years ago. Therefore, if I may say so, rumours of the death of manufacturing are somewhat premature.</p>

Why has there been such a delay and can the position of cross-border aid, which is needed by those people in order to survive, be addressed urgently?</p>

As noble Lords know, Black Rod was a creation of King Edward III, and for more than 650 years successive holders of the office have served their sovereign, this House and, indeed, the Order of the Garter with unfailing loyalty. Sometimes this has brought them up against the political arm, and on occasions those were the most powerful in the land. They have even had to arrest Members of your Lordships&#146; House from time to time, but that is not something that has been held against successive Black Rods by this House.</p>

It did not need President Sarkozy to tell us last week, although he did so both admirably and eloquently. Britishness is here in the bones of our Parliament, in our ways and in our traditions, and Black Rod is very firmly part of it. Many noble Lords feel that keenly. Lately we have too often carelessly scorned our traditions; I refer in particular to the dumping of great offices of state such as that of Lord Chancellor. It is high time to stop tearing up our roots and start nurturing them, so I am sure that I speak for the vast majority of this House when I say that we want no change to the nature of the office of Black Rod. But that is not what is proposed in this House Committee report; it is the nature of our House that has changed. The demands made by newer Members in particular for new office space&#151;</p>

That should be up to the Convenor and the Chief Whips of the respective party groups. Wee are talking about the management of projects for the provision of new accommodation. A massive project is being undertaken in the multi-million pound development proposed for Millbank. This issue, and that of Black Rod, were not passed on the nod but discussed and deliberated at length in the House Committee. I believe it was right for the Clerk of the Parliaments to recommend and for the House Committee to agree that this specialist task of managing the huge building works to meet our accommodation requirements requires special skills and full-time attention. And with so much attention being given to the expenditure involved, it is essential that this House shows in this project that it can use public money prudently.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0803317000138"></a>I understand the necessity of having an important person to take charge of the Parliamentary Estate in the House of Lords and that he should be called a Director of Facilities, but I do not see why he cannot be responsible to Black Rod. Black Rod has always looked after these affairs as well as the security, the attendants and the doorkeepers. I do not see why it is not possible to have a person who is a highly-paid official and an expert who is responsible to Black Rod, so that there is continuity. I would have thought that was a reasonable thing to do. It worries me that we are proposing to employ this new gentleman at &#163;100,000 a year&#151;a great deal of money and a good deal more than Black Rod gets&#151;who will do only half the work that Black Rod does. He will get twice the emoluments but apparently do half the work. That is in rather a vulgar sphere, but at least it is pertinent.</p>

I felt that the noble Lord seemed to misunderstand in one respect&#151;I thought that he referred to the Director of Facilities being in authority over Black Rod; that is not the case. Both people will be responsible to the Clerk of the Parliaments; both will be members of the Management Board. The jobs will be separate. The noble Lord also asked me when the Palace was consulted. All that I can say is that it was consulted some time ago; I do not want to go into the details, but it was certainly not today or yesterday. It was before that. The noble Lord also raised the issue of the possibility of constructive dismissal; but, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, no one is actually being dismissed in any case, because the present Black Rod has been given an extension to his contract until May of next year, and these changes will apply to the person who takes over as Black Rod at that time.</p>

In relation to the targets, it brings together in one place at the beginning of the Bill the things that the Secretary of State has a duty to do from the original Clause 1 and the things that the Secretary of State must do under new Clauses 13 and 14. That will make the Bill&#146;s purpose much clearer and the way it operates more logical.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0803317000212"></a>Secondly, the Minister argued on Report that the amendment would weaken the Bill. It could be said that the Government draft is stronger because it relates the duty directly to the final objective set for 2050, but in my view this is illusory. The link with the 2050 target is an indirect one, depending not only on what the Secretary of State does, but also on how society responds. As a result many legal experts, some of them in this House, have cast doubt on whether the Secretary of State could successfully be challenged in law. The amendment is superior, in the view of many, because it relates the duty to those things a Secretary of State actually does&#151;developing policies and implementing them&#151;and not to something that a Secretary of State does not actually do, which is emit CO2. The test then becomes one of whether the actions or omissions of the Secretary of State are reasonable in relation to the objective. That looks to me like a proposition that a court could handle.</p>

It was identified last year by the Joint Committee on which many of your Lordships served, and while the introduction by the Government of what are now Clauses 13 and 14 go some way to rectifying the fault, in my view they do not go far enough. Therefore I hope very much that the Government will complete the process by agreeing to adopt this amendment and refining it if necessary during the Bill&#146;s passage through the Commons.</p>

Its global universality is one of the virtues of the Commonwealth and, after he had left, some of us smiled as a series of Ministers from what I will call the smaller island territories said that the situation was so threatening and so imminent for them that they had already carried through such legislation as was required, and at least 10 had full-scale plans at a much higher state of advancement than anything we can claim.

It is as though nothing else is in the Bill. We have just heard that no legal requirement is placed on the Secretary of State other than the 2050 target but that is not true. The 2020 target is a legal duty; it is set out in Clause 5. All I ask is that noble Lords look at the facts of the Bill as it stands, rather than what it might have been or some of the early rhetoric of our debates. There is even a duty to publish a compliance action plan if one of the five-yearly budgets is missed. The idea that we have legislated for 2050 and ignored everything else is just not true. It is there in the Bill. If we are getting such inaccuracies the fourth time we debate the Bill following Second Reading, all I can say is that I am at a disadvantage.</p>

They are going to be delivered by the main economic movers; namely, private companies acting to meet those targets within the framework that the legislation and the Government set. For those companies to change the way in which they behave in relation to carbon and carbon equivalents, they need to ensure that they have proper, verifiable measures of what the carbon and carbon equivalent is and that they are built into their central motivation for their management, their staff and their researchers so that the success of the company relates to a large degree to the way in which it minimises its carbon and carbon equivalent emissions. For that to happen, we need a proper system of accounting, supported by guidance and the accounting profession to ensure not simply that carbon is effectively traded on a verifiable and equitable basis but also to change the way in which companies behave, research is rewarded and managers receive promotion to highlight the company&#146;s image and its public relations. Without that dramatic behavioural change in private enterprise, we will not achieve the targets set in the Bill.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08033124000019"></a>On Virgin Radio this morning, there was an advert from the Carbon Trust saying something like, &#147;If you&#146;re a business, we&#146;d like to help you to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide you produce&#148;. Perhaps that is the wrong way around. Business should have a moral obligation to do so if we are to push this forward. We risk producing a piece of legislation that does nothing more than be a piece of legislation, because there are other pieces of legislation. Local government has an obligation to try to reduce domestic carbon dioxide emissions by 30 per cent but no means by which to do so.</p>

I am using my experience from this place and from the other place. I have to say that the postcards can be a real bore, especially when they come in separate letters from Members of Parliament and require individual replies, to which they are entitled. It is a brave Minister who spends large sums which have not been agreed with colleagues, but that is not an issue with these amendments. As I and others have already said, when the Bill goes to the other place, the Government&#146;s collective view and individual views will determine how the Bill finally ends up and the lines that are taken. There are no lines in the sand in that respect. Every amendment that this place sends to the other place will be considered and either rejected or modified, as happens when the Government think again. Therefore, taking this completely sensible and cost-effective approach, I am going to suggest that the House accept the amendment.</p>

I am absolutely consistent in my support of the railways. I have received in the past few weeks&#151;they passed through his hands&#151;some terrible, evasive answers which have not given information, given misleading information or given information that does not answer the question. We want satisfaction on this issue.

The key choice is the type of regulation, not a choice between having the Secretary of State or the ORR acting as the regulator. The case is not clear cut, and the course that we have chosen to follow is the one that we think will deliver the greatest possible return. In our opinion, any arguments against it are not sufficiently compelling to merit changing the existing regulatory arrangements.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08033136000026"></a>I thank the noble Lord for tabling this amendment and allowing me another opportunity to outline the Government&#146;s position. Under the present legislation, the Secretary of State can support services in the United Kingdom. In the context of international passenger services, that has translated into supporting Eurostar UK Ltd, the part of the Eurostar joint venture that is responsible for paying the UK-side access charges. The Secretary of State has not stood behind the French and Belgian parts of the joint venture in that way; they rely on the French and Belgian state railways for any support they receive.</p>

As I have said before, the Government&#146;s intention is substantially to reduce the public support for international services, mainly by putting in place a commercially sustainable, long-term access charging regime. In Committee, noble Lords were concerned that the Government&#146;s position had changed since Second Reading. I assure them that this is not the case; our position on providing funding to Eurostar has remained unaltered since the Bill was introduced in another place.</p>

In the environmental field, this fee could be as high as &#163;3,000. Some offences of this kind might in future be dealt with by means of a civil sanction. However, the noble and learned Lord&#146;s amendment would preclude the use of a fixed monetary penalty altogether, as the Minister would be unable to prescribe a fixed monetary penalty at a level that reflected the benefit that a business might accrue in not obtaining a permit.</p>

In our view, when a regulator decides to impose a penalty, the defendant should have an opportunity to make representations as an innocent party. The penalty should not already have been imposed.</p>

I understand that, for reasons of expediency, it would be ridiculous for him to press it any further today, but it should be recorded that there are persons present in the Chamber who think that it is misguided to have this transference of what I might call criminal justice powers. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, will say that it is all civil, but it is on the edge between criminal and civil law, and, if we get the chance, I shall argue that we should not go down that road at all. I very much support the notion that there should be a discussion to see whether there is any other way of proceeding other than the way in which the Government currently wish to proceed.</p>

The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, and the noble Lord, Lord Neill, obviously feel strongly about this. They ought to tell us at Third Reading what representations they made to Professor Macrory on this important issue and what representations they made on the extensive pre-legislative scrutiny. Their views have been expressed widely, and I would be interested to hear that before Third Reading. Bearing in mind the importance with which they treat this issue, it behoves them to let us know exactly what happened.</p>

I cannot understand why, if anyone wished to implement what they tell us is Hampton and what they believe to be Macrory, they did not choose to do so on a much more limited scale to find out how well it worked.</p>

Furthermore, while we may agree with the sentiment behind Amendments Nos. 59 and, as it happens, 66, it may stop the use of other, more transparent, means of providing evidence to persons subject to a sanction. For example, instead of providing all the relevant material in the notice of intent itself, as suggested by the amendment, the regulator could instead provide full access to its investigation files. Some regulators, such as the OFT in competition law investigations that are comparable to the civil sanctioning regime, use this means of providing all the relevant material to persons subject to regulatory sanctions. In certain cases this could be a more efficient means of providing information to benefit both the parties rather than the more onerous requirement to state all of the facts and matters in the notice of intent itself. I am sure that, on this basis, the noble and learned Lord would not wish to have these unintended consequences given that the requirement already exists in law.</p>

Courts can perfectly well understand these things, but they stand back, are independent, and look at them in the context of ordinary life in this country. Now it is being taken to a group of specialists and to a system where you are found guilty and you incur the penalty. You can even run up costs for not paying the penalty on time because it continues to run, it seems, unless and until an appeal tribunal suspends it temporarily, which it may or may not do, and you may or not understand.</p>

I am amazed that no principle seems to exist for determining which cases will go to the courts, which will be administrative penalties, which will be&#151;massively&#151;variable penalties, which will be fixed penalties, or how much the fixed penalties will be. The Government have just not answered those questions. I hope they will reflect further.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08033147000107"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, asked about the need at all for variable monetary penalties and why they are there to capture benefits of non-compliance, particularly if the more serious offences are to be prosecuted through the criminal courts instead. They would be useful in instances of non-compliance where a business has inadvertently breached regulations and corrected its breach quickly but has made a significant financial gain or competitive advantage. I mentioned the case of Citigroup, where a fine significantly captured the competitive advantage that it had gained from non-compliance. In that circumstance, a regulator might decide that a variable monetary penalty would be a more appropriate and proportionate response than a criminal prosecution.</p>

The tribunal will also have the power to overturn or reduce the level of the penalty imposed by the regulator or to take any other steps that the regulator could have taken in relation to the incidence of regulatory non-compliance.

Is not the whole structure here based on the fact that the regulator imposes the penalty? The penalty stands unless and until the defendant&#151;the alleged wrongdoer&#151;appeals but, as we shall discover a little later, the defendant has to pay up and also to prove his innocence before the appeal tribunal. Therefore, the position is the same as if the regulator imposes the penalty. I also ask the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, to reflect on this very carefully.

 <p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="08033147000242"></a>In the event of a national regulator working in partnership with local authorities, such as on food safety, we would expect the regulator to prepare the guidance in consultation with the LBRO and local authorities, and then for the local authorities to publish the guidance. Where there is no national regulator, the LBRO would prepare the guidance, working with the relevant government department and the local authorities. The local authorities, as regulators, would then publish the guidance. This approach should help reduce the workload for local authorities and ensure the consistency which we agree with the noble Baroness is critical. We have set out on pages 44 and 45 of the guide to the Bill exactly how the approach will operate, so that local authorities will not be left exposed. I hope that, in light of what I have said and of the fact that the head of LACORS is now satisfied, the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_474"></a><a name="0804011000031"></a>There are other safeguards, some of which the noble Lord alluded to. The Minister has the power to suspend a regulator&#146;s sanctioning powers in the event of persistent misuse of the sanctions. There will also be other checks and balances. For example, if a regulator&#146;s decisions are consistently overturned on appeal, we would expect the Senior President of Tribunals to bring such matters to the Government&#146;s attention as part of his duty to make an annual report under Section 43 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. Regulators are already obliged to have regard to the better regulation principles contained in the compliance code. Regulators are already subject to regular Hampton implementation reviews. As noble Lords may know, the first five such reviews were published on 20 March. Ministers also have the right to monitor a regulator&#146;s performance as part of existing governance arrangements. These mechanisms will be effective in discovering problems in the culture and performance of regulators. I hope that in the light of the comprehensive set of checks that already exist on regulators the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That would remove a key tool for securing the removal of regulatory burdens for a significant proportion of the economy and would frustrate the implementation of the House of Lords Select Committee&#146;s clear recommendation. We previously assured noble Lords that we did not intend for the duty to be applied to the competition functions of the regulators in a way that would give scope to undermine or second guess their decisions. In fact, we have gone rather further. To address the concerns of my noble friend Lord Borrie, we have excluded any functions that are carried out under competition law. Other than the regulators detailed in Amendment No. 102, the duty will not be applied to any other regulators, including local authorities, via the Bill. The duty will be applied only where and when appropriate by order, and the orders will be agreed by Parliament. I beg to move.</p>

As she will be aware, we tabled amendments that would effectively have deleted Part 4. We did so for two reasons: first, for the reason of the substance which has been very much dealt with by the noble Baroness; and, secondly, we were concerned by the procedure that had been followed regarding Part 4. It is not often that I get confused between substance and procedure, but in this case it is a particular pity that the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, is no longer in his place, because he rather admonished me on why he had not got involved in the pre-legislative scrutiny. It is important, and I have congratulated the Minister&#146;s department over the years on the way in which it has developed pre-legislative scrutiny and consultation on quite important Bills. The problem with Part 4 is that, although there was extensive consultation and scrutiny regarding the Macrory proposals and the Bill, Part 4 was very much tacked on at the end without any appropriate consultation.</p>

E-MERLIN is the development of a network of seven UK radio telescopes run by the Jodrell Bank Observatory and funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) in partnership with the North West Development Agency and the University of Manchester. The STFC has recently undertaken a review of all its existing programmes to make sure that they are delivering, or will deliver, the anticipated science output, and that they continue to represent value for money. The initial results of this review have been subject to consultation with the relevant scientific communities, and the STFC is currently considering the responses it has received. The STFC has yet to take a decision on its future level of support for e-MERLIN. However, the STFC has made it clear that the e-MERLIN project is part of its strategy for radio astronomy and that it is in discussion with its partners about the issues raised by the review.</p>
