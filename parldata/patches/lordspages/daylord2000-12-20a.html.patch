 <UL>Why in a Written Answer on 22 May (WA 61) Lord Bassam of Brighton stated that damage to a total value of &#163;500 had been caused in a search of HM Prison Blantyre House on 5 and 6 May, when the Prison Service's internal report on the raid asserts that damage to the value of &#163;6,100 at full commercial rates had been caused and when in guidance to the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee the Director General of the Prison Service stated that repairing the damage from their own materials costs the service about &#163;2,500.
