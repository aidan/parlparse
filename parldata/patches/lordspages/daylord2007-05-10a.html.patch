 <p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07051076000317"></a>I reflected this morning that the words &#147;social care&#148; have passed into our professional and political language fairly recently. Many of us grew up using words like &#147;care in the community&#148;, &#147;care outsideof hospital&#148;, &#147;care when you go home&#148; and very possibly &#147;family care&#148; to cover all the areas we shall be addressing today.</p>
