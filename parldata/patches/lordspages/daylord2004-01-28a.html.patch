-<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40128w02_spmin3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  (a)</B>  The average marginal rate on both individual and employers contributions is estimated to have been around 30 per cent in 2002&#150;03. If there were no changes in contributions or behaviour this would be a tax neutral single rate compared with the current system. (b) Assuming the current rate of contributions and again no change in behaviour a 1 per cent reduction in a single rate of relief would reduce the current annual cost of tax relief by around half a billion pounds. (c) Around 2.5 million higher rate taxpayers would see the relief on their contributions reduced compared with now, which would also include a new tax charge on those with employer contributions, and around 13 million non-higher rate taxpayers would see their rate of relief on their contributions increased.

 <a name="40128w02_para4"></a>However, introducing a single rate of relief would not necessarily result in increased pension savings. There could be significant behavioural changes by individual pension contributors, employers and pension schemes. This is particularly likely for defined benefit schemes where the current net pay arrangements deliver relief at the individual's marginal rate of income tax and where employer contributions are typically made to satisfy the overall funding of the scheme rather than being attributable to particular individuals. Given the uncertain direction of these behavioural effects on contributions, it is unlikely that the figures given above would be realised.
