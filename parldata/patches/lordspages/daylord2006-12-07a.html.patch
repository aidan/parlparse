 <ul><a name="06120776000118"></a>&#147;Still they stand, the churches of England, their towers grey above billowing globes of elm trees, the red cross of St George flying over their battlements, the duplex envelope system employed for collections, school mistress at the organ, tortoise stove slowly consuming its ration, as the familiar seventeenth century phrases come echoing down arcades of ancient stone&#148;.</ul><a name="06120776000113"></a>John Betjeman wrote those words in the introduction to the <I>Collins Guide to the Parish Churches of England and Wales</I> in 1958. In the half-century since then, the elms have gone, and the cross of St George has become more readily associated with the new national religion of football. My right reverend informant tells me that the duplex system has fallen into desuetude. The flat prose of the late 20th century has replaced 17th-century cadences. While the churches of England mainly still stand, between 1970 and 2004 the Church of England closed some 1,630, and 85 listed churches were actually demolished. The churches that continue to stand defy financial gravity.
 <p><a name="06120776000005"></a>In a predominantly secular age, when innovation is our public watchword, why should it matter to us that our heritage of historic places of worship of all faiths should be conserved? It is a question of respect; another of our watchwords. As Simon Jenkins, the latter-day laureate of churches, wrote in <I>England&#146;s Thousand Best Churches</I>:</p>
 <ul><a name="06120776000119"></a>&#147;Into these churches Englishmen and women have for centuries poured their faith, joy, sorrow, labour and love ... The church marked each event in life&#146;s calendar ... It was a patron of community ceremonial [and] a gallery of vernacular art&#148;.</ul><a name="06120776000114"></a>The physical manifestation of the church, more often a cumulative creation than a single expression of architecture and design, with its carving in wood and stone, wall paintings and altarpieces, stained glass, brass and iron work, tiles, embroidery, books, language, its music and bells, its whole ritual and life for centuries has met profound human needs, which we no longer know very well how to meet in communal life. These places remain however, for unbelievers too, landmarks and centres and symbols of communal identity. In 2003, 86 per cent of the population visited a church. Some 24 per cent of city dwellers said that they went into a church to find a place in which to be quiet.
