 <p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08040251000033"></a>I should like to ask my noble friend for help in two ways. First, he mentioned the supermarkets. Will he join the campaign to get better prices for UK pig producers and ensure that it is passed down and does not get stuck in the supply chain to the farmers? Secondly, with the highest animal welfare standards in the world, will the Minister do something about the unfair competition from importers who have nothing near our animal welfare standards?</p>

Some other countries in Europe&#151;Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany&#151;certainly have high standards.

We believe that our amendments are compatible with our international obligations under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The amendments will, I hope, remove any argument about a hierarchy within the purposes of sentencing. Essentially, the court will have to have equal regard to the principal aim of the youth justice system, the welfare of the young person and the purposes of sentencing. I believe that the amendments clarify the position. I hope that they will reassure noble Lords that we do not believe that the welfare of the child should be a subordinate consideration.

 <p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08040251000113"></a>I prefer Amendment No. 47 to the earlier amendment as it shifts the balance towards responding to the many problems encountered by young people in our society which derive, one way or another, from a lack of love in childhood. That is the root of the problem, and the chaos in family life these days in our society feeds that. We see that from the news this morning about Shannon in Yorkshire and the family circumstances from which she has come. Also, the prevalence of child pornography in the news this morning illustrates the underlying culture that we face. As a bishop, I visit youth offending institutions and it is often chilling to see the way in which they operate. Young people are regularly sworn at&#151;I could give more details. We need a change of culture in our approach to youth justice. I am grateful to the Minister for the move that he has indicated in his introduction to this government amendment, but I believe that Amendment No. 47 points us in a better direction.</p>

Security is put first, which is why security seems to run everything. In fact, if we are talking about preventing reoffending, helping people to live useful and law-abiding lives should come first, with the qualification that they must not be allowed to escape and must be treated with humanity. My noble friend Lady Stern and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, made the point that what is missing from that aim is that it should be in the interests of the child. Saying that the aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending, which it is not, is missing that the aim of the system is to help young people to live useful and law-abiding lives and to rehabilitate them using methods that are appropriate to them as children. I hoped that, after listening to us, the general spirit of making children count would have been reflected in revised aims and principles for the youth justice system that would be put in the Bill.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08040255000020"></a>I had the unhappy experience of being twice burgled by an 18 year-old who had once been the friend of one of my sons and therefore knew the layout of our house. She was ordered to pay &#163;450 compensation by magistrates, at &#163;10 a week. She paid twice, I think; I got &#163;20. Eventually the probation officer got in touch with me and asked if I would mind if the magistrates set that order aside. I said I could not understand why they had made it in the first place. Although I understand that this would give all the powers to the court for under-18s, I wonder whether anyone has ever come across someone who had the money to pay compensation.</p>

It is very worrying that we still do not have a government reaction and that there has been further delay because wider research is apparently needed before the Government can come to any conclusion. Smaller units, relevant to the local community, are being recommended, as my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham emphasised, which seems to fit the pattern of what the Corston report argued for women offenders and which would clearly fit this pattern. It is also noticeable that not just the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights was making those points and the international Centre of Crime and Justice Studies, but also the Local Government Association. It is terrifying that 40 per cent of the boys, but 67 per cent of the girls have serious mental health problems. What are we doing about it? We have heard it all and it has been extremely saddening.

 <p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08040251000241"></a>The second flaw is the extremely high hurdle required by this amendment to send someone dangerous in some respect to prison. Not only do they have to have committed an offence, but the possibility of them committing another one must be imminent. If, for some reason, they go abroad and are not in a position to commit another offence in this country for six months, there is no imminent risk of an offence; they are not likely to commit an offence immediately. So it must be demonstrable and imminent. I do not know quite how you can demonstrate that they are likely to offend immediately, in a few days or weeks. Perhaps the noble Baroness will be kind enough to clarify exactly what that means.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08040264000012"></a>In replying on the last amendment, my noble friend said that those of us advocating it were on the side of humanitarian concern. We are proud to be so, but it really is not just about humanitarian concern&#151;that is part of the exasperation that arises. It is about being effective in protecting society, because what is being done at the moment does not protect society. That is the point. What is the tough way to protect society and what is not? Here there is a complete coincidence between what makes enlightened humanitarian concern and what is effective at achieving results.</p>

I will write to noble Lords on the figures, because I know that they are of great interest. Overall, my understanding is that the number of under-18s in custody has remained relatively stable over the past seven years. The proportion of under-18s given custody as a proportion of all under-18 disposals has actually fallen from about 4 per cent to 3 per cent. It is an indication&#151;I do not say any more than that&#151;that there has been a greater use of out-of-court disposals. We seek to increase the availability of out-of-court disposals in the future, and the Bill contains such provisions.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08040264000045"></a>In our view, the inference is illusory. When one is dealing with a suspended prison sentence, as your Lordships know, one is dealing with an offence that has passed the custody threshold. This follows from guidance issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, as I indicated in Committee. At page 24 of the guidance, the Sentencing Guidelines Council sets out the questions that the court should ask itself. First, has the custody threshold been passed? Secondly, if so, is it unavoidable that a custodial sentence be imposed? Thirdly, if so, can that sentence be suspended? Thus, if a court concludes that a custodial sentence should be imposed and if the option of a suspended sentence is removed, as the Government so intend, prison is inevitable. Removing the power of magistrates to use suspended sentences for summary offences would have the opposite effect to that intended by the Government: it would increase the prison population, not reduce it.

The results of that, ultimately, would be that around 400 people&#151;I want to be very careful with figures here because there is no way of proving the point as I am referring to the future rather than the past&#151;would end up in prison who would not be there if we remove the suspended sentence for summary-only offences.

It is not serving a proper purpose because it catches offenders who ought not to be caught; it is catching criminals who are guilty of quite minor offences of violence and yet are being made subject to indefinite sentences of imprisonment.

 <p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08040268000027"></a>We are clearing up yet another example of a knee-jerk introduction in the 2003 Act which was not subject to proper regulatory impact assessment. Although the introduction was right, the impact on the Prison Service has been disastrous, with vast numbers of people awaiting courses in order to be released. The impact has been disastrous, too, on the Parole Board, and it is only going to get worse. Therefore, while I entirely support the principle, it seems to me that what needs to be done is for us to look at what the impact of the proposed increase to four or seven years is assessed to be, but also at the impact on the Prison Service and Parole Board to see whether they can deliver what needs to be delivered to make the thing work. The whole system becomes discredited if it cannot do what it imposes in its Bills.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08040268000029"></a>It is obvious that there is a relationship between the initial sentence threshold and the risk. When a court is considering the risk, it should ask what the best evidence is. The best evidence is the offence with which it is dealing: it is what the man has done. Therefore, for all those reasons, the amendment should receive the wholehearted support of the House.</p>

The problem is, of course, how to get more people cycling. In urban areas the answer is to make it safer and speedier. I congratulate Sustrans, the CTC and some local authorities on their work to provide safer routes to school, to work, to the railway and bus stations and to the shops. However, the lanes have to be properly designated. They need to be more than just white lines painted on the road. Even little bits of rubber nailed into the road surface so that drivers know that they have strayed into the cycle lane when they feel a bump, as exist in Paris, would be a great help.</p>

When he replies to what further debate there will be&#151;I do not suppose that there will be further debate&#151;I hope that he will explain why, in the Government&#146;s view, two years will be enough to solve the problem. Perhaps he will give some indication of why he takes that view. I beg to move.</p>

We think that a four-year sentence is about right. It would be unusual to receive a four-year sentence for a trivial offence. We are attempting to strike a balance between ruling out cases that are simply not serious enough to be considered in this light and allowing the courts, as I said, to detain very worrying offenders, even if their immediate offence is not so serious as to deserve an extremely weighty sentence. I know that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, went on to describe the potential problems that he saw with persons sentenced under those provisions given the pressures on the Prison Service. I understand that, but the Government have taken, and are taking, steps, as I described earlier, to increase the resources and the priority that are given to the programmes that need to be established to enable these prisoners to satisfy the requirements of the Parole Board. That is in addition to the more general expansion in prison places in line with the Carter recommendations.</p>

There are shortages of essential humanitarian supplies such as medicines, foodstuffs and hearing aids. Restrictions on supplies of fuel and electricity have led to widespread power cuts and water shortages. While we fully understand Israel&#146;s security concerns, we do not support the decision to close Gaza crossings. The Foreign Secretary and I have called on Israel to open them, and to lift all restrictions immediately on humanitarian supplies and electricity. While resolving the humanitarian situation is in the hands of the parties concerned, we are doing what we can to help alleviate the situation.</p>
