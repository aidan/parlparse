 <p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09061632000117"></a>I apologise also for being somewhat telegraphic in my speaking to the amendments. I have given notice of my questions, as I have said, and I am not sure, given the Statement which is to follow, that the House would want me to spell things out in greater detail than I intend.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09061632000119"></a>The Public Bill Office accepted the amendments with no demur, even though they are to the schedule, which was agreed, albeit reluctantly, by the House at the previous stage. The amendments deal mostly with questions asked by my noble friend Lord Tope, to which the noble Lord then dealing with the matter was unable to give any answers. Although I have used the &#147;leave out&#148; device, these are probing amendments, albeit at a late stage, in order to gain a greater understanding of a number of particular matters within the new schedule.</p>
