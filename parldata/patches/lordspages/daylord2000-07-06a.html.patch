 <A NAME = "00706-09_para0"></a>Turning now to Amendment No. 56, Clause 35 lays a duty on the CAA to compile and maintain a register which is to be available for public scrutiny of matters relating to licences and exemptions. It includes provision for the CAA to exclude matters relating to a person which might seriously and prejudicially affect that person's interests. It makes provision for the Secretary of State to direct the CAA to exclude anything which would be against the public interest or any person's commercial interest.
