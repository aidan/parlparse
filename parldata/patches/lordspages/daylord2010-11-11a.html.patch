Attached papers (for example, statistical tables) should be deposited in the Libraries of the House. If reference is made to documents in a response, copies of these documents must also be placed in the Library.</p>

Furthermore, departments should be helpful to MPs and Peers, particularly where the fact or figure requested is contained in a much larger set of information.</p>
