 <a name="30108w04_para4"></a>The tangible assets included &#163;59,773 million as the net book value of the trunk road network. In general terms, roads that are "open for traffic" are valued on the basis of their estimated depreciated replacement cost. Roads (or parts of roads such as additional lanes) that are still under construction are valued on the basis of the capital expenditure incurred to date on their construction. The last full revaluation of the trunk road network was carried out by professional surveyors, as at 31 March 2000. This valuation was carried out mainly using internal unit costing and physical asset records provided by the Highways Agency. Certain large structures, for example the QEII Bridge, and roadside communications were valued at historic cost, appropriately indexed. For other large structures, insurance valuations were used as the best approximation to the replacement cost. The valuations were indexed to 31 March 2001 to reflect changes in the Road Construction Tender Price Index.
