 <p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07012484000002"></a>First, it is difficult to see how the United Kingdom can exert any leadership and influence on the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty&#151;if that is what we and the rest of the world want and, essentially, need&#151;if we insist on a successor to Trident that would preserve our own nuclear-power status well into the second half of this century. On the other hand, abandonment, even perhaps before Trident finally wasted out, could be seen as a bold and striking decision intended to show that the country is resolved to return to the position of moral and ethical standards for which it was once widely recognised&#151;and seems largely to have forgotten recently&#151;and to exert some real leadership in the modern world, as the right reverend Prelate mentioned. Some major international player must take a lead in this. While making a further 20 per cent reduction in superfluous warheads may be seen as a gesture in the right direction, it hardly compares with abandoning Trident in favour of properly funding our Armed Forces with what they need to meet the commitments laid upon them, so that they can act, in that much vaunted phrase, as a force for good.</p>
