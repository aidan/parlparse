I do not think that the debate was planned to take place in the very week when the world is plunged into the vital need of public health across the globe due to swine flu. It may be better referred to as Mexican flu, named after the country of origin, as were Spanish flu and Hong Kong flu. This is a complicated virus, containing pig, fowl and human viruses. The fight to control a flu pandemic will involve many professional bodies, and the public should be kept informed with the correct information and guidance to take the necessary precautions.</p>

Does the manufacture of the quantities of vaccine needed not require thousands and thousands of eggs? Do we have enough eggs? Does Tamiflu have a sell-by date?

He has consulted widely with subject experts, learned societies, teachers and other professionals, and his review is informed by excellent practice in our best schools and internationally. Throughout the review he has kept in the forefront of his thinking the interests of children and their parents. I am confident that his work will make a huge difference to millions of young people, helping to ensure that their primary years equip them with the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to thrive in their future education and later lives.</p>
