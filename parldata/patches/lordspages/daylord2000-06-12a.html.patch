As to foxes being vermin, we seek to control them in different ways. Fox hunting is undertaken by some for pleasure and by some for fun. I draw no conclusion although it is not something that I particularly see as fun. The report clearly and fairly states that banning fox hunting would not make much difference to the size of the fox population. We would undoubtedly apply instead means that are commonly in use.

 <a name="00612-18_para4"></a>I understand that we are limited within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. But perhaps further thought could be given to the definition of the conduct; that is, where the interception actually takes place. If one could not phrase it in terms of intercepting a transmission domestically, I would urge the Minister to look at that issue quite seriously.
