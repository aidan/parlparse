 <p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="09070981000085"></a>I agree with the STRB&#146;s recommendation about data collection and analysis. That is why my department is developing the new school workforce census which will provide comprehensive data on an annual basis about the individual characteristics, contract details and pay of school teachers. The development is being piloted with a view to full live rollout in 2010. The data collected from schools and local authorities in England will include age, gender, ethnicity, disability and qualifications&#151;all at individual teacher level&#151;to allow detailed analysis related to diversity and equality issues.
