 <p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="06120431000003"></a>There is nothing sweet about diabetes. My words tonight will not be honeyed as we address the global pandemic and desperate need for the United Nations to unite to defeat diabetes. Every 10 seconds someone dies from diabetes. Some 6 per cent of the world&#146;s population suffers from diabetes, and these numbers rise relentlessly each year by a further 6 per cent. If nothing is done to repel the silent killer, within 20 years 350 million diabetics worldwide will place an intolerable burden on all nations&#146; health systems with dire consequences for their economic and social well-being and development.</p>
