 <A NAME="20318w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Blears) has discussed patient transport services in London with Age Concern. This was following the publication of Age Concern's report A helicopter would be nice: transport to health services for older Londoners (a copy of which is in the Library). The outcome of the discussions is that the national guidance, on patient transport services, produced in 1991 is being reviewed. The Department of Health is involved in cross-government work which is examining the nature of transport barriers to accessing work, learning, healthcare and other key activities and services and, where appropriate, policies will be developed to remove those barriers.
