I believe if people had more information&#151;about how they could spend their money on their house and so on&#151;they would be in a position to invest and this would help our economy. In the United States, as a delegation which I lead found, this approach is very strong. A lot of information is provided through museums and big DIY centres, to encourage people as to how they should invest in their house and property. There, there is a particular problem with hurricanes, but also climate change. I have spoken to my noble friend Lord Hunt&#151;one of many &#147;Lord Hunt&#148;s&#151;about introducing this decision for the UK. There are ways in which the smart approach could well be adopted and I commend the gracious Speech to this House.</p>
