The advice that I personally had for my husband was from the specialist diabetes nurse, who was the link with the hospital unit and the community. She would visit our home and check the records. When the blood sugar went too low or too high, she would advise on the insulin, and she was a link with the consultant. For our carers to have such support was invaluable.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07050169000050"></a>Perhaps the best and most hopeful answer thatthe Minister could give to the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, is that, withinthe dreaded phrase &#147;modernising nursing&#148;, his department will provide comparative studies of different models of deployment of specialist nurses. They could be of different models in acute trusts, primary care trusts and GP practices jointly employing nurses, or they could be population studies. We know that the populations of peoplewith different conditions vary dramatically. Some neurological conditions affect only a small number of people in a given area. What is the best specialist nursing arrangement for such conditions? The value of the specialist nursing role is not in doubt, as evidenced by tonight&#146;s debate, but the question of the value of different patterns of commissioning and deployment has yet to be answered. That is the information that the department could most usefully provide.</p>

Most of what I was going to say has already been said, so I shall not repeat it. However, I shall draw the attention of the House to Thomas Guy, who was a governor of a famous London teaching hospital 300 years ago. He became dissatisfied with the way that the chronic sick were being looked after. He made a fortune printing bibles in Holland, and he used his money to build a hospital called Guy&#146;s Hospital for Incurables. Unfortunately, he died before the hospital was opened, and it soon put aside the business of the chronic sick and got on
