Where reasonably practicable, this asbestos is being removed in a controlled manner. However, much of the asbestos is located deep within the fabric of the Palace and is extremely difficult to remove. This asbestos has therefore been left in place and is monitored to ensure that it is not disturbed. This is in full compliance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.</p>

If it is a good thing to leave asbestos alone, why, a week before the break, did two men tell me that they were going to take up the carpet in the Earl Marshal&#146;s Room to see whether there was any asbestos? Surely if you take up a carpet that has been tacked down, you are disturbing the asbestos underneath it. Perhaps it is one way to get rid of the noble Lords.</p>
