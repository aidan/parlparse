If the accused is willing to settle, there is no need for a determination of his civil rights and obligations. The informal procedure which the authority wants to bring in, that already exists in the SROs, can therefore continue, but not the other set of circumstances which we believe is incompatible with the convention. I hope that the Minister, on due and mature reflection, will come to the same conclusion.
