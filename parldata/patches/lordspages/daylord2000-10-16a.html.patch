This may lead to a hiatus: the lottery may have to stop and then start up again, with all that that implies--losses incurred by good causes and retailers all around the country? Can the noble Lord tell the House whether that is not now a real possibility unless the entire lottery commission resigns?

Certainly, we need to ensure that the National Health Service is as flexible as possible. There are particular challenges when it comes to GP practices where there may be a small number of principals and where such an incident can cause problems. The development of personal medical services is providing much more flexibility in the way in which GPs are employed--for example, through the use of salaried GPs and other methods.
