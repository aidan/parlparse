-<a name="50113-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conway </b>  : I am very grateful to the Minister for her justification of this clause. Nevertheless, I am far from convinced of the necessity for this particular panel. I turn to the three functions which the noble Baroness described, the first of which is the advice on the inspector&#039;s remit. I would have thought it is very much a matter for the education committee of the Assembly. There is a statutory education committee and it is a matter for that committee and the Minister as to what the inspectorate&#039;s remit should be. Similarly, as regards the inspectorate&#039;s annual plan, that is surely a matter for the Minister to approve. It is not a matter on which to seek advice from a body of practitioners.
