 <A NAME = "00419-05_para31"></a>I know that my noble friend the Minister recognises that the current crisis in community care--for which disabled people and their carers all over the country blame the Gloucestershire judgment and the now almost equally notorious Powys judgment--is placing an increasingly daunting strain on the NHS. It is a crisis that demands urgent action. Not to act now to reverse the immense damage of these judgments would be to dishonour those in all parties who worked long and hard and with deep commitment and sincerity to achieve the enactment 30 years ago of a measure that a senior French legislator was soon afterwards to describe as a moment critique for disabled people everywhere.
