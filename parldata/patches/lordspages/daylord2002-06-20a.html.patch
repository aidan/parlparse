Investment totalling &#163;600 million in England and Wales is committed up to 2005, aimed at achieving further improvements, targeted at over 100 sewage treatment works and several hundred storm overflows. Ultra-violet disinfection of effluent has been or will be provided at over 120 sewage treatment works where this is needed to protect bathing waters, bringing water quality benefits to some 180 bathing waters.
