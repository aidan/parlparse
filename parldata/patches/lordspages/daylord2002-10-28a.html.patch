 <a name="21028-17_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I apologise to the Minister for returning to this matter. On Report he will have heard me say that I would not return to it; but on reading Hansard I noted that the Minister drew my attention to the Lewis case. As soon as I reflected on the point, I realised that there had been some misunderstanding between the noble Lord and myself about the basis upon which the amendment was tabled on Report. Therefore, I return to it now.
