I well remember in 1994 pleading with the then Minister of State, Allan Stewart, "Do not take Helensburgh and put it into Argyll and Bute". The people of Helensburgh had a difference with their representatives at the time, the Labour councillors, and rightly so, but they had a short-term interest in doing that. I represented the Helensburgh seat. Now, less than 10 years later, the Helensburgh people are saying, "It was wrong for us to go into Argyll and Bute". The lesson is that if you carry out exercises in this House with politicians and do not include the Boundary Commission and the local element, you will get artificial constructs. That is the history of Argyll and Bute.</p>
