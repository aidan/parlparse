 <p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I am going to say something positive, which I hope will happen. Several things need to take place, but we must all agree that the objective of a power-sharing assembly is the right way forward and it has my support, full and unequivocal. IRA/Sinn Fein, which has 25 per cent of the vote, requires representation. But before that representation is granted, several things need to happen: there must be a verifiable, open and complete decommissioning of all arms; there must be a statement that the war is over; and all punishment beatings and all forms of criminality must cease. Of course the loyalist paramilitaries must do likewise and in the same way.
