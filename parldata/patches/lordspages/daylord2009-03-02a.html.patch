 <p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09030230000033"></a>There are also issues around responsibility, whether fiduciary or otherwise. What happens if there is an accident on a volunteering project or expectations for a proposal are not met in qualitative terms? These matters require consideration, but more important is that they require consultation. At this point I am not satisfied that the proposition as a principle is worthy of support and consideration because it has not been sufficiently thought through in the detail of its application. I would certainly want to seek to persuade the Minister to look again not just at the principle but at the detail and some of the inherent problems for which solutions to the satisfaction of your Lordships&#146; House have not yet been found.</p>

The concept of taking part in social activities as an aid to integration is clearly a good one, but there is such a fog of uncertainty surrounding it at present that we need time to think it through and see if it can be done. Will we be able to include trades union activities, party-political work and so on? We need to be able to get the right exemptions for the disabled, for example, or for those caring for disabled people. I agree strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Patten, about the problems facing voluntary organisations, so I urge the Government to postpone the whole idea at least until after the simplification Bill that we have been promised. If that could be done, I think that we will get much better results from it.</p>

 <p><a name="wa_stpa_27"></a><a name="09030220000041"></a>The amendments to the common position voted by the European Parliament on 17 December are the latest step in a complex negotiation; a process of conciliation between both parties, the presidency and the Commission is now under way. Officials from my department are in contact with a range of fire and rescue service stakeholders to ensure that the potential impact is understood; and working with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which has the UK lead on the working time directive, to inform the ongoing debate and ensure MEPs and EU member states are briefed appropriately.</p>
