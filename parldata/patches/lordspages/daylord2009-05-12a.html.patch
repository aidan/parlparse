As I have said, I do not believe that there is disagreement between us on the principles. We believe that the powers in the Bill are broad enough in appropriate cases to protect marine conservation zones from all damaging human activities. I can assure the House that the Bill allows for this. We have heard mentioned a number of times the marine nature reserves at Lundy and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, suggested, they are highly protected by anyone&#146;s standards. However, I cannot see how the Bill as it is currently drafted would in any way cause a reduction in those standards of protection.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09051261000078"></a>Clause 113(1) states that the appropriate authority&#151;for England, this is the Secretary of State&#151;may designate marine conservation zones. It applies no restrictions on the power of the appropriate authority to set stringent restrictions. Clause 120(2)(c) refers to the requirement to report to Parliament and talks specifically of areas where licensable or extractive activities are prohibited. Licensing conditions can be set under Clause 68(3). They can be as stringent as necessary and they will come under the duty of public authorities in Clause 121 to best further or least hinder the conservation objectives of each marine conservation zone.</p>
