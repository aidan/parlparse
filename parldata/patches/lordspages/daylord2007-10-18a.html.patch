 <p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07101815000122"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when we debated the first Government alcohol harm reduction strategy in May 2004, I said that it had little hope of making a real impact on England&#146;s most dangerous habit, and I am sorry to say that that forecast has been disastrously confirmed. Alcohol harm has steadily increased over the years and is continuing to increase. It is no wonder that Ministers refuse to update the estimate of September 2003, which put the amount of the damage at &#163;20 billion a year. From the figures that I have studied, I believe that &#163;22 billion would be a more accurate figure now&#151;an increase of 10 per cent since the Government published their preliminary strategy in 2003.</p>
