Under subsection (3), a supplemental property transfer is one that provides for property being transferred from the transferor under the initial instrument and makes any other provision that an original property instrument could make. That is set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (3).</p>

Orders as envisaged by Clause 47 are needed only because there is the possibility of partial transfers. Paragraph 1.14 of the special resolution regime is relevant to assessing whether you can make a general order. It says that the property transfer powers provide the authorities with the flexibility to split a bank. This option would most likely be used for the purposes of transferring the good part of a failing bank&#146;s business into a new company, either as private sector purchaser or a bridge bank. In either case a residual bank, a &#147;resco&#148;, would be left behind, containing any untransferred assets and liabilities.</p>

As I have said, legal uncertainty during what might be only a transitional period could be as damaging as legal uncertainty in the whole area. With those comments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We have spent the past hour or so talking about these transfers and it is clear that important issues arise out of them in connection with set-off, netting and other similar transactions. Even if agreement is reached and harmony breaks out between the Treasury and the banks over the next few weeks over what the terms of the statutory instrument should be, we ought not to be in any doubt that this is difficult territory where people may not have worked out what is exactly the right answer. For example, the British Bankers&#146; Association is concerned that practical problems and unintended consequences may emerge which need to be dealt with. That is not to challenge the bona fides of the Treasury in conducting and responding to its consultation, but to state a fact of life about this hugely complicated area. The amendment therefore proposes an annual assessment which, although it may appear to be onerous, addresses such an important area that goes to the heart of whether or not transactions work for regulatory capital purposes, possibly actually destroying the market in the UK, that it needs to be set against the damage that could be done to our banking industry.</p>

These provisions would ensure suitable compensation for those who have netting or set-off contracts associated with a bank that is then the subject of a special resolution regime&#151;compensating them for any losses that they may suffer as a result of the implementation of the special resolution regime. The idea is that, instead of dealing with the difficult issue of clean legal opinion, we say, &#147;Okay, we might not be able to proceed in that direction, but we can provide a compensation regime that will provide comfort and cover some of the uncertainty with which we are struggling and that unfortunately we seem to have introduced while pursuing the laudable objective of developing the special resolution regime&#148;. These two provisions deal with the problem through the compensation route. I beg to move.</p>

I had expected that the term &#147;independent valuer&#148; would be defined in some way in the Bill but could find nothing. Independence is of course a term of art, not science. It varies according to the context. It therefore may be difficult to define on an ex ante basis, but ought not to be difficult to define when coming to an individual order. What do the Government have in mind? Will it always be the case that the valuer is independent of the tripartite authorities; that is, the Bank of England, the Treasury and the FSA? Does the valuer have to be independent of any person who could benefit from a compensation order? In the case of widely held securities, how is that to be interpreted if the valuer is, say, a partnership or a company? Will the interests of the valuer&#146;s partners or fellow directors, their spouses or other family members, be taken into account?</p>

In the proposed system, there will be an appointing person, an independent valuer, his staff and monitors, and overall, and at every stage subject to the drafting of the secondary legislation, the Treasury. It all sounds very expensive. Are there precedents for monitors of remuneration and/or compensation schemes, and, if so, in what circumstances? Has the requisite work been done to estimate the cost of all this? For example, judging from a previous debate, a tender might be put out in the search for a valuer and, if so, his remuneration will be set out in a contract. What would the monitor&#146;s responsibilities be and who would the monitor be? I suppose that it could be a Treasury official but I guess from previous debates that that is not the intention. Perhaps the monitors are to be chosen, following another tendering procedure, from the private sector. Can we have a fuller explanation of the need for monitors? I beg to move.</p>

Amendments 101 and 103 replace the words &#147;subserviate it to&#148; with &#147;subordinate it to the&#148; on the two occasions that they appear in Clause 58. My question is: is &#147;subserviate&#148; a word? My spellchecker does not think so and the word appears in virtually no dictionaries, although we found it in the <I>Oxford </I><I>English D</I><I>ictionary</I>, which cites only two known uses of the word. We may conclude that it just about qualifies as part of the English language. On the other hand, it is most definitely not a word used by lawyers apart, presumably, from the parliamentary draftsmen on this Bill. From our research the word has never been used before in an English statute.</p>

I was about to move the next amendment, which might have confused the Minister. Amendment 104 seeks to change &#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148; in Clause 60(1), which deals with third party compensation arrangements in cases of partial transfers. This clause allows the Treasury to make an order which will give effect to the &#147;no creditor worse off&#148; safeguard promised by the November consultation document. The industry has welcomed this and we support it, though as I mentioned in connection with the set-off and netting issue, the lack of certainty about outcome of the processes set out in the draft order&#151;and, indeed, in the clause&#151;means that it adds nothing to the legal certainty that is required for set-off and netting arrangements.</p>

The first group of amendments removes the duty on local councils to promote understanding of their functions and democratic arrangements and those of connected bodies. Instead it replaces that duty with a responsibility to note the desirability of doing so. That may seem like a trivial drafting point, but I believe that it sums up what is wrong with the Bill and how the Government&#146;s approach differs from ours.</p>

If Clause 1 is to be in the Bill, there is a striking omission: the role and duties of a local authority councillor. It was said in the previous debate that that is still little understood. In my experience, that is so in all sorts of ways. Good councils of all persuasions are now operating shadow councillor schemes. I have been shadowed myself by a number of people who are not necessarily interested in becoming a councillor but who are interested in knowing more about what is involved and how the system works. It seems to me, and to my noble friend in whose name the amendment stands, that a very important part of the duties here should be the duty to promote a better understanding of the work and role of a councillor, which is inherent in understanding the democratic functioning of local government. I believe that the Bill would benefit from an explicit reference to that.</p>

They hardly existed 20 years ago. All the signs are that they will not go away, but will become more important. It is impossible to draw a sensible map of the system of local governance without including all the partnership arrangements and partnership bodies, some of which exist as statutory bodies and some of which do not. Some just exist and have come about on a voluntary basis. The Government may say that they exist on a voluntary basis but local strategic partnerships are not really voluntary bodies. The Government say that we have to have them, but they have no basis in local government law. They play a different part in different areas, but they are important pretty well everywhere. Amendment 5 refers to local strategic partnerships and to crime and disorder reduction partnerships. Crime and disorder reduction partnerships are statutory bodies, but they are still partnerships of local bodies.</p>

Why is it essential that Wales be included? Could the National Assembly for Wales and its Government not be given these responsibilities and be able to fulfil them more effectively in Cardiff than we do in this capital city? The Bill tries to involve more people and communities in their local affairs. To put Wales and its responsibilities in the Bill is a backwards step. The amendment gives the people of Wales full authority on the matters in this measure: devolution. If we accept these amendments&#151;I am sure that the Minister looks favourably on them&#151;it will be a step forward in the devolution process for Wales. Do we trust the National Assembly for Wales and its Government? Are we going to help them move forward? By withdrawing the references to Wales, we would be doing that. We would be trusting the National Assembly for Wales Government, which was set up by the Labour Government 10 years ago. Why not move forward a little more? England has enough problems of its own.</p>
