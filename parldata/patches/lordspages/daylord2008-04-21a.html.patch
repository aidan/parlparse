That is not a principle that we have ever tried to follow, although maybe we should.</p>

If that is the feeling of the House, perhaps we should all see the material before Third Reading, but I do not think that we will change our view. The Government&#146;s contention is that by viewing it people are more likely to commit violent offences. Therefore, they justify walking into people&#146;s bedrooms and turning them into criminals simply for viewing something.</p>
