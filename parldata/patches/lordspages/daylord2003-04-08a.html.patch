 <a name="30408-20_para27"></a>Specialised services are defined by reference to the national specialised services definitions set, the first version of which was published in December 2001. Excluding the highly specialised national set, the definitions number 35 conditions and cover services provided to catchment populations of more than 1 million&#151;that is, those covering more than one primary care trust. They include burn care, rare cancers, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy surgery, hepatology, infectious diseases, perinatal pathology and psychotherapy specialised services.
