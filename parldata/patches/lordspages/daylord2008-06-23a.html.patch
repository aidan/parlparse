I believe that is right.</p>

I was trying to explain the starting proposition for whether any scheme is a qualifying scheme and an autoenrolment scheme. There are tests to be met for that. We discussed earlier that special provision would need to be made for non-UK schemes to see whether they are administered and provided in such a way that they can be brought within the ambit of the provisions of the Bill. It would be the same for hybrid schemes as for defined benefit or defined contributions schemes. I hope that deals with that point.</p>
