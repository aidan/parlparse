 <A NAME = "00209-04_para128"></a>I intend to be brief because much has already been said. In any case, I have tabled amendments for the remaining stages of the Bill tomorrow which I hope will also be constructive and brief. I support the Bill for two reasons. First, if the Bill is speedily implemented, it will protect the United Kingdom from censure, and possibly expulsion, from the European Union. The EU is now threatening Austria because 27 per cent of its electorate voted for the Freedom Party which does not contain convicted terrorists or rely on a terrorist wing. That is the situation as I understand it. In comparison, Her Majesty's Government have placed in government--we all share in this responsibility--those whose record is plain to see. For some reason, the Foreign Secretary has ignored the highly dangerous position in which Britain finds itself. None the less, the Bill will remove that fault, provided it is implemented speedily.

The report from the National Pollen Research Unit confirms existing knowledge about the distances which pollen can travel. However the findings are relevant to the dialogue between the GM and organic sectors which MAFF has promoted, and we have asked SCIMAC to take them into account in reviewing separation distances.
