 <p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08112046000189"></a>Enough of that gripe. I apologise to my noble friend for the length of it. What we are all saying in the debate&#151;certainly what I am saying&#151;is that we have had a lot of change but, for me, change never goes fast enough. However, let us look at the significant improvements to passengers and freight and the quality of the network achieved. Service quality and performance have been dramatically improved. Forecasts of growth&#151;I do not know whether they slow down&#151;are a nice challenge. I am sure that my noble friend and his team will meet that challenge and that we will move forward to see the growth and the investment necessary to achieve it.</p>

I declare myself also an amateur among all these rail professionals. I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Bradshaw for providing me with some very helpful briefing. However, I live in the north of England and I very much want to make a number of points in a debate about investment, which tends to be dominated by the demands of the south and south-east England.</p>
