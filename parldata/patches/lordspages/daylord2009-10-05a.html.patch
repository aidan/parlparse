It is for the Turkish courts to assess the evidence in the first instance.

As with other authorisations, it is for an applicant to provide the requisite information and the cost would not be met by the Environment Agency. A notice served under regulation 17(2) may require any information to be provided where that requirement is reasonable.</p>

The extent to which a claimant can complete any of these activities is measured against a series of graded descriptors. The same scoring system is applied to mental function and physical function, to ensure that the assessment is balanced across the two sections.</p>
