I had intended in my opening sentence to say what a good thing it was that this very important debate was now the last business and that therefore all the distinguished speakers would have a little more time for their contributions. I also thank everyone in advance for taking part in the debate. As this is my first opportunity to do so, I congratulate the Minister on returning to the Department of Health and on his promotion.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="070131108000159"></a>I congratulate the Government as a whole on their recent decision to develop an overall strategy on palliative care under the distinguished leadership of Professor Mike Richards. As the House will be aware, Professor Richards is the so-called cancer tsar for the NHS, but I understand that this project will extend well beyond cancer services to develop a much more general programme on how we look after people who are reaching the end of their lives.</p>
