The people in the Parliamentary Works and Services Department service both Houses and have a range of skilled staff at their disposal, including carpenters, upholsterers, electricians, plumbers, porters.

They are the ones who keep the system going at weekends and, particularly, in recesses, doing myriad jobs, ranging from checking for asbestos to putting in wiring, plumbing and everything else.

I join in thanks particularly to Valerie Sargent and Danae Wilkins, who have retired this year after long service. We are very well served here at all levels. We know it and we appreciate it&#151;I think that is trueof everyone in the House. The Clerk of the Parliaments&#151;known in some statutes, I gather, as the corporate officer&#151;and his colleagues are of course ever-helpful. Black Rod, the Yeoman-Usher and all their staff are also very helpful.</p>
