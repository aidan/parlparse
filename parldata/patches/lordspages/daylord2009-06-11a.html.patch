 <notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_759"></a><b>11 Jun 2009 : Column 759</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introducing simpler single-subject Bills, and allow Parliament to take time to heed and reflect on the views of interested parties and public opinion, to scrutinise the Bills properly, and to amend them where they need to be amended. That might mean a larger number of Bills coming to Parliament, but they would be smaller clearer Bills, each concentrating on a single purpose. That should give us lighter and more transparent legislative programmes, better parliamentary scrutiny of legislation, and probably less and certainly better legislation. This would give Members of both Houses of Parliament a renewed sense of the value of their work, and would help to restore public confidence in our governmental and parliamentary institutions. In short, I suggest that this modest proposal could be effected without legislation, and would be good for the Government, good for Parliament, and good for the country.</p>

In his helpful Explanatory Note, he emphasises the importance of discerning principles. I welcome that, because this debate must proceed philosophically by looking at certain principles. I should like therefore to discern and explore one particular principle from his Bill and apply it more broadly to this whole debate on constitutional renewal for which, as we have heard, the Prime Minister has called.</p>

If we do not want Parliament to do so, some independent think tank such as the Constitution Unit can be put in charge of gathering people&#146;s opinion.

The council discussed a progress report on these issues under the Czech presidency and took a decision on whether to refer legal questions concerning the court&#146;s structure to the European Court of Justice. The UK advocated referring these questions to the Court of Justice as soon as possible and urged a rapid reply from the court. Doing so would allow us to make progress on creating a more efficient, affordable and responsive European patent system, which would help boost European innovation and competitiveness.</p>
