One or two speeches were made against the entire concept, but I wish to emphasis again that the d&#146;Hondt formula is merely a mathematical formula for resolving difficulties on the allocation of places.</p>

This is done by adding the organisation to Schedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000, which lists proscribed organisations. An organisation is concerned in terrorism if it commits or participates in acts of terrorism, prepares for terrorism, promotes or encourages terrorism or is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</p>
