-<a name="41020-15_spnew7"></a><b> The Noble Earl said </b>  : We return to the validity of the home condition report. Here I am trying to help the Government to make it a more acceptable document. My amendment says that a home condition report must not be more than three months&#039; old when a property is marketed. That is an important provision in that it ties the date of the report to within three months of marketing. It will not however solve the problem of the shelf life of the home condition report, which will be of continued concern. It could be out of date within a few hours or days due to natural causes. However, I understand that the Government want to include this by regulations, so surely it ought to be on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.
