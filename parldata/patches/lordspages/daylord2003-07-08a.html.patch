 <a name="30708-07_para5"></a>On several issues on which the Government have moved in your Lordships' House, we have concentrated on the need to future proof the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, there is a concern that if the amendments were carried today, we would place in the Bill an unnecessary inflexibility on Ofcom's ability to act in the future. I ask the noble Lord, Lord McNally, to respond to the brief statement that the noble Lord made on Report with regard to similar amendments.

We are grateful that the Government have seen fit to table their own amendments which concede provision for Clause 356 to be extended to cover the possibility of supporting future community television. This is perhaps the minimum necessary for the Bill to recognise the increasingly converging nature of community media. With regard to our Amendments Nos. 74 and 77, I would like to make a couple of points. Amendment No. 74 specifies that in extending the fund to cover local digital television, it should be limited to services
