-<A NAME="10718w02_spmin3"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions   (Lord Falconer of Thorton): </B>  On 24 April, my honourable friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Beverley Hughes) announced the activation of the Bellwin scheme to provide emergency financial assistance to local authorities to help them meet some of the costs of responding to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease. This scheme is based on Section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, which permits only the reimbursement of expenditure incurred by local authorities on, or in connection with, the taking of immediate action to safeguard life or property, or to prevent suffering or severe inconvenience, in their area or among its inhabitants. Funding rate relief for small businesses does not, therefore, fall within the scope of this scheme.
