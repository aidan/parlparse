She will be aware that we are one of the most generous countries in Europe to the global fund. Others should follow us. I congratulate the Government on the national strain-typing service, which is to be opened in May. It will help with all sorts of TB strains. It will be in Newcastle, Birmingham and London. Does she agree that drug-resistant tuberculosis should be treated in negative-pressure isolation rooms? Do we have enough rooms, especially for children?</p>

However, we know that it is a problem across the world. Some 440,000 people across the world have drug-resistant TB. Our £1 billion and our commitment to international co-operation on this matter are extremely important.</p>
