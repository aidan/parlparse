-<A NAME="91018-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Park on Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that reply. However, may I urge the Government and the committees concerned to reconsider? I do so first because it will be vital that the servants of the House--the Doorkeepers, the Attendants and so forth--should have clear briefing as to what is to happen once the change has been made. Secondly, I suggest that it is part of the honour of this House that it should be seen to treat honourably and not shabbily those who are leaving and who have served it and the country well. It is all very well to say that the matter might be considered in the next Session, but by then the time will have come and gone. I urge the Government to reconsider.

 <A NAME = "91018-01_para5"></a>Furthermore, will the noble Baroness use this opportunity to correct press reports of remarks allegedly made by her at the Labour Party conference which, if they were truly reported--and they concern this matter--were, to say the least, graceless? I feel sure that as Leader of the whole House, she would never have spoken in that way. Will she now correct those reports?
