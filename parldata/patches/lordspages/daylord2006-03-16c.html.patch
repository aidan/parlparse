 <p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Gender inequality is thus not something that we can address down the track, or wait another generation or two before sorting out. We have to make the changes in the UK on which so many in this debate have done so much over many years, but we also have to take that onto a wider stage. We have to support those who are fighting for that millennium development goal of gender equality around the world. The implications of not addressing that are surely unthinkable.
