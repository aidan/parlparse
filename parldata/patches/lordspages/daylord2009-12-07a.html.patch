For this reason, the Government support the proposed EU Food Information Regulation currently under negotiation, which will address these issues. We are also meeting with representatives of food retailers, manufacturers and the food service sector to set out Defra's position and to actively encourage them to consider adopting measures on a shorter timescale on a voluntary basis.</p>

These rules require that when nutritional information is provided on salt content it must be declared as sodium, however because the term is not widely understood by consumers many manufacturers choose to additionally declare the equivalent value as salt.</p>
