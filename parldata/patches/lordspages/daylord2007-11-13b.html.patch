We respect Indonesia&#146;s territorial integrity and do not support Papuan independence. We believe that full implementation of existing special autonomy legislation is the best way to proceed towards a sustainable resolution to the internal differences and the long-term stability of Papua. The best way to resolve the complex issues in Papua is through promoting peaceful dialogue between Papuan groups and the Indonesian Government.</p>

Commercial links with Indonesia were allowed to stifle totally the legitimate claims of the indigenous West Papuan people to independence. We therefore have a particular responsibility to let the voice of these people, who are suffering massive human rights abuses, at least be heard in the councils of the UN.</p>

  My Lords, there is no legal or procedural impediment to raising the question either at the General Assembly or in the Security Council under Article 35 of the charter. Is it the Government&#146;s position that genocide should continue while the international community looks on? If so, what has become of the ethical foreign policy?</p>

  My Lords, the noble and learned Lord raises two separate points. First, while we are concerned by continuing human rights abuses in Papua&#151;we have highlighted them in this year&#146;s Foreign Office and government human rights report and raised them through our embassy in Jakarta&#151;we nevertheless believe that they are of a relatively small kind and do not in any way constitute the level of gravity that has just been implied. Secondly, because we do not accept that Papua should be independent, we would not consider it appropriate to raise the issue in the Security Council or General Assembly.</p>
