 <p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="1006141000136"></a>I restate our support for the mission in Afghanistan, which is, as the Prime Minister has rightly said, first and foremost to protect our national security. As this is the noble Lord's first Statement to this House on Afghanistan on behalf of the Prime Minister-and, therefore, the first occasion on which we have responded as the Official Opposition-I assure him that, as the Government proceed to take difficult decisions in the best interests of our mission in Afghanistan and of our troops, they will have our full support.</p>

There were quite a few and I do not pretend for one moment that I shall be able to answer all of them right now. She is only too aware of the difficulties in replying on behalf of the Prime Minister, who speaks in another place, while being asked questions here. However, I shall do my very best.</p>
