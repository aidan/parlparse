Obviously I am disappointed that she does not think that we could put this into legislation, but I quite understand the reasons that she has provided. I especially look forward to the review, and the Mental Health Act Commission and I will be very happy to work alongside Ministers and officials to strengthen the code of practice in this area. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
