The only thing to have changed since my visit there in October 2004 has been the exponential increase in the number of fatalities. It is estimated that as many as 400,000 people havenow died as a result of the attacks, and more than2.5 million people have been driven from their homes and now require international assistance. There is documented evidence of rape and enforced disappearances, and 90 per cent of the villages in Darfur have been razed to the ground. The genocide has been orchestrated and perpetrated by the Sudanese Government-backed Janjaweed militia.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07013074000184"></a>The All-Party Group on Sudan, of which I am an officer, has documented these atrocities on a daily basis. Many of your Lordships recently attended the excellent briefings provided by the BBC World Service, sponsored by the all-party group. During that briefing, reference was made to the fragile situation in the south and the deteriorating situation in the east. My noble friend Lady Cox, who will speak later, has just returned from Sudan and will talk about the interaction of the situation in Darfur with the unfolding events elsewhere in Sudan. I am grateful to her and to other noble Lords for bringing their considerable expertise to tonight&#146;s debate.</p>

 <p><a name="wa_stpa_183"></a><a name="07013061000241"></a>It is not yet clear whether the above average annual increase in 2005 and 2006 were primarily due to manmade or natural factors. Possible causes include hot dry summers in Europe and drought in Amazonia, with consequent widespread forest fires. It is too early to be confident that the recent trend towards increasing CO2 concentration will continue, though it is considered likely.</p>
