 <notus-date day="21" month="2" year="2007" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1106"></a><b>21 Feb 2007 : Column 1106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Where a complaint is purely about financial advice, for example, the ombudsman may decide, with the consent of the complainant, that it would be more appropriate to pass it on to the Financial Ombudsman Service under the scheme rules in Clause 130(3)(b). But where the complaint contains aspects covered by different jurisdictions, the OLC might want to consider the complaint and provide redress in the round. It is better to leave the jurisdiction as open as possible, albeit with the safeguards that we have put in Clauses 123 to 125, so that the ombudsman can take into account all the factors. We would not want to see a genuine complaint excluded because the aspect being complained about was not quality of legal service, but simply quality of service; for example, the legal advice was fine but the lawyer was rude or condescending or whatever reasons might be given.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07022162000013"></a>I am also keen for consumers not to have to try to work out to whom they should complain. We want there to be a one-stop shop and for the ombudsman to determine where best that complaint should go. Although I understand the principle behind what the noble Lord is seeking to achieve, I expect the ombudsman to be looking primarily at legal complaints. I do not want to reach the point where the consumer is unable to raise complaints and have the ombudsman look at them in the round, work with others or pass them on as appropriate.</p>
