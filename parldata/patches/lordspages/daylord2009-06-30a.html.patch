 <p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09063064000012"></a>This is a missed opportunity from a Government who have run out of steam. The proposals bring nothing but more bureaucracy, tinkering and meddling. The Government&#146;s own report card would state &#147;grade F&#148;. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I congratulate the Government on the investments that they have made in the schools system, which has led to some improvement. However, unlike the Minister, I would claim that we have always had state schools which have been as good as the best in the private sector. I have always been something of an apologist for state schools and we have many to be proud of.</p>
