 <p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="07101040000043"></a>The MoD does not have access to medical or other health records of Gulf veterans who have left the Armed Forces. Routine monitoring of the health of these veterans is therefore not possible. The only illness for which central records are kept is cancer.</p>
