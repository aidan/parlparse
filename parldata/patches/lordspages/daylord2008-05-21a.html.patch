 <p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08052188000056"></a>I assure the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, that I personally see this as an urgent matter, and Her Majesty&#146;s Government do the same. I am surprised if the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, thinks that I am not bringing to it my usual degree of enthusiasm in these matters. Perhaps I could take noble Lords back to my time at the CBI when I was director-general. Having listened to the debate today, I give noble Lords on all sides of the House some fabulous qualifications in hindsight. At times, we at the CBI just never saw the initiative and support from either side of the political domain for this enormously important issue. I am new to this House, so I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I am not allowed to say this, but I have heard some things tonight from other Benches that have made me think, &#147;You do have a nerve&#148;.</p>
