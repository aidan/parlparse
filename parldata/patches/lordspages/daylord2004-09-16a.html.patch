-<a name="40916-03_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Brook of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, as we have a moment to spare, may I commend to the Treasury Bench a novel system of self-assessment? When my late noble kinsman was Financial Secretary to the Treasury, 50 years ago, he received a letter from an anonymous taxpayer. It said that he had been losing much sleep and had come to the conclusion that the loss of sleep was caused by his inaccurate tax reporting. He enclosed a banker&#039;s draft for &#163;50,000 and added a postscript saying that if he continued to lose sleep, he would send some more.
