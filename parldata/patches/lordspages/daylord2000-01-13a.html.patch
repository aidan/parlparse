 <A NAME = "00113-02_para4"></a>There were a number of items for discussion and several suggestions came from members who wanted ad hoc committees set up. The subject was deferred until the autumn. I am aware that the autumn has passed, but it should be borne in mind that until late in the year there was some confusion in your Lordships' House about who would be here. I believe that that is one of the reasons for the delay.

-<A NAME="00113-03_spnew2"></A><B> The Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees: </B>   My Lords, I cannot give a definitive answer. There are restrictions in terms of rooms, support from the Clerks and membership. However, that is changing with the increasing membership of your Lordships' House. Speaking as chairman of the European Communities Committee, after a difficult period during the summer when we did not know who would be available, we managed to staff and fill all the places on the Select Committees and the sub-committees. If rumour is true that there is to be a further infusion of new Members, I am sure that the task will become easier. However, the Clerks of this House have been seriously overworked in recent times. The situation has improved, but, as the noble Lord will know, some Clerks in the Committee corridor have run two committees, which is more than flesh and blood can stand.
