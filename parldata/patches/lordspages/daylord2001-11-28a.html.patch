 <a name="11128w06_para11"></a>The report represents a significant achievement. For the first time, representatives of all 15 member states have signed up to a document setting out in detail the actions that need to be undertaken in order to improve Europe's regulatory environment. It contains a number of concrete, practical recommendations and an action plan with realistic timings. In particular, the action plan asks the Commission to: establish a new, comprehensive impact assessment system, covering all Commission regulatory proposals, by June 2002; establish a central web-based consultation register for all EU consultations by June 2002; adopt a standard minimum 16-week consultation period from March 2002; spearhead a 40 per cent reduction in the volume of Community acts by June 2004, arising from a concerted codification of European legislation by the Institutions; launch a new targeted simplification programme by June 2002 of existing European legislation in all areas; and create throughout the Commission a centrally supported, effective network for better regulation by June 2002.
