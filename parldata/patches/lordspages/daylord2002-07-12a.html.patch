 <a name="20712-01_para144"></a>By such errors of omission and commission, the Bill threatens all the theoretical economic foundations on which the Chancellor's framework is built, of which the Minister is so proud. The framework's main pillars&#151;the independence of the Bank of England, the symmetrical inflation target and the code of fiscal stability&#151;are all much less solid than the Minister may like to think.

Under the terms of its lease, MDL is the responsible body for its inspection and maintenance. No inspections of the installation have been carried out by Torbay Council. The council is however undertaking a review of its arrangements for inspection under health and safety legislation following the introduction of new requirements by the HSE earlier this year and this will lead to a new risk assessed regime.
