 <a name="20709-05_para57"></a>Several questions are left open. I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, about how the Government propose to deal with the gap in savings. The industry cannot do it. Sandler opposes tax incentives. The Government oppose compulsion. What is left? Do the Government have a target, and can the Minister tell us what it is? Can the Minister give an outline of the Government's strategy to fill the gap?

-<a name="20709-05_para58"></a>How is consumer confidence in financial advice to be restored? Will the Government consider radical options, such as asking&#151;or telling&#151;the industry to get together with the citizens advice bureaux to promote a nation-wide pro bono financial advice service? How is the confidence of consumers who have been seriously ripped off to be restored? When will the Government-sponsored Penrose report be available, so that we can draw a line under the Equitable Life deÿbacle? If the Government will not agree to a comprehensive review of the mis-selling of endowment mortgages, will they, at least, name and shame the main culprits? When will the Government introduce new rules for orphan assets that will prevent companies from expropriating policyholders' funds for their shareholders?

-I still do not get it. Either we were being naÿve when we all agreed that there should be something called "independent financial advice"&#151;not realising that we were not told about commissions and so on&#151;or there is something naÿve in the Statement in that advice must be an adjunct to the sale or else there is no profit in the adviser giving the advice.

 <a name="20709-06_para6"></a>Ten or 15 years ago the advice I received from Lloyd's Bank was probably more reasonable from my point of view than the advice I am allowed to get today. Either Lloyd's Bank will tell me what it is selling or I shall go to someone else who may or may not tell me the basis on which he or she is selling. Are we moving forward&#151;I hope that the answer is in the affirmative; that is why I am asking the question in this slightly barbed tone&#151;to a position where the average punter can believe that there is something called "independent financial advice" which is not intended for any other motivation?
