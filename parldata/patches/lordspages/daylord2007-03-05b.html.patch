They have continued down the same primrose path. We now have before us the Serious Crime Bill, which uses exactly the same defective process&#151;no longer in relation to terrorism but in relation to serious crime, and not even crime that is serious: in some cases it is not even crime at all, just people who are thought to be or suspected of being on the fringes of serious crime. It has been universally condemned by Liberty, Justice and, above all, in very measured words by the Select Committee on the Constitution. I shall read part of the last paragraph of its report:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0703058000234"></a>&#147;A broad question for the House is whether the use of civil orders in an attempt to prevent serious criminal activity is a step too far in the development of preventative orders. Whether or not the trend towards greater use of preventative civil orders is constitutionally legitimate (a matter on which we express doubt), we take the view that SCPOs represent an incursion into the liberty of the subject and constitute a form of punishment that cannot be justified in the absence of a criminal conviction&#148;.</p>
+</ul>
+<p><a name="0703058000208"></a>Every word of that applies equally to the control orders that we are being asked to renew today.</p>

That will not do. It is not good enough to write to us. We need to know today the Home Office&#146;s responses to the five main issues that we raised in our report. That may seem unreasonable since the report was published only yesterday, but it is not, because the Government managed to arrange matters in the other place in such a way that there was precious little time even to consider the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. Most of the issues raised in the report of the Joint

Anyone who reads those judgments, as I have done, will have a sense of dismay that we have come to this situation in a country that prides itself upon the rule of law. On behalf of the committee, if I may, I say that we expect the Minister to reply today to the main issues within our report that have been so clearly summarised by my noble friend Lord Judd.</p>

My noble friend is a great man, a great lawyer, a great public figure and a great statesman, but even he would not say that compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights was his task and his report did not deal with that. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, which is not controlled by the Government and is all-party and beyond party, has a distinguished, specialised legal adviser and its report cannot simply be brushed aside as recent or as in some way eclipsed by the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. I respectfully insist that when the Minister replies she deals with our main points.</p>

Last month, it published <I>Fundamental Justice in Extraordinary Times: Main Report of the Special Senate Committee on the Anti-Terrorism Act</I>, a 147-page report. I hope that the Home Office has studied that report. If it has&#151;I am sure some of its staff will have, and Ministers may have been told about it&#151;it will know that that committee looked at the special advocate procedure operating in this country. It was not impressed and made an important recommendation, with which I agree. Recommendation 8 states:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0703058000236"></a>&#147;That the special advocate be able to communicate with the party affected by the proceeding, and his or her counsel, after receiving confidential information and attending in camera hearings, and that the government establish clear guidelines and policies to ensure the secrecy of information in the interests of national security&#148;.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0703058000154"></a>At all events, there are extremely serious issues about due process. We say in our report that we consider that the,</p>
+<ul><a name="0703058000256"></a>&#147;due process standards should apply to the more restrictive non-derogative orders in view of the severity of the restrictions they contain&#148;.</ul>

+<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0703058000155"></a>The next point to which my colleague and friend the noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred was prosecution. That again is a very serious matter indeed. The judgment of the High Court in the case of E provides powerful evidence&#151;and we cite others in our report&#151;on our concerns about the seriousness of the Government&#146;s commitment to prosecuting as their first preference. I know that the Minister has said that that would be their first preference, but looking at the evidence we are not satisfied that it is, and the judgment of the High Court confirms our concern. We point out that:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0703058000237"></a>&#147;The lack of effective systems to keep the prospects of prosecution under review, revealed by this case, belies the Government's professed commitment to do so&#148;.</p>

+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0703058000238"></a>&#147;In our view, the Government&#146;s explanation that individuals who have absconded from control orders or disappeared do not pose a threat to the public raises questions about whether control orders are being used for the purposes for which Parliament was told they were necessary during the passage of the 2005 Act, namely to protect the public from the risk of harm by suspected terrorists ...

-<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0703058000144"></a>One would have thought that in relation to using this civil process, the Government might have learnt something from the past, but they have not. They have continued down the same primrose path. We now have before us the Serious Crime Bill, which uses exactly the same defective process&#151;no longer in relation to terrorism but in relation to serious crime, and not even crime that is serious: in some cases it is not even crime at all, just people who are thought to be or suspected of being on the fringes of serious crime. It has been universally condemned by Liberty, Justice and, above all, in very measured words by the Select Committee on the Constitution. I shall read part of the last paragraph of its report:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0703058000234"></a>&#147;A broad question for the House is whether the use of civil orders in an attempt to prevent serious criminal activity is a step too far in the development of preventative orders. Whether or not the trend towards greater use of preventative civil orders is constitutionally legitimate (a matter on which we express doubt), we take the view that SCPOs represent an incursion into the liberty of the subject and constitute a form of punishment that cannot be justified in the absence of a criminal conviction&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="0703058000208"></a>Every word of that applies equally to the control orders that we are being asked to renew today.</p>

The judgment of the High Court in the case of E provides powerful evidence&#151;and we cite others in our report&#151;on our concerns about the seriousness of the Government&#146;s commitment to prosecuting as their first preference. I know that the Minister has said that that would be their first preference, but looking at the evidence we are not satisfied that it is, and the judgment of the High Court confirms our concern. We point out that:</p>

Therefore, even if we were able to use it, which is not admitted, it is likely that there would still be cases that would fall outwith the realm of prosecution. We would still have to look at what regime we need to put in place to deal with those few but important cases. It is for that reason that we have changed many things. I accept and acknowledge the comments made by noble Lords about the introduction of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. We have not stood still but have changed things and brought in new legislation. We have demonstrated this with the new offences introduced by the Terrorism Act 2006 which have already been used in prosecutions, with around 20 individuals charged under such offences by the end of December 2006. Of our four legislative proposals raised during the debate in the other place, two are already in place&#151;the threshold test and the plea bargaining for supergrasses&#151;and the other two&#151;the intercept as evidence and post-charge questioning&#151;are under active consideration.</p>

Control orders remain the best option. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lester, for bringing the developments with the Supreme Court judgment in Canada on Friday of last week to my attention. I reassure him that I was in Canada talking about this very issue with my Canadian counterparts last week, and about how we move forward. We will look with great care at what the Supreme Court says in that decision.</p>

I assure your Lordships that it is by far the easier course if the evidence is there to prosecute. We have an independent Crown Prosecution Service and police who are undertaking that. One must of course take their advice into account and, in effect, be bound by it. The Government, as noble Lords will know, do not prosecute matters themselves. Post-charge questioning has also been raised. We are looking at it, as we are looking at a number of other issues.</p>

I know that the noble Lord seeks to lure me into it, but I am obliged to resist that temptation, although I am certainly more than happy to give an outline of where we are. The noble Lord will know that, by the normal processes, we have a little time to consider and digest what has been said, and show the committee the respect that its report deserves before responding. On other occasions, the Government have been severely criticised&#151;I am trying to remember whether that was by the noble Lord&#151;for precipitously responding to a report without giving it mature and considered reflection.</p>

The Government are putting us in a position where either we approve this order or there is a void. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has done its best to produce a report to inform this House today, so that the House can consider the five main issues I have referred to. We are not asking for a full reply today, but surely the least the Minister can do is summarise the Government&#146;s reasons for rejecting all five of the main concerns&#151;the Government would have to do that to satisfy the House&#151;so that the House is well informed. Otherwise, the House is in the position that an expert Select Committee has produced a full report and the Home Office cannot help as to how to reply to those issues. They are not difficult issues and they have been raised again and again in cases and in the past. I therefore urge the Minister at least to give us the heading replies in short form so that we can understand the Government&#146;s position.</p>

The noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Lester, and others asked about the delay in publication of the definition of terrorism and the report. Your Lordships will know that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, received the report at the Home Office on 7 January. There has been a need to consult other departments on the contents of the report and we intend to publish the report and the Government&#146;s response in the near future.

-<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07030520000008"></a>However, it is right to say that intercept evidence is not a panacea. Therefore, even if we were able to use it, which is not admitted, it is likely that there would still be cases that would fall outwith the realm of prosecution. We would still have to look at what regime we need to put in place to deal with those few but important cases. It is for that reason that we have changed many things. I accept and acknowledge the comments made by noble Lords about the introduction of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. We have not stood still but have changed things and brought in new legislation. We have demonstrated this with the new offences introduced by the Terrorism Act 2006 which have already been used in prosecutions, with around 20 individuals charged under such offences by the end of December 2006. Of our four legislative proposals raised during the debate in the other place, two are already in place&#151;the threshold test and the plea bargaining for supergrasses&#151;and the other two&#151;the intercept as evidence and post-charge questioning&#151;are under active consideration.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07030520000009"></a>Even with all the changes already made or proposed, however, a small number of cases will remain where prosecution is just not possible, as I said earlier. Control orders remain the best option. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lester, for bringing the developments with the Supreme Court judgment in Canada on Friday of last week to my attention. I reassure him that I was in Canada talking about this very issue with my Canadian counterparts last week, and about how we move forward. We will look with great care at what the Supreme Court says in that decision.</p>

He will know that a decision was also made in the Supreme Court on Friday. Whether the special advocate should have additional issues is a matter of some interest. Of course we will look at that and take it into consideration. It is perhaps important to acknowledge that there is an implicit acceptance that the special advocate procedure might have a certain degree of utility and support.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07030520000012"></a>I of course hear the issue of how prosecution is addressed and confess disappointment at the lack of belief that the Government are energetically pursuing it. I assure your Lordships that it is by far the easier course if the evidence is there to prosecute. We have an independent Crown Prosecution Service and police who are undertaking that. One must of course take their advice into account and, in effect, be bound by it. The Government, as noble Lords will know, do not prosecute matters themselves. Post-charge questioning has also been raised. We are looking at it, as we are looking at a number of other issues.</p>

I know that the noble Lord seeks to lure me into it, but I am obliged to resist that temptation, although I am certainly more than happy to give an outline of where we are. The noble Lord will know that, by the normal processes, we have a little time to consider and digest what has been said, and show the committee the respect that its report deserves before responding. On other occasions, the Government have been severely criticised&#151;I am trying to remember whether that was by the noble Lord&#151;for precipitously responding to a report without giving it mature and considered reflection.</p>

The Government are putting us in a position where either we approve this order or there is a void. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has done its best to produce a report to inform this House today, so that the House can consider the five main issues I have referred to. We are not asking for a full reply today, but surely the least the Minister can do is summarise the Government&#146;s reasons for rejecting all five of the main concerns&#151;the Government would have to do that to satisfy the House&#151;so that the House is well informed. Otherwise, the House is in the position that an expert Select Committee has produced a full report and the Home Office cannot help as to how to reply to those issues. They are not difficult issues and they have been raised again and again in cases and in the past. I therefore urge the Minister at least to give us the heading replies in short form so that we can understand the Government&#146;s position.</p>

If I cannot satisfy him, I apologise in advance and of course the full reply will be forthcoming in due course. Before I turn to the JCHR, I will deal with matters in chronological order. The noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Lester, and others asked about the delay in publication of the definition of terrorism and the report. Your Lordships will know that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, received the report at the Home Office on 7 January. There has been a need to consult other departments on the contents of the report and we intend to publish the report and the Government&#146;s response in the near future. We hope that in so doing

In spite of all that has gone on in welfare reform and the progress that has been made, we still have well over 2 million people stuck on incapacity benefits for more than a year, 500,000 lone parents with school-age children out of work and on benefits, and one-third of JSA claimants who have spent more time on benefits than in work. So there are still some real issues to address, and we believe that the Freud report is a contribution to addressing them. But we need to come back, and will come back, with our detailed comments and thoughts on these proposals.</p>

There is no suggestion that everyone will be forced into 12 hours of nightshift work, or anything of that nature. It needs to be sensitive and sensible&#151;otherwise it is not going to work.</p>

It is a huge and important debate, and we need to ensure that the support is there to help people towards work and eventually into it. But it will not be easy. There is no silver bullet that will produce that result; it needs investment and people working alongside individuals and employers&#151;and that is part of what comes out of this review.</p>

The age group of 11 to 16 is a vulnerable one, when too many good children are drawn like magnets to gangs and bad company, and the last thing that we want is more children hanging around on street corners. Can the Minister assure the House that as well as appropriate childcare&#151;and I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;there will also be appropriate activities for that 11-to- 16 age group after school, such as sport, that will keep them engaged and involved?</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07030520000090"></a>Do the Government accept that the principal lesson of Wisconsin is that it is essential that all the components of support are in place for those people who find it very hard to get and hold down a job? Skills training, retraining and the childcare that has been mentioned should be available, as should assistance with substance abuse and other health problems, and with disability and housing problems. It is particularly important that assistance is given with transport problems. Welfare providers will need to have the resources to provide a coherent pattern of support. If one of those elements of support is missing, the chances that the person trying to hold down a job will succeed in doing so for more than a short time are poor. They need to be able to access this range of support at least through a single gateway. What particular help have the Government in mind to give to lone parents who have been out of the labour market for a very long time and for whom the transition to work will effectively be just as difficult whether their youngest child is 12 or 16? Finally, is it envisaged that there will be discretion so that welfare providers, looking at all the circumstances of a particular family, could say&#151;</p>

The Government believe that it would be wrong to rush into a decision on this matter until we are satisfied that any proposals will work as intended and that they are comprehensive and effective. Therefore, this Bill is only a paving measure to ensure that, should the Government go ahead with the planning-gain supplement, the infrastructure to build the systems to support it can be put in place and tested well in advance of any introduction&#151;which, we have said, would not be before 2009. I am sure that the House will recognise that, should we go ahead with a workable and effective policy, a workable and effective IT system to support it would be equally important.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07030520000099"></a>The prospective operation of a planning-gain supplement has been widely debated during consideration of this preparations Bill in the other place. It is worth setting out the aims of the issue before us. Planning-gain supplement aims to help facilitate the creation of new development and economic growth by providing additional resources to finance the critical infrastructure&#151;from roads and transport to schools and health facilities&#151;needed to make growing communities sustainable. It is important to point out that the planning-gain supplement should not be seen in isolation. This Government have implemented important reforms to bring forward more land for housing, and planning-gain supplement is part of a broader agenda.</p>

There is no suggestion that everyone will be forced into 12 hours of nightshift work, or anything of that nature. It needs to be sensitive and sensible&#151;otherwise it is not going to work.</p>

It is a huge and important debate, and we need to ensure that the support is there to help people towards work and eventually into it. But it will not be easy. There is no silver bullet that will produce that result; it needs investment and people working alongside individuals and employers&#151;and that is part of what comes out of this review.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale said, the main responsibility of lone parents is to their children. The age group of 11 to 16 is a vulnerable one, when too many good children are drawn like magnets to gangs and bad company, and the last thing that we want is more children hanging around on street corners. Can the Minister assure the House that as well as appropriate childcare&#151;and I absolutely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;there will also be appropriate activities for that 11-to- 16 age group after school, such as sport, that will keep them engaged and involved?</p>

I cannot from the Dispatch Box list all the things and opportunities that will be available more generally. However, the noble Baroness is right: unless there are opportunities for people within that age group and others to be engaged, this measure will not work as it should.</p>

Will he, however, take this opportunity to confirm that the Government have no intention whatever of emulating the excessively harsh, indeed cruel, withdrawal of benefits under the American system?</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07030520000090"></a>Do the Government accept that the principal lesson of Wisconsin is that it is essential that all the components of support are in place for those people who find it very hard to get and hold down a job? Skills training, retraining and the childcare that has been mentioned should be available, as should assistance with substance abuse and other health problems, and with disability and housing problems. It is particularly important that assistance is given with transport problems. Welfare providers will need to have the resources to provide a coherent pattern of support. If one of those elements of support is missing, the chances that the person trying to hold down a job will succeed in doing so for more than a short time are poor. They need to be able to access this range of support at least through a single gateway. What particular help have the Government in mind to give to lone parents who have been out of the labour market for a very long time and for whom the transition to work will effectively be just as difficult whether their youngest child is 12 or 16? Finally, is it envisaged that there will be discretion so that welfare providers, looking at all the circumstances of a particular family, could say&#151;</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07030520000097"></a>As has been recognised by the Treasury Select Committee of the other place, the Government have approached Kate Barker&#146;s recommendation of a planning-gain supplement from her review of housing supply in 2004 with the utmost diligence and seriousness. The Government welcome the active parliamentary interest of both Houses in the planning-gain supplement. Development affects us all and I think noble Lords will agree with me that it is only right and proper that local communities should benefit from that development in some way.</p>

The Government believe that it would be wrong to rush into a decision on this matter until we are satisfied that any proposals will work as intended and that they are comprehensive and effective. Therefore, this Bill is only a paving measure to ensure that, should the Government go ahead with the planning-gain supplement, the infrastructure to build the systems to support it can be put in place and tested well in advance of any introduction&#151;which, we have said, would not be before 2009. I am sure that the House will recognise that, should we go ahead with a workable and effective policy, a workable and effective IT system to support it would be equally important.</p>

It is worth setting out the aims of the issue before us. Planning-gain supplement aims to help facilitate the creation of new development and economic growth by providing additional resources to finance the critical infrastructure&#151;from roads and transport to schools and health facilities&#151;needed to make growing communities sustainable. It is important to point out that the planning-gain supplement should not be seen in isolation. This Government have implemented important reforms to bring forward more land for housing, and planning-gain supplement is part of a broader agenda.</p>

If we are to change this attitude we must persuade people that they will see genuine visible benefits coming back to them from development in their area. A regionally administered system does little to provide reassurance; there is nothing to stop money being redirected towards another corner of the region, remote from the original community. The Government have also failed to address fundamental questions about cross-border implementation and working of the tax, a hotly debated issue in the other place.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07030526000033"></a>It is well known that people tend to be pro-building projects as long as they are not in their own backyard. If we are to change this attitude we must persuade people that they will see genuine visible benefits coming back to them from development in their area. A regionally administered system does little to provide reassurance; there is nothing to stop money being redirected towards another corner of the region, remote from the original community. The Government have also failed to address fundamental questions about cross-border implementation and working of the tax, a hotly debated issue in the other place.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07030526000034"></a>On top of this, the National Housing Federation has pointed out that the planning-gain supplement is likely to hinder, rather than help, the creation of affordable housing:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="07030526000047"></a>&#147;By charging PGS on affordable housing, the Treasury will simply be pushing money around the public funding system ... If PGS is levied on housing associations, a proportion of Housing Corporation grant for social housing will effectively be paid back to the Treasury via PGS, and fewer homes will be provided. Moving funds from one part of the public purse to another is not efficient&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="07030526000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, found a number of people opposed to this whole process. He quoted the CBI, and I add the British Chambers Of Commerce and the Local Government Association. All have reservations about the proposals, and a consortium of companies involved in property development commissioned research which concluded that PGS was unlikely to deliver the increased funding for investment in infrastructure, was likely to reduce the supply of smaller development sites, and would be likely to change the way some sites are developed as developers seek to minimise their PGS liabilities.</p>

Her case for wrongful dismissal is dragging interminably through the Luxembourg court and she, for all these pains, is unable to find another job. No one wants to irritate the corrupt and powerful beast in Brussels, do they? In voicing this support for Mrs Andreasen, perhaps I may also ask the chairman of the sub-committee, the noble Lord, Lord Radice, why her supplementary memorandum, submitted in correction of the misleading and damaging evidence given by the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, was not printed with the report? If it is true that a Clerk lost her e-mail, sent in before the end of July and after the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, on 25 July, why could it not have been included with the evidence instead of being referred to in a footnote on page 113? If the footnote could be printed, why not the memo? Why was it made available only in hard copy upon application to the Clerk? Why was it not even available on e-mail? I shall put a copy of the memorandum in question in the Library of the House and will assume, unless I am contradicted, that anyone who wants a copy can get one electronically from cookaj@parliament.uk&#151;who, incidentally, is not the Clerk who lost the original. This is a very important document. Not only does it put Mrs Andreasen&#146;s side of the case made so improperly against her; but, in

As I am not a chartered accountant, I have been guided in what I am about to say by some eminent practitioners in the field, principally Mr Andrew Hamilton FCA, who heads up his own successful practice in Edinburgh, and Mr Hugh Williams FCA, who has also published widely and is a senior partner of an award-winning firm in Plymouth. They have advised me to concentrate in the time available on one particular accounting matter in order to demonstrate the seriousness of the situation in Brussels and thus the inadequacy of the committee&#146;s report. So I will pass in unaccustomed and frustrated silence over the lack of respect for standard accounting principles such as double-entry bookkeeping and accrual accounting; the lack of security in the accounting system; poor internal controls with no one taking responsibility for sound financial management, with the chief accounting officer not even signing off the accounts; failings with the budgets; risks with advance payments; and the whole system wide open to fraud. No, I will resist all that and concentrate instead on the small matter of what has happened to &#8364;28 billion.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07030531000025"></a>I am indebted to Mr Hamilton for raising this interesting question after he manfully struggled through the 139 pages of the Commission&#146;s annual accounts for 2005 together with the accompanying 228 pages of the Court of Auditors&#146; negative report. The experience made him an immediate and avid devotee of Marta Andreasen, of course, and his discoveries brought him to the attention of that great Euro-sceptic luminary, Mr Christopher Booker of the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I>. On 28 January this year Mr Booker duly wrote in his column about Mr Hamilton&#146;s analysis:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07030531000037"></a>&#147;Although the Commission&#146;s operating revenue for 2005 was given, with implausible precision, as &#8364;107,890,098,965.56, it was impossible to discover where most of this money had come from or gone to, because the accounts do not use the double-entry system used by every corner shop. They are just a maze of meaningless figures. For instance, a figure for the EU&#146;s &#145;long-term and short-term pre-financing&#146; suddenly goes up from zero to &#8364;28 billion without explanation&#148;.</p>
+</ul>
+<p><a name="07030531000034"></a>This version of events was too much for Mr Brian Gray, the successor to Mrs Andreasen and the Commission&#146;s present chief accounting officer. Incidentally, he moved up from being the head of the Commission&#146;s two biggest spending departments, agriculture and regional aid. Mr Gray fired back a letter to the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> on 4 February thus:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="07030531000038"></a>&#147;Long and short term pre-financing have not &#145;shot up&#146; from zero to &#8364;28 billion. Since 2005 the EU&#146;s balance sheet has had a different format to take account of the move from cash-based to accrual-based accounting standards, in line with the way British authorities now record their own financial situation&#148;.</p>
+</ul>
+<p><a name="07030531000035"></a>Mr Hamilton, Mr Williams and their accounting fraternity generally just could not believe this. Together with 12 other high-powered accountants and lawyers, they replied to Mr Gray as follows in the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> of 11 February:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="07030531000039"></a>&#147;As experienced chartered accountants and lawyers, we are amazed by the letter from Mr Brian Gray, the European Commission&#146;s chief accountant, defending the EU&#146;s accounting system. On

What does he not understand about the 2005 Court of Auditors&#146; 228-page audit report which explains in minute detail all the errors, mistakes and irregularities of which the Commission are guilty?</p>

+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="07030531000040"></a>&#147;On the matter of the &#8364;28 billion omitted from the 2004 accounts, Mr Gray attributes this to a change of accounting policy (from cash to accruals). Begging his pardon, but he is either incompetent or disingenuous. The &#8364;28 billion pre-financing sum should have been recorded as a &#8364;28 billion asset in the 2004 Commission accounts regardless of which accounting system was in operation. The very fact that it was not recorded as a cash-related asset in the 2004 accounts gives the lie to Mr Gray&#146;s claim that, &#145;The EU&#146;s general accounts have always been double-entry&#146;. Small wonder that the Court of Auditors continues to have no faith in the EC accounts&#148;.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07030531000026"></a>The questions my accountant friends would like me to put through the Government to the Commission are these. The UK sends many billions of pounds every year to Brussels, so I would have thought that the Government are entitled to some form of answer, particularly when the Commission&#146;s 2004 balance sheet has been understated by some 25 per cent. It has nothing to do with a change in accounting policy, but is just a typical example of the EU&#146;s complete disregard for financial probity.</p>
 
+<a name="70305-0012.htm_para3"></a>
+<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07030531000027"></a>The first question is this. Why was the &#8364;28 billion pre-financing figure not recorded as an asset in the Commission&#146;s 2004 accounts? After all, it was cash. Secondly, in the absence of a double-entry system to record pre-financing charges, how do we know that the figure is &#8364;28 billion and not, shall we say, 28 cents? Thirdly, is it true that the pre-financing figures are collected by means of a spreadsheet for completion by the member states themselves, and if so, who checks the figures? Fourthly, are these figures reconciled by the Commission to their own accounting records, and if not, why not? Fifthly, why has Mr Brian Gray, the Commission&#146;s chief accountant, said publicly that the &#8364;28 billion pre-financing figure was excluded from the Commission&#146;s 2004 accounts because it was not cash? Surely if anyone should know that pre-financing charges are de facto cash, it should be the chief accountant.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07030531000028"></a>I am sorry to direct these questions to the Minister, who cannot be held responsible for this report, but he is a member of a Government who continue to support our subservience to Brussels through our membership of the European Union&#151;very expensive subservience, too.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07030531000029"></a>I conclude with one suggestion for Her Majesty&#146;s Government. Surely it must by now be obvious that the Commission and other EU institutions are not going to do anything to sort out the ongoing accounting shambles and vulnerability to fraud. They have been promising to do so for a long time, but nothing has been done. I remember Mr Kenneth Clarke, when Chancellor of the Exchequer some 14 years ago, coming before your Lordships&#146; Select Committee, upon which I then sat, and assuring us that all these problems&#151;which were the same then as now&#151;would be sorted out by a

+<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07030531000030"></a>We should also not forget that, despite the Eurocrats&#146; best attempts thorough multi-million euro propaganda campaigns in schools and across the continent of Europe, there is still no European demos, and there will not be for any time to come. Thus there can be no European democracy to hold the freeloaders to account, and so the system rolls on regardless. But people do not feel strongly enough to protest, and anyway they have no influence in appointing or dismissing the principal villains, who are the Commission.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07030531000031"></a>My suggestion is simply that the Government should insist that one of the larger firms of international chartered accountants should be given the task of sorting the whole thing out. Of course the Commission would refuse such an idea, but if the Government got together with one or two other member states that were large donors to the EU and refused to send any more money until such a firm had been appointed, I fancy that would have the desired effect. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reaction to this idea.</p>

Europhobes might actually like this joke, so maybe I could expect a laugh from the other side. There are these two wealthy businessmen, and they are talking about how they have made their fortunes from EU funds. One is from western Europe, and the other is from what used to be eastern Europe. The one from western Europe takes his friend to his country and says, &#147;You see that stretch of road? I got &#8364;10 million to fund that, and it only cost &#8364;5 million to build. You go figure the implications&#148;. Then the one from eastern Europe takes his friend to his country and says, &#147;You see that road?&#148;. The one from western Europe says, &#147;What road?&#148;&#151;because there is no road there. The guy from eastern Europe says, &#147;I got &#8364;10 million in EU funds to construct that road. You go figure the implications&#148;.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07030533000003"></a>Unlike the previous speaker, I have no quarrel with most of this report. I shall make five brief comments upon it. First, it is surely right to say that the current state of audit of the EU budget is a serious problem. It is regularly used, as we can see from the previous speech, by those who seek to bash the EU. The issues are well put in the Treasury&#146;s memorandum of evidence in the second volume of the report, where it says that the audit methodology is very precise and hence it tends to be used as a negative assessment&#151;in other words, as the memorandum says, the bar has been set

The memorandum also says something more qualified: the quality of financial management is consistently not good enough. We have to ask why that should be so.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07030533000004"></a>Secondly, however, as the report correctly indicates and previous speakers have noted, the major difficulties happen at the level of member states, since most of the funds are allocated to, and spent by, them. I would see the issue here as a bit like that of the Lisbon agenda as it relates to the structural issue of the European Union. You have the European Commission, which is nominally the government of Europe, but a lot of what the Commission wants to do is determined by powers that remain in the hands of the member nations. I will come back to that in a minute.</p>

+<a name="70305-0012.htm_para11"></a>
+<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07030533000005"></a>Thirdly, I am not sure whether I should say this, but I only got my job as director of the LSE because the Comptroller and Auditor-General, Sir John Bourn, decided he did not want it. Maybe he did not want to face all the fractious academics you have to deal with. Anyway, it is interesting that, as was previously mentioned, he says that he could not have signed off our national accounts using this system&#151;again, surely an expression of the fact that the bar has been set very high. I find his comment interesting. He says:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07030533000027"></a>&#147;By setting a test which is so high, when you explain or put this out publicly, people feel how hopeless it all is&#148;.</p>
+</ul>
+<p><a name="07030533000021"></a>It is not all hopeless, but it is part of the same point. The EU has got itself into a bit of a bind, because I do not see how it could possibly relax its auditing procedures now.</p>

That seems a sensible proposal, but it could be taken as something of a weakening of the strict rules the EU has set itself.</p>

Her case for wrongful dismissal is dragging interminably through the Luxembourg court and she, for all these pains, is unable to find another job. No one wants to irritate the corrupt and powerful beast in Brussels, do they? In voicing this support for Mrs Andreasen, perhaps I may also ask the chairman of the sub-committee, the noble Lord, Lord Radice, why her supplementary memorandum, submitted in correction of the misleading and damaging evidence given by the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, was not printed with the report? If it is true that a Clerk lost her e-mail, sent in before the end of July and after the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, on 25 July, why could it not have been included with the evidence instead of being referred to in a footnote on page 113? If the footnote could be printed, why not the memo? Why was it made available only in hard copy upon application to the Clerk? Why was it not even available on e-mail? I shall put a copy of the memorandum in question in the Library of the House and will assume, unless I am contradicted, that anyone who wants a copy can get one electronically from cookaj@parliament.uk&#151;who, incidentally, is not the Clerk who lost the original. This is a very important document. Not only does it put Mrs Andreasen&#146;s side of the case made so improperly against her; but, in

If I may, I shall also give a copy to the Minister after the debate.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07030531000024"></a>And so to the malodorous meat of the report itself. As I am not a chartered accountant, I have been guided in what I am about to say by some eminent practitioners in the field, principally Mr Andrew Hamilton FCA, who heads up his own successful practice in Edinburgh, and Mr Hugh Williams FCA, who has also published widely and is a senior partner of an award-winning firm in Plymouth. They have advised me to concentrate in the time available on one particular accounting matter in order to demonstrate the seriousness of the situation in Brussels and thus the inadequacy of the committee&#146;s report. So I will pass in unaccustomed and frustrated silence over the lack of respect for standard accounting principles such as double-entry bookkeeping and accrual accounting; the lack of security in the accounting system; poor internal controls with no one taking responsibility for sound financial management, with the chief accounting officer not even signing off the accounts; failings with the budgets; risks with advance payments; and the whole system wide open to fraud. No, I will resist all that and concentrate instead on the small matter of what has happened to &#8364;28 billion.</p>

-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para1"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07030531000025"></a>I am indebted to Mr Hamilton for raising this interesting question after he manfully struggled through the 139 pages of the Commission&#146;s annual accounts for 2005 together with the accompanying 228 pages of the Court of Auditors&#146; negative report. The experience made him an immediate and avid devotee of Marta Andreasen, of course, and his discoveries brought him to the attention of that great Euro-sceptic luminary, Mr Christopher Booker of the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I>. On 28 January this year Mr Booker duly wrote in his column about Mr Hamilton&#146;s analysis:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="07030531000037"></a>&#147;Although the Commission&#146;s operating revenue for 2005 was given, with implausible precision, as &#8364;107,890,098,965.56, it was impossible to discover where most of this money had come from or gone to, because the accounts do not use the double-entry system used by every corner shop. They are just a maze of meaningless figures. For instance, a figure for the EU&#146;s &#145;long-term and short-term pre-financing&#146; suddenly goes up from zero to &#8364;28 billion without explanation&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="07030531000034"></a>This version of events was too much for Mr Brian Gray, the successor to Mrs Andreasen and the Commission&#146;s present chief accounting officer. Incidentally, he moved up from being the head of the Commission&#146;s two biggest spending departments, agriculture and regional aid. Mr Gray fired back a letter to the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> on 4 February thus:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="07030531000038"></a>&#147;Long and short term pre-financing have not &#145;shot up&#146; from zero to &#8364;28 billion. Since 2005 the EU&#146;s balance sheet has had a different format to take account of the move from cash-based to accrual-based accounting standards, in line with the way British authorities now record their own financial situation&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="07030531000035"></a>Mr Hamilton, Mr Williams and their accounting fraternity generally just could not believe this. Together with 12 other high-powered accountants and lawyers, they replied to Mr Gray as follows in the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> of 11 February:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="07030531000039"></a>&#147;As experienced chartered accountants and lawyers, we are amazed by the letter from Mr Brian Gray, the European Commission&#146;s chief accountant, defending the EU&#146;s accounting system. On

What does he not understand about the 2005 Court of Auditors&#146; 228-page audit report which explains in minute detail all the errors, mistakes and irregularities of which the Commission are guilty?</p>
-</ul><ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="07030531000040"></a>&#147;On the matter of the &#8364;28 billion omitted from the 2004 accounts, Mr Gray attributes this to a change of accounting policy (from cash to accruals). Begging his pardon, but he is either incompetent or disingenuous. The &#8364;28 billion pre-financing sum should have been recorded as a &#8364;28 billion asset in the 2004 Commission accounts regardless of which accounting system was in operation. The very fact that it was not recorded as a cash-related asset in the 2004 accounts gives the lie to Mr Gray&#146;s claim that, &#145;The EU&#146;s general accounts have always been double-entry&#146;. Small wonder that the Court of Auditors continues to have no faith in the EC accounts&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="07030531000036"></a>As I said, this was signed by 14 eminent chartered accountants and lawyers, and we have heard nothing more from Mr Gray.</p>

-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para2"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07030531000026"></a>The questions my accountant friends would like me to put through the Government to the Commission are these. The UK sends many billions of pounds every year to Brussels, so I would have thought that the Government are entitled to some form of answer, particularly when the Commission&#146;s 2004 balance sheet has been understated by some 25 per cent. It has nothing to do with a change in accounting policy, but is just a typical example of the EU&#146;s complete disregard for financial probity.</p>
-
-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para3"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07030531000027"></a>The first question is this. Why was the &#8364;28 billion pre-financing figure not recorded as an asset in the Commission&#146;s 2004 accounts? After all, it was cash. Secondly, in the absence of a double-entry system to record pre-financing charges, how do we know that the figure is &#8364;28 billion and not, shall we say, 28 cents? Thirdly, is it true that the pre-financing figures are collected by means of a spreadsheet for completion by the member states themselves, and if so, who checks the figures? Fourthly, are these figures reconciled by the Commission to their own accounting records, and if not, why not? Fifthly, why has Mr Brian Gray, the Commission&#146;s chief accountant, said publicly that the &#8364;28 billion pre-financing figure was excluded from the Commission&#146;s 2004 accounts because it was not cash? Surely if anyone should know that pre-financing charges are de facto cash, it should be the chief accountant.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07030531000028"></a>I am sorry to direct these questions to the Minister, who cannot be held responsible for this report, but he is a member of a Government who continue to support our subservience to Brussels through our membership of the European Union&#151;very expensive subservience, too.</p>

-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para5"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07030531000029"></a>I conclude with one suggestion for Her Majesty&#146;s Government. Surely it must by now be obvious that the Commission and other EU institutions are not going to do anything to sort out the ongoing accounting shambles and vulnerability to fraud. They have been promising to do so for a long time, but nothing has been done. I remember Mr Kenneth Clarke, when Chancellor of the Exchequer some 14 years ago, coming before your Lordships&#146; Select Committee, upon which I then sat, and assuring us that all these problems&#151;which were the same then as now&#151;would be sorted out by a

But, of course, they were not. The will simply is not there; it is all too comfortable.</p>
-
-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para6"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07030531000030"></a>We should also not forget that, despite the Eurocrats&#146; best attempts thorough multi-million euro propaganda campaigns in schools and across the continent of Europe, there is still no European demos, and there will not be for any time to come. Thus there can be no European democracy to hold the freeloaders to account, and so the system rolls on regardless. But people do not feel strongly enough to protest, and anyway they have no influence in appointing or dismissing the principal villains, who are the Commission.</p>
-
-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para7"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07030531000031"></a>My suggestion is simply that the Government should insist that one of the larger firms of international chartered accountants should be given the task of sorting the whole thing out. Of course the Commission would refuse such an idea, but if the Government got together with one or two other member states that were large donors to the EU and refused to send any more money until such a firm had been appointed, I fancy that would have the desired effect. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reaction to this idea.</p>

In contrast to the previous speaker I find the report scrupulous, detailed and important. As we know, the EU budget is only a tiny proportion of the GDP of member states, but when spent, as the report notes, it can amount to very large sums indeed.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07030533000002"></a>There are quite a lot of jokes about this topic, and it is probably not wise to tell a joke to such a small audience as this, but I will have a go anyway. Europhobes might actually like this joke, so maybe I could expect a laugh from the other side. There are these two wealthy businessmen, and they are talking about how they have made their fortunes from EU funds. One is from western Europe, and the other is from what used to be eastern Europe. The one from western Europe takes his friend to his country and says, &#147;You see that stretch of road? I got &#8364;10 million to fund that, and it only cost &#8364;5 million to build. You go figure the implications&#148;. Then the one from eastern Europe takes his friend to his country and says, &#147;You see that road?&#148;. The one from western Europe says, &#147;What road?&#148;&#151;because there is no road there. The guy from eastern Europe says, &#147;I got &#8364;10 million in EU funds to construct that road. You go figure the implications&#148;.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07030533000003"></a>Unlike the previous speaker, I have no quarrel with most of this report. I shall make five brief comments upon it. First, it is surely right to say that the current state of audit of the EU budget is a serious problem. It is regularly used, as we can see from the previous speech, by those who seek to bash the EU. The issues are well put in the Treasury&#146;s memorandum of evidence in the second volume of the report, where it says that the audit methodology is very precise and hence it tends to be used as a negative assessment&#151;in other words, as the memorandum says, the bar has been set

The memorandum also says something more qualified: the quality of financial management is consistently not good enough. We have to ask why that should be so.</p>
-
-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para10"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07030533000004"></a>Secondly, however, as the report correctly indicates and previous speakers have noted, the major difficulties happen at the level of member states, since most of the funds are allocated to, and spent by, them. I would see the issue here as a bit like that of the Lisbon agenda as it relates to the structural issue of the European Union. You have the European Commission, which is nominally the government of Europe, but a lot of what the Commission wants to do is determined by powers that remain in the hands of the member nations. I will come back to that in a minute.</p>
-
-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para11"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07030533000005"></a>Thirdly, I am not sure whether I should say this, but I only got my job as director of the LSE because the Comptroller and Auditor-General, Sir John Bourn, decided he did not want it. Maybe he did not want to face all the fractious academics you have to deal with. Anyway, it is interesting that, as was previously mentioned, he says that he could not have signed off our national accounts using this system&#151;again, surely an expression of the fact that the bar has been set very high. I find his comment interesting. He says:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07030533000027"></a>&#147;By setting a test which is so high, when you explain or put this out publicly, people feel how hopeless it all is&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="07030533000021"></a>It is not all hopeless, but it is part of the same point. The EU has got itself into a bit of a bind, because I do not see how it could possibly relax its auditing procedures now.</p>
-
-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para12"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07030533000006"></a>Fourthly, I fear that that latter point might apply to the suggestion in the report that the audit of revenue and expenditure be separated from the statement of assurance. That seems a sensible proposal, but it could be taken as something of a weakening of the strict rules the EU has set itself.</p>
-
-<a name="70305-0012.htm_para13"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07030533000007"></a>Fifthly, since many of the problems are concentrated at member-state level, it is surely right to place a great deal of emphasis on tightening up at that level. Again, maybe the way forward is a bit like the Lisbon agenda. As we know, the agenda has not worked too well, partly because the Commission does not have the capability of fully controlling the policies that member nations institute. In recent publications about the Lisbon agenda, countries&#151;and the European Union as a whole&#151;are much closer now to meeting the agenda's objectives than seemed possible two or three years ago. That is because member states have taken the initiative into their own hands and some have served as active models for others. That is also the way forward for this issue.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07030533000008"></a>The report mentions that the Dutch Government are producing their own statement of assurance. Since the report was written, the Netherlands has been joined by Sweden and Denmark, who will do the same thing&#151;that was announced recently on 27 February. It makes sense for the Dutch to pilot a scheme that others could follow in conjunction with other member states. Like the Lisbon agenda, this might be more successful as a bottom-up rather than a top-down exercise.</p>

 <p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07030544000017"></a>The report was replete with Mrs Andreasen&#146;s oral evidence; there was plenty of it. I did not find it at all convincing. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, that it is difficult to measure fraud precisely. Although it was wholly a national problem for us, we can think of the vast amounts of money involved in the recent carousel fraud scandal related to UK VAT. The Treasury says that that has now been solved, but I doubt that it has been completely solved. I should think that there is still a considerable amount of it going on. The idea that there is one source of fraudulent activity called the EU Commission in Brussels and that fraud does not go on anywhere else, or in the private sector at all, is complete rubbish, as the two UKIP Peers must admit.</p>

I well recall that Enron was certified and supported as giving accurate accounts by two famous international firms. Look what happened to it. There are many such examples. It is ridiculous to say that there is magical veracity and accuracy in the private sector and a problem in the European Commission because it is in the public sector.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07030544000020"></a>That is the great beauty of the Union: we can all learn from each other and pool the best from all in methods and practice. Accruals-based accounting has made a big difference, as the Government acknowledge. When talking to people outside, I find that the IFAC rules inspire greater confidence everywhere. The committee reminded us that administrative mistakes are just as important as the often-overstated cases of actual naked fraud. However, we must admit that both give the Community a bad name. Even if that is somewhat unfair, it has to be tackled and improved in future.</p>

-<p><a name="07030544000070"></a>I notice the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, nodding in agreement with that proposition. If we can get to that position as a routine matter of regular, repeated behaviour, then great strides will be made. Although that would virtuously go beyond what national budget Ministers are prepared to do normally in their own national context in most member states, it would help to inspire confidence in a system where putting together 27 different national accounting and verification procedures is a nightmare at any time. But it must be achieved.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07030544000023"></a>I offer my congratulations to the committee on its application and hard work in investigating this subject. Reading through the evidence I can only admire the committee's tact and patience. So much of the evidence from witnesses who appear reliable, honest and sensible is contradicted by other witnesses who also seem reliable, honest and sensible. For example, we have Mr Brian Gray, accounting officer for the European Commission, who, when asked whether double-entry bookkeeping of the conventional kind does or does not exist, stated that,</p>
-<ul><a name="07030544000079"></a>&#147;the idea of having single entry accounts is risible. We have never had single entry accounts&#148;.</ul>
-<p><a name="07030544000071"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, also said that the European Commission has always used double-entry accounting. On the other hand, Mr Jules Muis, former head of internal audit for the Commission, said:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="07030544000075"></a>&#147;The system of the Commission, by my definition was not double entry bookkeeping&#148;.</p>
-</ul>
-<p><a name="07030544000072"></a>Marta Andreasen, who we have heard about so much this evening, gave evidence that double-entry book-keeping was not adhered to.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07030544000024"></a>Mr Terry Wynn MEP commented that the European Court of Auditors has concluded, every year since 1994, that the accounts are reliable. The qualified statement of assurance concerns mainly the underlying transactions. From that he comes to his conclusion that it is not correct that the accounts have not been given a positive statement of assurance; the failure is the underlying transactions&#151;a number of your Lordships have commented on that this evening. This comment by Mr Wynn is difficult to reconcile with the statement by Siim Kallas, European Commissioner for Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-fraud, who in his evidence stated:</p>
-<ul>
-<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="07030544000076"></a>&#147;The Court effectively gave reasonable assurance on about one third of payments&#148;.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07030544000025"></a>The European Court of Auditors commented that errors were identified in accounts payable by 508 million euros and in pre-financing by 822 million euros. Mr Ashley Mote MEP stated that the Court of Auditors admits that 80 per cent of all taxpayers&#146; money is never properly accounted for. Mrs Andreasen&#146;s evidence was that 90 to 95 per cent of the annual budget was refused clearance. Again, Mr Gray describes the accounting systems as rock solid. Both Mr Muis and Marta Andreasen argue that the systems are inadequate and &#147;fragile&#148;; they are supported in this by Mr Mote. The Commission's July 2006 report supports Mr Muis&#146;s opinion.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07030544000026"></a>Other examples of conflicting statements are over the mechanics of payment authorisations, whether the debts up to &#8364;1 million euros can be waived, whether the 416 imprest accounts are audited, on annual cash surplus, and so on. But I will spare your Lordships the full list and from going through all the detail.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07030544000027"></a>What comes clearly from all this is that there are two distinct views on the accounts and the reporting of financial matters in the European Union. There are those who believe that there have been minor and relatively unimportant errors in the past, with only minimal corruption, and that the road map will be sufficient to sort this out. Then there are those who say that the systems are fundamentally flawed and that there is a culture of corruption and incompetence. Whom are we to believe? What is certain is that there is a strong basis for concern. Accounts have not been passed for 12 years. We are talking not about an isolated incident but about a steady and consistent failure. Difficult though it may be, one would have thought that, once in every 12 years, the accounts would not have been qualified.</p>

-<a name="70305-0014.htm_para16"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07030544000028"></a>There was the Santer scandal in 1999 when the Commission, headed by Jacques Santer, resigned amid allegations of fraud, nepotism and mismanagement. There was the Eurostat scandal, when millions of euros were paid to private companies owned by Commission officials&#151;errors which, according to Marta Andreasen, occurred in the 15 per cent of the budget that is under the direct control of the Commission as opposed to under the control of member states. Accounting faults in member states should not obscure the fact that there are similar questions over accounts produced by the Commission.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07030544000029"></a>There is the issue of whistleblowers. I do not believe that someone like Marta Andreasen would sacrifice her career without deeply held and sincere beliefs. The committee has come up with some valuable recommendations, among which is the requirement for the reverse cascade of signing off accounts, the requirement that Commission officials and existing audit bodies take responsibility for the systems and accounts, and the simplification of rules and regulations. None of your Lordships has mentioned this tonight, but it is a fundamental problem with the whole situation. I would have liked the committee to recommend strengthening the protection for whistleblowers. In England, there is a requirement for listed companies&#151;those quoted on the Stock Exchange&#151;to have a mechanism in place whereby anyone reporting misdemeanours by officers of the company, however lowly or senior the officer or whistleblower&#146;s position might be, can do so without any fear of repercussions to the whistleblower.</p>

-<a name="70305-0014.htm_para18"></a>
-<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07030544000030"></a>However, all these and the other recommendations are based on the assumption that there is a real and genuine desire for a more rigorous system of reviewing and checking accounts. There may well be such a wish but, given the mass of conflicting evidence, there may well not be. I do not know the answer, but there is a lot of smoke, so there might well be a fire. The Commission owes it to itself to address openly and transparently the claims that have been made. Perhaps it could do so through the use of outside agencies, as the noble Lords, Lord Pearson and Lord Willoughby de Broke, have suggested. If it does not, serious doubts will remain about its integrity. Unless such action is taken, claims that a culture of corruption exists will be believed. Evidence has been given that, on the whole, mistakes are irregularities and not fraud. The committee has accepted this, but how does anyone know? The money has gone but, frequently lacking a proper audit trail, no one knows where it is. It is impossible to say what is fraud and what is irregularity, as the noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Willoughby de Broke, pointed out. If the integrity of the Commission is not vigorously established the assumption will increasingly be made that it is fraud.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07030544000031"></a>It might seem a little harsh when the committee has produced such an excellent report to introduce anything but praise, but two points are worth noting. It is a pity that such prominence is given in the report, and by the noble Lord, Lord Radice, to the statement by Sir John Bourn that he would not be able to give a clean bill of health to the United Kingdom's accounts, because 13, or 2.5 per cent, of the 500 accounts he examined are qualified. The United Kingdom's situation is not comparable to the European Union situation where somewhere between 66 per cent, if you extrapolate that figure from Commissioner Kallas&#146;s evidence, and 90 per cent, if you look at the European Court of Auditors&#146; reports, have to be qualified. Of more relevance is his comment that it is very likely that listed companies&#151;those quoted on the Stock Exchange&#151;must,</p>
-<ul><a name="07030544000080"></a>&#147;be audited by International Auditing Standards&#148;.</ul>
-<p><a name="07030544000073"></a>He went on to note that it is odd that standards for the private sector are not seen as appropriate for the public sector.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07030544000032"></a>The second regret is that the committee was unable to clarify the discrepancy between conflicting evidence presented to it. I am thinking in particular of the answer to the evidence from the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, by Marta Andreasen which could not be included in the evidence accompanying the report. I had thought that this was because it arrived late or for some other good reason, although the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has raised doubts about that. Mrs Andreasen&#146;s supplementary evidence contradicts the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07030544000033"></a>Two simple examples have already been commented on by the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke; namely, Mrs Andreasen&#146;s employment by the OECD and her rate of pay and ranking. These two examples are facts, which could easily have been verified, thereby adding or not to the credibility of witnesses. I urge the Minister to vigorously pursue the introduction of proper accounting systems; the enhancement of the protection of whistleblowers; the assuming of full responsibility for accounts by member states, which can be done without any surrender of sovereignty or interference from the Commission, and by the directors-general; and the improvement and proper independence and rigour of internal auditing. Whether Euro-phile or Euro-sceptic, all would agree that an institution of the size and importance of the European Union must be seen to be above reproach.</p>

When I chided the noble Lord, Lord Howard, on his contribution to the Olympic Games debate, it was less about what he had to say about the costs than the fact that the debate was about the legacy of the Games yet he concentrated solely on costs. I thought that I made a fair criticism. This evening I have no criticism of the relevance of his remarks because he has addressed the central issues. I shall disagree with some of his conclusions, but he will expect me to do that.</p>

But that is last week&#146;s debate and this is this week&#146;s. I am very grateful for the opportunity to respond to this important debate. As my honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury made clear at the time, the Government very much congratulate the committee on the cogency of its analysis and particularly the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Radice in producing this thorough, timely and persuasive work.</p>

We agree with the vast majority of the recommendations made in the report, and we have produced our own initiative to show how member states can better manage EU funds. I heard from the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, when intervening on the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, about one individual who wrote to a newspaper indicating that this initiative has not been universally welcomed, but would any initiative on Europe gain universal welcome in the nation? It certainly would not be welcomed by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, but it has been welcomed by a wide range of people. Further, other Governments are looking at the British initiative and setting out to follow aspects of it. My noble friend Lord Giddens identified how member states are following our approach.</p>

Before I attempt to respond to all noble Lords, I want to put the issue into context. The background to the committee&#146;s report is depressing. For the 12th year running the European Court of Auditors has again been unable to give a positive statement of assurance on the EU budget. That is a statement whose truth all of us regret. Although the court was, with some minor reservations, able to confirm the reliability of the accounts, the proportion of spending that was qualified&#151;around two thirds&#151;was essentially the same as in the previous year. That is deeply disappointing and is why we are insistent that improvements should be made. The administrative reform measures were pioneered by my noble friend Lord Kinnock, who in his absence has had rather a tough time in this debate. Would that he were here to respond to certain remarks tonight. However, nearly all the onslaught on my noble friend had nothing to do with his constructive approach to the European position, but concentrated solely on an individual case. I shall not speak from the Dispatch Box about an individual case, but I shall agree with all those&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Pearson and Lord Howard, were prominent in making the case&#151;who have said that we need to respect whistleblowers. We want to see that the European Community recognises the value of whistleblowers and their necessary protection. My noble friend Lord Kinnock recommended that, and we as a Government support it.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07030544000040"></a>It is unfair to be too critical of the fact that some of these reforms have not yet bedded down and it is too early to pronounce a verdict. However, it is clear that a great deal more needs to be done to improve EU financial management if we are to achieve the positive statement of assurance that our taxpayers deserve. I certainly agree with all those&#151;even with noble Lords who pledge allegiance to UKIP&#151;who say that our taxpayers deserve an assurance that the EU accounts can stand the test of proper auditing. It is unacceptable that EU spending is qualified in this way year after year, and the British Government are taking a lead to make sure that the situation improves.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07030544000041"></a>European spending is often accompanied in this country by somewhat hysterical accounts in the press of the degree of fraud and corruption. I would be the last to suggest that any contributor to the debate tonight deserves those epithets, but suffice it to say that almost every transgression referred to this evening with regard to the accounts has been alleged fraud. For example, the late submission of documents, missing the date&#151;clearly an irregularity&#151;was defined by certain noble Lords as irregularity shading inevitably into fraud, and the case is proven against the European Commission.</p>

I well recall that Enron was certified and supported as giving accurate accounts by two famous international firms. Look what happened to it. There are many such examples. It is ridiculous to say that there is magical veracity and accuracy in the private sector and a problem in the European Commission because it is in the public sector.</p>

Accruals-based accounting has made a big difference, as the Government acknowledge. When talking to people outside, I find that the IFAC rules inspire greater confidence everywhere. The committee reminded us that administrative mistakes are just as important as the often-overstated cases of actual naked fraud. However, we must admit that both give the Community a bad name. Even if that is somewhat unfair, it has to be tackled and improved in future.</p>

If we can get to that position as a routine matter of regular, repeated behaviour, then great strides will be made. Although that would virtuously go beyond what national budget Ministers are prepared to do normally in their own national context in most member states, it would help to inspire confidence in a system where putting together 27 different national accounting and verification procedures is a nightmare at any time. But it must be achieved.</p>

Reading through the evidence I can only admire the committee's tact and patience. So much of the evidence from witnesses who appear reliable, honest and sensible is contradicted by other witnesses who also seem reliable, honest and sensible. For example, we have Mr Brian Gray, accounting officer for the European Commission, who, when asked whether double-entry bookkeeping of the conventional kind does or does not exist, stated that,</p>

+<p><a name="07030544000071"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, also said that the European Commission has always used double-entry accounting. On the other hand, Mr Jules Muis, former head of internal audit for the Commission, said:</p>

+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="07030544000075"></a>&#147;The system of the Commission, by my definition was not double entry bookkeeping&#148;.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07030544000024"></a>Mr Terry Wynn MEP commented that the European Court of Auditors has concluded, every year since 1994, that the accounts are reliable. The qualified statement of assurance concerns mainly the underlying transactions. From that he comes to his conclusion that it is not correct that the accounts have not been given a positive statement of assurance; the failure is the underlying transactions&#151;a number of your Lordships have commented on that this evening. This comment by Mr Wynn is difficult to reconcile with the statement by Siim Kallas, European Commissioner for Administrative Affairs, Audit and Anti-fraud, who in his evidence stated:</p>
+<ul>
+<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="07030544000076"></a>&#147;The Court effectively gave reasonable assurance on about one third of payments&#148;.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07030544000025"></a>The European Court of Auditors commented that errors were identified in accounts payable by 508 million euros and in pre-financing by 822 million euros. Mr Ashley Mote MEP stated that the Court of Auditors admits that 80 per cent of all taxpayers&#146; money is never properly accounted for. Mrs Andreasen&#146;s evidence was that 90 to 95 per cent of the annual budget was refused clearance. Again, Mr Gray describes the accounting systems as rock solid. Both Mr Muis and Marta Andreasen argue that the systems are inadequate and &#147;fragile&#148;; they are supported in this by Mr Mote. The Commission's July 2006 report supports Mr Muis&#146;s opinion.</p>

There are those who believe that there have been minor and relatively unimportant errors in the past, with only minimal corruption, and that the road map will be sufficient to sort this out. Then there are those who say that the systems are fundamentally flawed and that there is a culture of corruption and incompetence. Whom are we to believe? What is certain is that there is a strong basis for concern. Accounts have not been passed for 12 years. We are talking not about an isolated incident but about a steady and consistent failure. Difficult though it may be, one would have thought that, once in every 12 years, the accounts would not have been qualified.</p>

Accounting faults in member states should not obscure the fact that there are similar questions over accounts produced by the Commission.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07030544000029"></a>There is the issue of whistleblowers. I do not believe that someone like Marta Andreasen would sacrifice her career without deeply held and sincere beliefs. The committee has come up with some valuable recommendations, among which is the requirement for the reverse cascade of signing off accounts, the requirement that Commission officials and existing audit bodies take responsibility for the systems and accounts, and the simplification of rules and regulations. None of your Lordships has mentioned this tonight, but it is a fundamental problem with the whole situation. I would have liked the committee to recommend strengthening the protection for whistleblowers. In England, there is a requirement for listed companies&#151;those quoted on the Stock Exchange&#151;to have a mechanism in place whereby anyone reporting misdemeanours by officers of the company, however lowly or senior the officer or whistleblower&#146;s position might be, can do so without any fear of repercussions to the whistleblower.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07030544000030"></a>However, all these and the other recommendations are based on the assumption that there is a real and genuine desire for a more rigorous system of reviewing and checking accounts. There may well be such a wish but, given the mass of conflicting evidence, there may well not be. I do not know the answer, but there is a lot of smoke, so there might well be a fire. The Commission owes it to itself to address openly and transparently the claims that have been made. Perhaps it could do so through the use of outside agencies, as the noble Lords, Lord Pearson and Lord Willoughby de Broke, have suggested. If it does not, serious doubts will remain about its integrity. Unless such action is taken, claims that a culture of corruption exists will be believed. Evidence has been given that, on the whole, mistakes are irregularities and not fraud. The committee has accepted this, but how does anyone know? The money has gone but, frequently lacking a proper audit trail, no one knows where it is. It is impossible to say what is fraud and what is irregularity, as the noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Willoughby de Broke, pointed out. If the integrity of the Commission is not vigorously established the assumption will increasingly be made that it is fraud.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07030544000031"></a>It might seem a little harsh when the committee has produced such an excellent report to introduce anything but praise, but two points are worth noting. It is a pity that such prominence is given in the report, and by the noble Lord, Lord Radice, to the statement by Sir John Bourn that he would not be able to give a clean bill of health to the United Kingdom's accounts, because 13, or 2.5 per cent, of the 500 accounts he examined are qualified. The United Kingdom's situation is not comparable to the European Union situation where somewhere between 66 per cent, if you extrapolate that figure from Commissioner Kallas&#146;s evidence, and 90 per cent, if you look at the European Court of Auditors&#146; reports, have to be qualified. Of more relevance is his comment that it is very likely that listed companies&#151;those quoted on the Stock Exchange&#151;must,</p>
+<ul><a name="07030544000080"></a>&#147;be audited by International Auditing Standards&#148;.</ul>
+<p><a name="07030544000073"></a>He went on to note that it is odd that standards for the private sector are not seen as appropriate for the public sector.</p>

I am thinking in particular of the answer to the evidence from the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, by Marta Andreasen which could not be included in the evidence accompanying the report. I had thought that this was because it arrived late or for some other good reason, although the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has raised doubts about that. Mrs Andreasen&#146;s supplementary evidence contradicts the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07030544000033"></a>Two simple examples have already been commented on by the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke; namely, Mrs Andreasen&#146;s employment by the OECD and her rate of pay and ranking. These two examples are facts, which could easily have been verified, thereby adding or not to the credibility of witnesses. I urge the Minister to vigorously pursue the introduction of proper accounting systems; the enhancement of the protection of whistleblowers; the assuming of full responsibility for accounts by member states, which can be done without any surrender of sovereignty or interference from the Commission, and by the directors-general; and the improvement and proper independence and rigour of internal auditing. Whether Euro-phile or Euro-sceptic, all would agree that an institution of the size and importance of the European Union must be seen to be above reproach.</p>

When I chided the noble Lord, Lord Howard, on his contribution to the Olympic Games debate, it was less about what he had to say about the costs than the fact that the debate was about the legacy of the Games yet he concentrated solely on costs. I thought that I made a fair criticism. This evening I have no criticism of the relevance of his remarks because he has addressed the central issues. I shall disagree with some of his conclusions, but he will expect me to do that.</p>

But that is last week&#146;s debate and this is this week&#146;s. I am very grateful for the opportunity to respond to this important debate.

We agree with the vast majority of the recommendations made in the report, and we have produced our own initiative to show how member states can better manage EU funds. I heard from the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, when intervening on the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, about one individual who wrote to a newspaper indicating that this initiative has not been universally welcomed, but would any initiative on Europe gain universal welcome in the nation? It certainly would not be welcomed by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, but it has been welcomed by a wide range of people. Further, other Governments are looking at the British initiative and setting out to follow aspects of it. My noble friend Lord Giddens identified how member states are following our approach.</p>

+<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07030544000039"></a>Although we have until 10 pm, I do not intend to take that length of time, but I hope to be able to respond to the questions put to me. Before I attempt to respond to all noble Lords, I want to put the issue into context. The background to the committee&#146;s report is depressing. For the 12th year running the European Court of Auditors has again been unable to give a positive statement of assurance on the EU budget. That is a statement whose truth all of us regret. Although the court was, with some minor reservations, able to confirm the reliability of the accounts, the proportion of spending that was qualified&#151;around two thirds&#151;was essentially the same as in the previous year. That is deeply disappointing and is why we are insistent that improvements should be made. The administrative reform measures were pioneered by my noble friend Lord Kinnock, who in his absence has had rather a tough time in this debate. Would that he were here to respond to certain remarks tonight. However, nearly all the onslaught on my noble friend had nothing to do with his constructive approach to the European position, but concentrated solely on an individual case. I shall not speak from the Dispatch Box about an individual case, but I shall agree with all those&#151;the noble Lords, Lord Pearson and Lord Howard, were prominent in making the case&#151;who have said that we need to respect whistleblowers. We want to see that the European Community recognises the value of whistleblowers and their necessary protection. My noble friend Lord Kinnock recommended that, and we as a Government support it.</p>

However, it is clear that a great deal more needs to be done to improve EU financial management if we are to achieve the positive statement of assurance that our taxpayers deserve. I certainly agree with all those&#151;even with noble Lords who pledge allegiance to UKIP&#151;who say that our taxpayers deserve an assurance that the EU accounts can stand the test of proper auditing. It is unacceptable that EU spending is qualified in this way year after year, and the British Government are taking a lead to make sure that the situation improves.</p>

I would be the last to suggest that any contributor to the debate tonight deserves those epithets, but suffice it to say that almost every transgression referred to this evening with regard to the accounts has been alleged fraud. For example, the late submission of documents, missing the date&#151;clearly an irregularity&#151;was defined by certain noble Lords as irregularity shading inevitably into fraud, and the case is proven against the European Commission.</p>
