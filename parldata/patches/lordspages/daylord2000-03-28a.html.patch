In relation to the term "day centre", my amendment ensures that the general social care council will regulate establishments that provide nursing or personal care on a non-residential basis, wholly or mainly for persons who are or have been ill, are disabled or infirm, or who are or have been dependent on alcohol or drugs. I hope that is helpful to the House.

 <A NAME = "00328-06_para1"></a>So far as concerns the question of when the review will take place and how long afterwards would any necessary action be taken, I am not in a position to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on that matter. But the fact that we have set a date for the review to be undertaken one year after the establishment of the commission is a sign of our commitment to wanting that to happen. We share the views of noble Lords about the importance of this matter.

 <A NAME = "00328-34_para5"></a>In the first of those incarnations, I was rather intolerant of any bad practice. But in the second, I used every adversarial and advocacy skill to get my member off or to mitigate the effect of any penalty. But, after a successful case, I would sometimes go home in the evening and wonder what on earth I had done. However, like, I am sure, every lawyer representing someone before the courts, I would rationalise my position by saying that I had a job to do and it was for the other side to prove its case.
