-<A NAME="00328-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunts of Kings Heath: </B>  My Lords, I listened with great interest to the noble Lord, Lord Renton. In relation to the term "day centre", my amendment ensures that the general social care council will regulate establishments that provide nursing or personal care on a non-residential basis, wholly or mainly for persons who are or have been ill, are disabled or infirm, or who are or have been dependent on alcohol or drugs. I hope that is helpful to the House.

 <A NAME = "00328-06_para1"></a>So far as concerns the question of when the review will take place and how long afterwards would any necessary action be taken, I am not in a position to respond to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on that matter. But the fact that we have set a date for the review to be undertaken one year after the establishment of the commission is a sign of our commitment to wanting that to happen. We share the views of noble Lords about the importance of this matter.

-<A NAME="00328-34_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Mackenzie of Culkein: </B>  My Lords, I hesitate to keep the discussion going at this late hour but I feel strongly about this matter. I want to say something about this from two perspectives: first, from the perspective of my younger years as a nurse with responsibility for managing other nurses and for aspects of healthcare delivery; and, secondly, at a second stage in my life, from the perspective of a healthcare trade union officer representing members before disciplinary and appeals tribunals of health authorities or disciplinary committees of the nursing and midwifery statutory bodies.

 <A NAME = "00328-34_para5"></a>In the first of those incarnations, I was rather intolerant of any bad practice. But in the second, I used every adversarial and advocacy skill to get my member off or to mitigate the effect of any penalty. But, after a successful case, I would sometimes go home in the evening and wonder what on earth I had done. However, like, I am sure, every lawyer representing someone before the courts, I would rationalise my position by saying that I had a job to do and it was for the other side to prove its case.
