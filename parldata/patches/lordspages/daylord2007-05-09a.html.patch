 <p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="070509115000015"></a>When plan A was touch and go, we were discussing plan B; that Northern Ireland business in this House would no longer be dealt briefly. With regard to reserve powers, I hope that the Government will stick to that commitment and that we will not have Northern Ireland legislation or reserve powers by way of Order in Council. We should be able to devise a system. The reserve powers will be important; they are not trivial. We must have a mechanism in this House for properly considering them. Other than that, it is a great day for Northern Ireland and we must wish it well.</p>

I do not disagree with anything that has been said but it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail. Clearly, we want decommissioning. There is no role for paramilitaries. There is no means of taking society forward and bringing about a normal civil society other than through the rule of law and allegiance to democracy. That applies to all paramilitaries who retain their weapons and are outside the agreements. Work will continue to attempt to bring about full decommissioning.</p>
