 <p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="090609116000006"></a>I therefore ask the Minister&#151;this might be something that we will need to come back to in more detail on Third Reading&#151;whether he can give an undertaking that this will not extend the time limit or add extra time and cost burdens for the London boroughs acting as billing authorities. I was told this morning that London Councils has been in touch with the Scottish and London BIDs, which have told him that it is not straightforward to consult owners. I have said ever since I introduced the original Private Member&#146;s Bill that I think that it is right that there should be an option to bring in owners. However, I have been told by those who will have to operate this scheme&#151;namely the billing authorities&#151;that this is not wholly straightforward. Suddenly to be confronted, as they were late last week, with this substantial, six-page government amendment, in order to achieve this one little change adding owners to occupiers for the purposes of a BID, makes them feel very hard done by. The Minister needs to recognise that.</p>
