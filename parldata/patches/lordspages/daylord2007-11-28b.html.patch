 <p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07112874000075"></a>In summary, the Bill claims fine intentions. It follows our long call to reduce the burden of enforcement and to acquire consistency in regulation. But I fear that it may in practice achieve the very opposite of its claimed aims&#151;transparency, accountability, proportionality and consistency&#151;and instead produce confusion. It could also, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, and others have said, mean more bureaucracy and, as my noble Lord Hodgson said, cost. I can but hope that sensible amendments make it workable.</p>

I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I intend to summarise the contents of the past few hours and if I miss a point or a question that was asked of me, I ask noble Lords to write, and I will come back.</p>
