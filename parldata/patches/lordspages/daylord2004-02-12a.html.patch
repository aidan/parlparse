 <a name="40212-09_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor does not have the right to abolish a 1,000 year-old office. How dare he abolish the office held by Becket, More and Lord Halsbury and that all the Hailshams seem to have held. It is a sad day for the understanding of a liberal democracy, for the rule of law and the high court of Parliament.

They do not believe that it is appropriate. Secondly, so no hare starts running, will he accept my assurance that I have not spoken to any Law Lord about my contribution to this debate?

 <A NAME="40212w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   I am sorry for the delay in replying to Lord Christopher's question. Much of the detailed information requested by Lord Christopher was not held centrally within the Cabinet Office and officials had to consult the Ministry of Defence. The Christmas recess also intervened. The process therefore took much longer than is desirable and for this I apologise. Cabinet Office staff draft Answers to Parliamentary Questions as part of their normal day-to-day duties. There are no Cabinet Office staff solely employed on drafting Answers to Parliamentary Questions.
