 <a name="20618w02_para0"></a>The officials met the detainees individually. US officials were able to observe the interviews. One detainee had sustained injuries in Afghanistan. He and the US authorities confirmed that he was receiving medical treatment for them. The other detainees appeared to be in satisfactory physical health, though some of them complained of ailments which are being addressed. Some detainees raised concerns about their status and other aspects of their detention and conditions at Guantanamo which British officials discussed with the camp authorities. The officials saw no visible sign of mistreatment.
