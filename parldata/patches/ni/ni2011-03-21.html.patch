 <p class="B3BodyText">This amendment is designed to add to the protections that  are built in to the Bill. I appreciate that the new system will provide for what  is called front-loading the system, which is designed to make sure that all the  various objections or concerns may be addressed and hopefully resolved at an  early stage. I do not accept that adding the third-party right to appeal will  automatically snarl up the planning system. I believe and hope that we will  find in due course that the front-loading of the system will mean that many of  the issues that would have been outstanding in the minds of the people who  would have cause to object will instead be resolved. I believe that if the  front-loaded system works, there would be less cause for objection or people  seeking a right to appeal at the latter end of the process.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, we commend the Bill. However, I have been a  representative in South Belfast for a number of years now, and, in my  experience, I have found that many people felt that quite a number of decisions  that the planners took were completely unjustifiable. In fact, a number of  those examples have been raised in this Chamber, certainly with all the  previous Environment Ministers.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is a belt-and-braces exercise. It will ensure  that, along with the front-loading of the planning system, we, ultimately,  provide the opportunity for people to raise concerns if they feel the need to,  provided that they have already been involved in the objections process earlier  in the system and any other limitations that the Department may feel  appropriate to add in. As I said, this is merely a belt-and-braces exercise  that would enable the Planning Appeals Commission to give the right of appeal  if concerns still need to be addressed. However, it would neither guarantee nor  ensure that that happens.</p>

 <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues have been raised today in debating the  amendments. Clause 53 provides for used mineral sites to be restored for  agricultural, forestry or amenity uses. Amendment No 1 would expand that to  ecological uses, and I am quite happy to accept it. The work of the Quarry  Products Association has been mentioned, and that is significant. I think that  amendment No 1 has the potential to further increase our biodiversity, and that  is something that would be good for Northern Ireland.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 proposes that the Department make  regulations that would allow us to introduce the third-party right of appeal. I  previously set out the Executive&rsquo;s position, which has not changed. I said that  further consideration of third-party appeals should be deferred until the  extensive changes to the planning system under planning and local government  reform have settled down and are working effectively. I listened to the  arguments then, and many were advanced in favour of third-party appeals during  the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage and, indeed, this afternoon, but I have not  heard anything that would persuade me to move from our position.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">It has been suggested that third-party appeals would  address fairness and create a level playing field, whereby objectors could  challenge the granting of permissions in the same way as a developer can appeal  refusals. However, the Bill&rsquo;s fundamental reforms are designed to include third  parties at every stage, particularly at the early stages. Statements of  community involvement will require councils to set out how they will involve  the public in their development plan and development management activities.  Likewise, developers will have to demonstrate effective public engagement via  pre-application community consultation before their planning applications can  be determined.</p>

However,  two of the amendments in this group are connected to amendments brought forward  by the Committee at Consideration Stage.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will refer to amendment No 3. Following its  scrutiny of the Bill, not only did the Committee recommend that penalties  should be increased for acts causing or likely to result in damage to listed  buildings, but called for an additional penalty of conviction on indictment to  an unlimited fine. That was to ensure that the protection of listed buildings  was seen to be a serious issue and that penalties could be reflective of damage  caused.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the House supported the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendations at Consideration Stage. The level of fine liable on summary  conviction was raised from level 3 to level 5, and the option of an unlimited  fine on conviction on indictment was added to the Bill. However, it appears  that when provision is made for two alternative penalties for an offence, it is  conventional for the upper limit of the fine liable on summary conviction to be  the statutory maximum. Amendment No 3 brings clause 103 into line with that  convention, but still reflects the Committee&rsquo;s wish for tougher penalties to  deter and punish wilful damage to listed buildings. On behalf of the Committee,  therefore, I welcome amendment No 3.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 9 amends the new clause that was introduced by  a Committee amendment at Consideration Stage. New clause 189 ensures that  councils would not be liable for compensation if they had to revoke a decision  made in the absence of a response from a statutory consultee if that consultee  had not responded by the required deadline. The Minister&rsquo;s amendment seeks to  include the Department, as well as councils, in that exemption from  compensation under those circumstances. That appears to be consistent with the  Committee&rsquo;s amendment, as we know that some planning applications will be  referred to the Department for decision, and it is feasible that it too could  end up liable for compensation if it made a decision that later had to be  revoked because of the late provision of information by a statutory consultee.  Amendment No 9 is therefore consistent with the Committee&rsquo;s position on that  aspect of the Bill, but in the absence of an opportunity to discuss the  amendment, it does not have an official position on it.</p>
