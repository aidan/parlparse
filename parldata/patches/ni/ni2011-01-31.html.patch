     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the Chairperson&rsquo;s  remarks, and Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose amendment Nos 1 to 8 from the Alliance  Party. However, I appreciate where Mr Farry is coming from with the amendments.  They were discussed at length in Committee. A number of Committee members  raised the issues he has spoken about, but the view of the Committee was that  we could not punish ordinary people and put them in an impossible position,  particularly people from rural areas.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Everybody felt strongly that an owner should have the right  to let their dog off on an intruder. Common sense has to prevail. That current  position has been in place for a considerable time &mdash; since 1983, to be exact &mdash;  whereby the occupier of a property commits no offence when they set their dog  on an intruder to remove them from their property. There cannot be the  possibility for ordinary people to be prosecuted for setting their dog to chase  off an intruder. That would not be acceptable to Sinn F&eacute;in. In Committee, the  Department gave great comfort to a number of members on those issues. At  Consideration Stage, it was Mr Farry&rsquo;s opinion that the issue was very generic  or loose. I appreciate where he is coming from, but it is my position that it  would be a legal minefield to open it up at this stage. As the Chairperson  said, we did not even have an opportunity as a Committee to have a discussion.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">At this late stage, I would not be happy to support the  amendments because, legally, it would put the onus on the dog owner who set a  dog on an intruder. It would put a great deal of strain on the ordinary person,  so I will not support amendment Nos 1 to 8, but I will support amendment Nos 9  and 10.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the motivation for tabling the amendments is  well intentioned, but I cannot support any of them. We need to be clear about  what the Bill says about dog attacks on trespassers. First, as Members have  heard, it does not substantively change the relevant provisions of the 1983  Dogs Order, which simply states that the occupier of a property commits no  offence when his or her dog attacks or is set on to remove a trespasser on  their property. The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development sought  reassurance on that point at Committee Stage. It was felt strongly that  legislation that allowed an owner to be prosecuted for setting his dog to chase  off a burglar would not be acceptable. My officials reassured the Committee on  that point and noted that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions on that issue simply restate  the position under the 1983 Dogs Order.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the Member holds too broad a concept of trespass.  The law as it stands offers protection to people who are on private property on  legitimate business or, as the amendments put it, with &ldquo;a reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  Setting a dog on such a person &mdash; someone who is not trespassing &mdash; is an  offence. Amendment No 1, with respect to livestock and pets, and amendment No 5,  with respect to attacks on people, allow that, if a person has &ldquo;a reasonable  excuse&rdquo;, he will not be guilty of an offence when he sets his dog on people,  livestock or pets. Importantly, that would not just be the case when faced with  a trespasser on his property but in any place, public or private.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Imagine a situation in which someone sets a dog on a  passer-by in a street or on livestock in a field. Under current law and under  the provisions of the Bill, he or she is guilty of a strict liability offence  against which they can cite no defence if the facts are proven. Therefore, we  would move from the existing provision, whereby, in one very specific context,  it is lawful to set a dog on a person or animals, to a position where anyone  anywhere could set a dog on people or animals if they had a reasonable excuse  to do so. I do not believe that it is the wish of the Assembly to change and  confuse the legislation in that way. Crucially, those amendments would also  leave us in a paradoxical position where, if I am asleep in bed and my dog  bites a burglar, I am automatically guilty of an offence. However, if I wake up  and set the dog on the burglar, I have a defence of reasonable cause. For those  reasons, I cannot support amendment Nos 1 or 5.</p>
