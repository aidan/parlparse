     <p class="B3BodyText">Issues of serious and organised crime are of grave concern  to the people of Northern    Ireland, not only because of ongoing  criminality but because of criminal assets from the past. SOCA has a  significant role in the North, which has been apparent in recent days. We  should have sight of the protocol, and the First Minister and deputy First  Minister should give their view on it to the Assembly at the point of  devolution, in order to recognise the importance of the agency and to create  certainty and confidence in its work in the North. If gaps need to be filled in  and issues of concern need to be worked further, consistent with the House of  Commons Select Committee&rsquo;s report last week, those matters should be attended  to.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">However, first base is to gain knowledge of the document.  The First Minister and the deputy First Minister should come to the Floor of  the Assembly to give the Assembly and the wider public insight into the work of  SOCA in the North and to create confidence in it.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am not aware of whether there is a document on the SOCA relationship. The  Member thinks that there is; he has yet to prove that. In the past, the Member,  who is also a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, has sat with me on  a panel and met SOCA to discuss important matters. There is a level of  accountability that falls within the standards that even the Member accepts are  sovereign matters for the United Kingdom Government. Is the Member suggesting  that, as well as the Policing Board and the special accountability mechanism  that it has with SOCA, we need another board to hold SOCA to account?</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mt Attwood</strong>:  The Member is absolutely correct. SOCA has at times, including recently,  provided briefings to the Policing Board in confidence. As I understand &mdash; and  as I am sure that Mr Paisley Jnr understands &mdash; the relationship between SOCA  and the Policing Board may deepen in the future. However, that is not the only  place where SOCA has a responsibility to share relevant information with  political representatives and other representatives in the North.</p>

However, that is not the only  place where SOCA has a responsibility to share relevant information with  political representatives and other representatives in the North.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The mere fact that the British Government have agreed that  there is a need for a concordat and a protocol governing the work of SOCA in  the event of the devolution of justice powers is proof that they recognise the  need for a relationship between SOCA and the justice Minister. Indeed, in  correspondence to the Assembly and Executive Review Committee &mdash; without  breaching the confidence of that correspondence &mdash; the Secretary of State has  indicated the terms under which information might be shared with the justice  Minister. He has gone even further by saying that it might be for the justice  Minister to decide whether any such information is to be shared with the  justice Committee.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I disagree with the Member if he is saying that SOCA or  some other agency is neither obliged nor required to share information with the  justice Minister or even the justice Committee, and I am not alone in that. The  Secretary of State has accepted that principle, which suggests that there are  good grounds for so doing.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s final point concerned SOCA&rsquo;s overall  accountability. Again, I refer to what the House of Commons Home Affairs  Committee said. Based on the experience of the past 18 months, during which  SOCA&rsquo;s role was broadened, its having taken over the responsibilities of the  Assets Recovery Agency here and in Britain, the Home Affairs Committee  concluded that the accountability of SOCA is something that should be looked  into. It did not go into any great detail but merely established the principle  of some form of accountability for the overall work of SOCA, which, it  described, would take the form of a police authority.</p>
