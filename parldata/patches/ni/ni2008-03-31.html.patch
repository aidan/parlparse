 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and  I seek the Assembly&rsquo;s support for accelerated passage for the Bill to  establish the commission, because early legislative provision is necessary to  expedite meeting the needs of victims and survivors. We realise that general  concerns may arise about the use of accelerated passage for legislation.  However, in this case it is of the utmost importance that the commission be  underpinned without delay by a legislative framework.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee for recognising the need to expedite  the process and for its support for accelerated passage. To engage in the  normal legislative timescale would unduly delay addressing the needs of victims  and survivors. Their needs have been unaddressed for far too long. The First  Minister and I have put much effort and consideration into ensuring that  appropriate structures are established to  address the needs of victims and survivors. We recognise the difficult  issues that surround the definition of  &ldquo;victim&rdquo;. Victims and survivors should consider that issue. We will,  therefore, request that the proposed victims&rsquo; forum makes it a priority to  examine the definition of &ldquo;victim&rdquo; and brings forward its proposals.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must start the required work, and the Bill makes the  minimum changes required to the 2006 Order to enable  a number of people to be appointed to a commis&shy;sion. To facilitate the technical changes that will  underpin the commission&rsquo;s work, the First Minister and I seek the support of the Assembly for the accelerated  passage of the Bill.</p>
