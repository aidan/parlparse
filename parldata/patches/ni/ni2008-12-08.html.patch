 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>:  Veterinary officials from throughout Europe  are due to meet tomorrow, and, no doubt, this is one of the matters that will  be discussed. Will the Minister assure the House that Northern Ireland  pig farmers are not included in any potential blanket restrictions that the EU  may apply?</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, given that the Minister&rsquo;s counterparts in the Irish Republic  were aware of the matter last Monday, will she explain to the House why  officials in her Department were made aware of it only on Friday afternoon?  What happened between Monday and Friday, and, given the supposed consultation  and co-operation between the relevant office in the Irish  Republic and the Minister&rsquo;s office,  why did she have to wait until Sunday to speak to the Minister in the Irish Republic,  from where the problem comes?</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, will the Minister and her Department send a  clear message to farmers, processors and consumers that pig meat can continue  to be processed and eaten safely? She acknowledged that there are welfare  implications if animals must stay on farms. What are the implications for farmers  who have lost, and are losing, their entire source of income, and what will the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) do about that?</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The timeline of events is as follows: on Friday afternoon,  six affected herds were restricted on the Department&rsquo;s traceability system.  Divisional veterinary officers then began to contact keepers of affected herds  to discuss that restriction, and the Department adjusted the status on APHIS in  order to alert meat-inspection staff if animals from affected herds were  presented for slaughter. Moreover, we alerted the Department&rsquo;s quality-assurance  branch, which is responsible for animal feed.</p>
 	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Senior officials in my Department spoke to the FSA to share  information and advice on the potential risks to consumers and the restrictions  that DARD would put in place. That was a precautionary approach, as the scale  of the contamination was not known, as that result was not yet available.</p>
