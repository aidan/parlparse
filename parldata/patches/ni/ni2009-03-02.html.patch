         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Does the Minister not agree that his plans to reform respite care, especially  with respect to Cherry Lodge &mdash; a respite home for children with learning  disabilities &mdash; is seen as nothing more than pure cuts?</p>
         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Let me inform Mr Burns, and anyone  else who cares to listen, that these are not my proposals: they are the  proposals of the Northern Health and Social Care Trust. I am required to find  &pound;700 million in efficiency savings over the next three years. The trusts must  bear a proportion of that responsibility, and so they bring forward proposals.  I will weigh those proposals seriously, including in terms of impact on the  strategies that are in place; for example, the Bamford Review and Caring for  Carers, our strategy for looking after carers. They will have an effect on how  the implementation group rolls out that strategy.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Burns has a better idea, he should avail himself of  the consultation process. I presume that he has put practical proposals to the  Northern Trust to allow it to go in a different direction, if that is what he  wants.</p>
-        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McCrea</strong>:  The Minister rightly says that the proposals are not his. However, the final  decision will be his. Can he assure me that the very strong opposition of  parents and families &mdash; not only in Randalstown or South   Antrim, but over a very wide area &mdash; who will suffer the effects of  such a closure, will be fully taken into consideration by him in his  determination? What they say must not be dismissed in a paper exercise.</p>

         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can confirm that the  consultation is genuine. This is by no means a done deal, and no decision has  been taken.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">My criteria are as follows: I must be satisfied that the  service delivered to patients will be either maintained or enhanced. That  includes the patients who are looked after in Cherry Lodge. I must point out,  however, that that is a very old building that requires substantial investment.  The process has yet to be completed, and I am still some way from reaching a  decision. The trust has yet to come to a conclusion, and its board will not  meet until the end of the month.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone must understand that I must find the money. If  Members do not want me to find it &mdash; if they do not want the trust to find it  here &mdash; they must present alternatives. They have to be able to tell me how I  can find the money otherwise. To date, no one has come forward with practical  suggestions about other ways in which I can find the &pound;700 million. These are  efficiency savings.</p>
