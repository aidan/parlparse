       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Question No 4, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim  bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire fosta as an fhreagra a thug s&eacute;. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute;  de an gcreideann s&eacute; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an Bille seo bunaithe ar chearta.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his response. In his view, should  the Bill be rights-based?</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Without getting into the legal  terminology into which the Member may wish to draw me, there are important  benefits in the Bill as far as mental capacity and mental health provisions are  concerned. The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to put in place substitute decision-making  arrangements for those who are unable to make their own decisions. However,  that process must include strong protections for the individuals concerned. It  will have a wide application and cover decisions about a person&rsquo;s medical  treatment, welfare and financial affairs. As far as possible, it will also  encourage participation in the decision-making process to ensure that the views  of the patient and others are taken into account. It is very much about  ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of the individual concerned.</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister state whether epilepsy will be covered specifically in any  such Bill?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: This issue very much follows on  from the strategy that came from the Bamford Review of Mental Health and  Learning Disability, which includes dementia, autism and acquired brain and  stroke injury. Epilepsy would not be covered by a Bill that encompassed mental  capacity and mental health provisions. However, that is not to say that  patients who suffer from epilepsy will not be covered; they will be covered,  but perhaps because of another condition that they have, such as a learning  disability.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to a single Bill. I believe that Northern Ireland  has the opportunity to be a world leader in the area. What actions can his  Department take in advance of the next Assembly&rsquo;s consideration of a Bill,  particularly on the Bamford action plan and any equality impact assessment of  the legislation?</p>
