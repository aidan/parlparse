 	      <p class="B3BodyText">That was recently demonstrated with the 1&middot;2 mega&shy;watt  marine-current turbine project &mdash;SeaGen &mdash; which began generating renewable  electricity in July 2008. It is the world&rsquo;s first commercial-scale tidal system  to be connected to a local grid. The deployment of the system at Strangford has  put Northern Ireland on the map for tidal-marine renewables, and that augurs  well for the exploitation of tidal resources off our north coast.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI)  is in the final stages of commissioning a strategic environmental assessment of  offshore wind and marine renewable energy in Northern Ireland waters. That will  enable DETI to work with the Crown Estate &mdash; owner of the seabed &mdash; to issue a  competitive call for private-sector investors in order to develop commercial  projects at certain offshore sites. The strategic environmental assessment,  including the consultation phases, will be completed by spring 2010.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim period, DETI, the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency and the Crown Estate will continue to work with developers  who wish either to deploy pre-commercial or demonstration-stage devices &mdash; such  as the marine-current turbines at Strangford Lough &mdash; or to prepare their  proposals before the competitive call for commercial projects in 2010.</p>
