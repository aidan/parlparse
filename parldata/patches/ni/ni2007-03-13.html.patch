 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Members will understand that it would be inappropriate for  me to discuss that report in the Chamber. However, I intend to meet the Secretary  of State to discuss the outcome of that review, and the Commission has agreed  to engage in discussions with the parties in the coming weeks. We will issue  invitations to you, Dr Paisley, and the other party leaders to discuss this  matter. The Commission must consider not only the implementation of the review;  there is also the matter of cost.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Ongoing security has also been looked at. As most Members  know, we have introduced an additional PSNI presence. We have asked people to  be vigilant about where they go, and I ask every Member, not just the new ones,  to listen to the advice of the Doorkeepers or of any of my staff. If anyone has  any queries, please go in the first instance to the Deputy Chief Executive or  the Keeper of the House, who will advise about what can and cannot be done  until we get the security review finished. Like you, Dr Paisley, I want that  completed as soon as possible, and I thank you for asking about it.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their co-operation and patience during  the signing of the Roll. The Roll will be placed in the Chamber on sitting days  to enable any Member who has not yet signed it to do so. Standing Order 4(a)  states that my decision on whether a Member has taken his or her seat in  accordance with that Standing Order is final. I can only make that decision  after scrutinising all of the entries on the Roll. I intend to make an  announcement on this matter at the start of the next meeting of the Assembly.</p>
