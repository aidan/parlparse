         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am speaking in the capacity of  an individual MLA when I ask the Minister to engage formally with the leading  promoters of Irish traditional music in Ulster, which is, of course, Comhaltas  Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann. They organise fleadhanna at community, county and provincial  level. I was surprised that the Arts Council said at the Committee for Culture,  Arts and Leisure meeting last week that it has never formally engaged with  Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann other than a few small awards through &lsquo;Awards for  All&rsquo;. I ask the Minister and his Department to meet formally with Comhaltas  Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann to consider Irish traditional music and the organisation&rsquo;s  place in festivals or fleadhanna. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Member has alluded to what I assume, to  paraphrase him, is a lack of communication between the Arts Council and the  body to which he referred &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> &mdash; which I am  not going even to attempt to repeat, because I do not understand the name. I  would ask him to establish whether that body has written to the Arts Council to  request a meeting to see where Irish traditional music can be catered for, and  I would be interested, and surprised, if there was a negative response. Any  such approach should be made to the Arts Council and to local councils, which  are now responsible for the community festivals fund, and would consider any  approach made to them.</p>
         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he outline the rationale behind the  transfer of the community festivals fund to local authorities?</p>
-        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I hope that I have the support of virtually  everyone in the House when I say that community festival funding ought to be  devolved down, as close to the grass roots as possible. That is where the  applications, primarily from local groups or localities that want to promote  particular types of festivals, are from. The better place to assess the  viability of such festivals, their promotion, and their development is among  local councils. That was the rationale.</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">The Tourist Board felt that community festival funding did  not readily fit within a tourism development remit. Under the RPA, it was  agreed that that should not transfer to the Tourist Board, but should go to  local government. It is still in the early stages; we are only into the first  year of the assessment of local government promotion of community festivals.  Let us see how that works over the first two or three years. I trust and hope  that it will be a success.</p>
         <p class="H5StageHeading">UTV Cuts</p>
         <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what steps he is taking to  offset the cuts proposed by UTV in response to the Ofcom Public Service  Broadcasting Review.&nbsp; <a name=AQO1201/09>(AQO 1201/09)</a></p>
