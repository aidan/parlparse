     <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That action is reflected in my Department&rsquo;s  addendum to the Programme for Government, and I wish to provide Members with  information on the processes and personnel involved in delivering that review.  In doing so, I thank members of the Justice Committee for the advice that they  gave when my officials brought them our initial thoughts. I have given careful  consideration to the matters raised, and have been pleased to take account of  those thoughtful observations in structuring the review.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">To put the review in context, the youth justice system in Northern Ireland  has seen much change for the better over the past 10 years, following the  criminal justice review. We have much to be proud of in what has been achieved.  However, it is important to stand back and to take a critical look at where we  are and what we need to do in order to further refine and improve our  approaches to addressing youth offending.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">We do that in the new context of fully devolved  arrangements for justice and policing, now firmly embedded in the Northern  Ireland Administration, and a financially challenging future, as well as in the  context of the challenge that I have already set of reshaping and rebalancing  the justice system to see less offending, fewer victims and safer, more  confident communities.</p>
-    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>To that end, I am  commissioning a review of youth justice, the terms of reference for which will  cover</strong>: existing processes, partnerships, interventions, structures and  strategic linkages; legislation relating to the various statutory interventions;  the balance of emphasis among prevention, effective intervention and  reintegration and the associated systemic and cross-cutting issues; good  practice in Northern Ireland and beyond; and information sharing and management  arrangements between agencies and the measurement of outcomes.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">The review will give particular regard to the statutory  aims of the youth justice system, international obligations in that area, best  practice in Northern Ireland  and beyond and the effective use of available resources. It will be expert-led,  wide-ranging, consultative and comprehensive, and will cover all aspects of the  youth justice system from the age of criminal responsibility through to more  effective measures to prevent or to address offending among young people.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Outline terms of reference for the review have been  considered by the Justice Committee and have been made available to Members  together with a transcript of my statement. The terms of reference are  described as &ldquo;outline&rdquo; because I see them as a necessary framework to support  the review process while remaining sufficiently flexible to incorporate any  changes that make sense as we open up the debate.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In considering how the review should be taken forward and  by whom, I consider it vital that we achieve an appropriate balance between  independent experts and those who know the current youth justice system in  Northern Ireland, its history and development. I am, therefore, establishing a  three-person review team for this purpose. In doing so, I have listened to the  clear advice of members of the Justice Committee.</p>

Early on Friday 29 October, Roads  Service, NIW and Rivers Agency responded to forecasts of heavy rain by checking  key infrastructure. Roads Service arranged for areas that are prone to flooding  to be checked and gully gratings cleared, specifically in areas where leaf fall  had taken place. Additional gully crews were put in place to deal with reports  of flooding, and additional staff assisted in the supervision and operation of  our normal and after-hours telephone system.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">For Rivers Agency, routine maintenance on high-risk grilles  in east Belfast  had been carried out that morning in advance of any potential heavy rainfall.  Additionally, Rivers Agency teams attended those areas affected and utilised  contractors to check that high-risk grilles in east Belfast remained clear. Rivers Agency  continues to carry out regular maintenance on grilles and designated water  ports in east Belfast  to ensure free flow.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The flooding was not caused by any failure to maintain the  operational effectiveness of storm-water gullies or the road drainage system;  the road drainage infrastructure was overwhelmed by the deluge of rain that  fell during a relatively short time. In addition, I have been advised by NIW  that it does not believe that the surface flooding experienced in parts of east  Belfast was a  direct failure of its assets. NIW will continue to maintain its assets in east Belfast, including  through inspection of waste-water pumping stations and combined storm overflows.  It has staff and contractors available on a 24/7 basis to respond to any  incident of flooding reported by customers through either the water line or the  flooding incident line.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">The argument that students benefit financially from  education throughout their working lives and should, therefore, contribute  differentially does not apply to other sectors of public expenditure. For example,  there is no requirement on former beneficiaries of healthcare or social  security benefits to make repayments once they have established an income.  Therefore, why do we attach that philosophy to higher and further education  students? Surely almost all wage earners are either graduates or benefit from  the skills, knowledge and custom of graduates. All of us benefit from having  graduates in society, from their importance to the economy to their delivery of  services. Therefore, the fairest social policy should be that we all share the  burden of the cost of education.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Some universities are arguing for higher levels of funding  so that they can compete internationally with other universities involved in  research. The additional money required is for research, not teaching, and that  is fair enough. However, students, particularly undergraduates, benefit only  marginally from university research. The quality of the research carried out by  a particular institution may carry a certain kudos and add value to its degrees,  but most undergraduate learning is based on existing materials, not on pushing  the barriers of knowledge. What is important to most undergraduates is the  quality of teaching, not the quality of research. Therefore, why should an  undergraduate pay for a university&rsquo;s research when most of them are not allowed  near its state-of-the-art research facilities until they study at postgraduate  level?</p>

A number of them are in the  Building, and they want to ensure that future generations of young people in Northern Ireland  have the opportunity to access education at a higher level. They do not want  circumstances in which there are barriers. That applies not only to  lower-income families but to middle-income families.</p>

Given the SDLP&rsquo;s  role leading up to and being part of the campaign around the Russell Group&rsquo;s  proposals, and the issues around the elitism of universities across Britain and some in Northern Ireland, we cannot, under  any circumstances, accept or tolerate the amendment. I appeal to Members on the  other side of the House to think carefully and to let us unite behind the  motion.

Do students get additional  resources, top-of-the-range libraries, sporting equipment etc? It is a valid  question. I have no doubt that people <strong>do  not mind paying if they get a service in return. However, the question is this</strong>:  where does the money from student fees go? Does it go towards paying  universities&rsquo; running costs? Does it go towards paying additional salaries to  lecturers and whoever else, or is it spent to benefit the students? I do not  know whether such information exists, but I remain to be convinced that student  fees benefit students.</p>

The Minister is right in proposing that we need to look at  how best to tackle the issue in Northern    Ireland. There has to be a detailed  examination of the issue. However, if we adopt the motion, we will prejudge  that outcome and take it at the beginning of the process rather than at the  end.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than prejudicing the outcome, the amendment  addresses four principles that should apply to any final agreement. First, that  third-level education in Northern Ireland remains affordable; secondly, that  students from the most disadvantaged backgrounds must be assisted; thirdly,  that we are opposed to and reject the removal of a cap on student fees; and,  fourthly, that we are opposed to a two-tier university system. Those are four  principles on which we should be in a position to unite.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister quite rightly highlighted, this is about  balance. It is about getting a balance that is fair to the students of Northern Ireland, to the students from Northern Ireland who are studying in other parts  of the United Kingdom  and who have largely been ignored, and to the universities.
