     <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs talked about the importance of access to ATMs in  rural areas. He mentioned the cost to many people of a round trip. Designated wards  in his constituency include Blackhead, Whitehead and Ballygalley, where he  knows that the loss of the shop has caused problems. The important issue is  that the cost of accessing a small amount of cash might be quite considerable  in rural areas from which people may have to travel some distance to an ATM.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs and other Members mentioned the potential  long-term impact of the thefts not from, but of, the cash machines at present.  Without trying to provoke controversy in a debate that has so far been free of  it and in which we have had total agreement, I say to Mr Beggs and others that  after next Tuesday, if they vote in the right way, they will have ample  opportunity and justification to raise such issues with a Justice Minister in  the House who will hold the Chief Constable and police to account. I am sure  that, just as he finds it a good experience to have me here as Finance Minister  to talk about how to make the provision of those machines viable, he would  welcome the opportunity of having a Justice Minister to talk about how to make  ATMs safe.</p>

I  will give way.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: My  point, which was valid in the context of the debate, was that having to pay  rates might be the final straw that prevents banks from replacing ATMs.  Furthermore, if the Minister and his colleagues are convinced about the rightness  of what they agreed at Hillsborough, they are within their rights, and have  enough votes, to take that decision themselves.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As the Member knows, not only am I convinced, but I  have sought and will continue to seek to convince others that the right  decision was made at Hillsborough. I am glad that he raised the point, and I  would have been disappointed had he not done so. I am simply saying that the  question of whether ATMs are retained in rural areas is a security issue.  Security could have an impact on whether the machines stay in rural areas.  Therefore, it would be much better to have a local Minister of Justice to  debate with, question and call to account. If the Member agrees with that, I am  sure that he will not act hypocritically by voting against the opportunity to  do so. I shall leave that point with him and other Members who would like to be  able to discuss such security issues in the future.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised a couple of issues. He pointed out that  the rates exemption resulted in a modest 16% increase in the number of ATMs.  One might be disappointed that the increase in the number of machines that have  been installed in those areas is not higher. However, at a time when many other  services are being removed from rural areas, at least the trend has not been  downward. In contrast to what has happened in rural areas to village shops,  post offices, garages, and so forth, all of which have experienced a downward  trend, it is one area in which there has been an upward trend.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">Public consultation on the draft Policy concluded on 18  September 2009 with a total of 14 responses received from organisations and  individuals, including a combined response from the Islanders. The responses  were supportive of the overall policy and its aims and objectives and also the  proposed Forum and Action Plan.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Officials from my department held a very productive and  successful consultation event on Rathlin   Island on 7 October 2009.  The event was attended by around two thirds of the Islanders who among other  things expressed a desire for a healthy community with affordable housing and  education all playing their part; better roads; help for farming and fishing  industry; nursing cover and efforts to keep young people on the Island. There  was also the suggestion that a Rathlin brand should be created, i.e. a green  island with a neutral carbon footprint; to expand the use of renewable energy  and recyclables; to maximise the use of local produce; to extend the  attractions beyond the puffin season; and to establish an island of festivals.</p>
