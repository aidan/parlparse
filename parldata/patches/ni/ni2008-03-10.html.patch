 	        <p class="B3BodyText">As the junior Minister said, the Order provides for the  transfer of the functions of the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland from the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to  the Department of Finance and Personnel, thereby enabling the Ordnance  Survey to become part of Land and Property Services. My Committee&rsquo;s  responsibility for scrutinising the Order comes as a result of OFMDFM&rsquo;s  responsibility for legislation that relates to the functions of Departments. My  Committee was initially briefed on the rule on 12 December 2007, and we wrote  to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Committee for Finance  and Personnel, which are responsible for scrutinising the agencies being brought  together via the Order. Both Committees indicated that they were content with  the proposals in the draft Order. On 20 February 2008, my Committee <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">formally considered the draft Order alongside the  report from the Examiner of Statutory Rules and agreed to recommend that  it be affirmed by the Assembly.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">My Committee wishes to see action being taken to reduce the number of public bodies in Northern Ireland.  On Wednesday, my Committee will take evidence from OFMDFM officials on the  progress being made by Departments in reducing the number of quangos &mdash;  currently 81 &mdash; in Northern    Ireland. At the same meeting, the Committee  will also take evidence on OFMDFM proposals to introduce a public authorities reform Bill, which will seek to make a further  reduction in the number of public bodies. The Departments (Transfer of  Functions) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2008 is a small step in the review  of public administration commitment to the reduction of excessive public administration; it is, nevertheless, worthy of our  support.</p>

Will the junior Minister  reassure the House that OSNI will be able to deliver and enhance its work as an  agency of the Department of Finance and Personnel?</p>
