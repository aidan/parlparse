 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before commenting on the substantive matter that is before  the House, as Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister, I wish to express my gratitude to the people who  assisted the Committee during the inquiry. I offer my appreciation to the  Committee Clerk and the Committee secretariat for their work in arranging what  was a major inquiry, during which the Committee considered submissions from  around 50 organisations. I also express my appreciation to the Assembly&rsquo;s  Research and Library Services for the high-quality research and analysis that  it provided to the Committee, and to Hansard for its patient and accurate  reporting of evidence sessions with almost 30 organisations.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is grateful to all those who provided  evidence during the inquiry, including officials from the seven Departments  that were called to respond to questions from members on the policies and plans  that the Executive are putting in place to tackle child poverty. I also thank  my colleagues on the Committee for their commitment to the inquiry, and for the  constructive and collective approach that they all adopted in trying to find  evidence-based solutions to the challenge of child poverty.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, I wish to mention our Department&rsquo;s good  work in developing policies to tackle social exclusion among lone parents.  Considering the latest headline poverty figures for 2005-06, it is estimated  that approximately a quarter of our children were living in poverty. Of those  children, 35% lived in lone-parent households. Therefore, it was extremely  important to complete that work, which, as well as having significant input  from the voluntary and community sector, benefited from the work of the  British-Irish Council&rsquo;s social inclusion strand. Our findings will soon be  presented to Ministers, and the report will be reinforced by some of the  messages emerging from the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry, particularly in respect of  barriers to economic activity.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">On examining statistics relating to lone parents, we discovered  that 45% of adults from lone-parent households are economically inactive &mdash; a  fact that practically guarantees that children from such families will be among  the most disadvantaged in society. Therefore, it follows logically that any  action to positively promote the social inclusion of lone parents will have a  beneficial impact on children in such households and will help us to achieve  our Programme for Government child-poverty targets.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are concerned with results, and families that face an  uncertain future due to rising costs expect us, as elected leaders, to deliver  change. I thank the Committee for its work, and, by working together, the  Executive and the Assembly can tackle the significant challenges that we face,  meet our Programme for Government commitments and deliver an equal and more  prosperous future that is free from poverty. I know that the Assembly is united  in that goal, and we will, of course, carefully consider the report when we  produce our strategy. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his opening remarks, Danny Kennedy reflected on the  changed economic realities. Even during the inquiry, those realities changed.  Although the macroeconomic factors are largely beyond the control of the  Assembly, the Executive are under additional pressure to address urgently the  consequences of those factors. Jimmy Spratt and Dolores Kelly voiced those  concerns. Jim Wells echoed the concerns of several contributors to the inquiry  when he questioned how realistic the current targets are in the context of the  difficult financial climate. Indeed, some felt that we would need to run very  hard just to stand still. I hope that the Executive will be able to prevent  more families from falling into the poverty trap, even if they are not able to  completely eradicate child poverty in the foreseeable future.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">If poverty is not to grow, it is essential that we make the  effort to address those issues and to ensure that Departments have well-defined  and measurable targets. Jim Shannon mentioned that the Assembly has the tools  and the power to address child poverty. He also recognised the need to work  with Westminster  and other partners in order to address the wider issues; indeed, Patsy McGlone  reflected that point.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Wells and Anna Lo both recognised that lack of access  to childcare, to play facilities and to early intervention is not only a  barrier to work for parents but is an impediment to children reaching their  full potential. Indeed, it can compound that cycle of poverty and deprivation that  is experienced by households generation on generation.</p>

Corrective action must therefore focus on addressing those factors that  may act as disincentives or obstacles to women who might otherwise wish to  apply. With those considerations in mind, employers have put in place a range  of family-friendly policies &mdash; for example, more flexible working hours and job  sharing &mdash; to help individuals balance their school and family commitments and  to encourage female staff to participate in the professional qualification for  headship training programme.</p>
