 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, it is clear that if Northern Ireland is to  achieve economic success on the required scale, a cocktail of measures is  needed &mdash; perhaps we shall all need a cocktail after this mammoth session. That  cocktail of measures must be based on up-to-date and reliable labour market  research data, which should indicate those areas where there are, or are likely  to be, skills shortages. Further and higher education colleges must be in a  position to respond to needs in a flexible manner, so that the long-term and  short-term requirements of business can be met at regional and local levels.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The critical role of R&amp;D must be realised and supported  by tax incentives that are broad and simple enough to encourage more  businesses, especially in the SME sector, which is Northern Ireland&rsquo;s largest  sector, to become involved. That might be achieved through clustering and the  introduction of R&amp;D champions, as suggested by the Federation of Small  Businesses (FSB), or by encouraging those in the SME sector to become partners  with larger businesses or universities. Northern Ireland can no longer languish  at a private business level of 0&middot;5% investment in R&amp;D, while its neighbours  continue to invest up to two or three times that amount. If the chronic  shortfall is to be addressed, such an approach is needed.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I am also drawn to the knowledge bank idea, especially with  its commercial manager&rsquo;s acting as a single point of contact for companies with  high-growth potential. Members will have experience of having to wrestle with  half a dozen agencies before a simple decision can be made. UUTech Ltd&rsquo;s  suggestion for special economic zones, with economic potential for companies  engaged in collaborative R&amp;D, is worthy of note. DEL&rsquo;s collaboration fund  for further and higher education has potential, and, although it is time  limited at the moment, following evaluation, it would be worth pursuing. Also  worth pursuing is the SMILE project, which stands for small medium innovative  learning enterprises, in which the further education colleges target SMEs under  the banner of ANIC.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that all sections of Northern Ireland society  stand willing to play their parts in this vital enterprise. Although the issues  are being discussed here in somewhat of a vacuum, my party stands ready to play  its part in bringing rural prosperity to all parts of society. I support the  motion.</p>
 		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  The motion serves two critical and highly significant objectives. First, the  subgroup&rsquo;s report is based on the full support of all the parties that have met  over the past weeks. It is also based on the significant input of  representatives from a wide range of interest groups, and that alone should  commend it not only to Members but to Departments and to the community and  business sectors. Secondly, the report provides parties with a key opportunity  to demonstrate their seriousness to restore the political institutions by 24  November.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Before I address the report&rsquo;s economy-related content, I  will focus on its second purpose. As one of those Members who participated  regularly in the deliberations of the Preparation for Government Committee and  during the early stages of the economic challenges subgroup, I must confess  that it was not always a positive experience. Difficult things were said, and  accusations of ill will &mdash; and even worse &mdash; were not uncommon. Comments were  misinterpreted, and offence was often taken. However, alongside that, Members  who participated will acknowledge that, as those keen anoraks who study Hansard  will have discovered, there was some good humour. The staff were wonderful and,  in that remark, I include those who chaired the meetings.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We must also consider  how we can make more use of planning gain for major infrastructural  improvements. We have been doing just that in Lisburn, which is in my  constituency. The two major multi-million-pound roads projects that have been  undertaken in the Lisburn area in the past  five years have been privately financed. The project at Sprucefield and  the work on the north Lisburn feeder road  are both making a major contribution to improving the traffic situation.  A third project, the Knockmore link &mdash; which will link the M1 to the north  feeder road &mdash; has been proposed and will also be privately financed. In  developing our infrastructure in Northern Ireland, more emphasis must be placed  on planning gain, which can be used to benefit the whole community.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">My hon Friend the Member for East Londonderry, Mr Campbell,  touched on tourism. For years, we have engaged in the visitor-centre approach  to tourism, but we must adopt a big-picture  vision. We have something very valuable to offer. Our greatest tourist  asset and selling point is the beauty of our country. Are we exploiting that to  its full potential? I am not sure that we are.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I recently attended the  launch in Parliament Buildings of a  study that explores the possible benefits of reopening the Ulster Canal. The reopening of the Northern  Ireland canal network could greatly contribute to opening up the entire  Province to tourism and could act as a driver for regeneration. The Ulster  Canal, which links into the Erne-Shannon waterway system, flows into Lough  Neagh. We are also working with Belfast City Council, Castlereagh Borough  Council and Craigavon Borough Council to explore the potential of opening the  Lagan Canal. A visitor to Northern Ireland could get on a boat at Belfast and  go all the way up the Lagan &mdash; preferably not in a bubble &mdash; to Lough Neagh, into  the Ulster Canal system, down into the Erne-Shannon waterway system to  Limerick, or north on the lower River Bann to Coleraine. That would open up  this country to tourism, and it would be an attractive offering. Such a project  would cost a lot of money and require vision, but that is the kind of project  on which we must now focus if we are to promote tourism development in Northern  Ireland. It is big-picture stuff, but that is what Northern Ireland needs.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The farming community faces two immediate problems: first,  the difficulties that it currently experiences; and secondly, the future. The  farming community has had a very difficult time in the past decade. It has  suffered the BSE crisis, foot-and-mouth disease, the high exchange rate of  sterling and decreasing produce prices. Twenty years ago, in 1986, milk prices  averaged over 16p a litre. Some 10 or 11 years ago, they reached between 26p  and 30p a litre. Today, farmers receive around 15p per litre, which is a  reduction of 50% in the past decade. That is quite unsustainable.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Again, in 1995 and 1996  &mdash; some 10 or 11 years ago &mdash; the  price of finished beef was about &pound;2&middot;65 a kilogram; now we are lucky to  make &pound;2 a kilogram, or less. The number of farms in Northern Ireland has  decreased by one third in the past 20 years, from some 42,000 to just 28,000. I  am not saying that rational&shy;isation is bad for the economy, but it is bad for  the traditional family unit. Farmers must realise the business sense of the  agriculture industry.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Support is a vital lifeline for smallholders in the farming  community. When farmers make simple mistakes, they are penalised. When the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development makes a mistake, no penalties  are applied. All I ask is for flexibility and leeway within the system and for  some common sense.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is a clear indication that farmers in Northern  Ireland are more likely to be penalised for a breach of regulations or small  misdemeanours than in any other European country. The Department&rsquo;s own figures  reveal that &pound;2&middot;8 million has been withheld from single farm payments to  Northern Ireland farmers. In the Republic of Ireland, the corresponding sum is  just &pound;229,000. I suggest that when DARD staff make mistakes, they should be  penalised, and compensation should be paid to farmers. Farmers only want a  level playing field.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to  tourism, which suffers greatly from a  lack of proper planning and administration in Northern Ireland. So much  of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s potential tourism is lost to Scotland and to the  Republic. Despite that, there is a growing tourism industry in Northern  Ireland. Visitor spend in the Province has risen from &pound;250 million in 1995 to  &pound;357 million in 2005 &mdash; an increase of over 40%.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The number of visitors  to the Province has increased; between 2004 and 2005, there was an  increase of 32% in the number of visitors from Europe, 19% in the number from  North America and 12% in the number from Australia and New Zealand. That  happened in spite of the fierce competition to which I have referred from  Scotland, England, mainland Europe and the Republic of Ireland. Cheap flights  throughout Europe have caused deeper problems for the Northern Ireland domestic  market. However, I am pleased to say that we appear to be overcoming those  problems.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Recent Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) initiatives,  such as the five signature projects, should help to combat the successful  campaigns of our neighbouring competitors. However, some areas of Northern Ireland have been neglected by those  projects; I would highlight the fact that County Fermanagh, one of the  best tourism areas in Northern Ireland, was not included. That has been offset by the NITB&rsquo;s acceptance of the  Destination Fermanagh project, which was recently launched in the county. There  are many other initiatives to be proud of in Northern Ireland.</p>
