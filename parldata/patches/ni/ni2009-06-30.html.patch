       <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of child protection and the safeguarding of  children is a key priority for all of us and an issue which impacts on the work  of several departments and indeed that of the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Because of the cross cutting nature of this issue and its  direct link to the &lsquo;living in safety and with stability&rsquo; aspect of the 10 Year  strategy we took the initiative to co-ordinate the development of this  Statement. It is an issue which we also continue to progress through the work  of the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Children and Young People which has  identified &lsquo;safeguarding&rsquo; as a priority.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Importantly, whilst the statement represents a &lsquo;snap shot&rsquo;  in time, it also provides a clear route map for the road ahead.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">The Delivery Report provides a robust assessment of  progress up to 31 March 2009 against our key goals and commitments as set out  in the Programme for Government and the departmental targets set out under the  23 Public Service Agreements (PSA). The report also provides an overview of  departmental initiatives to address the equality and good relations issues  highlighted in the EQIA undertaken at a strategic level on the PfG, Budget and  Investment Strategy.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that substantial progress has been made in the  first year of delivery. The Report acknowledges, however, the significant  economic challenge we now face and the potential impact this may have on  delivery over the longer term. Notwithstanding this, the progress to date and  the degree to which departments have collectively engaged to drive delivery  provide optimism for positive outcomes in the longer term.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the findings of the Delivery Report, we have  decided that reviews should be undertaken on 5 key areas with the aim of  overcoming potential barriers to effective delivery. Three reviews will be  undertaken at Ministerial level, these are:</p>
