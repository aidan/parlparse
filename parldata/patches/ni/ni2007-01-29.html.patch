   		<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern that more than 100  adults and young people with learning disabilities have been forced to remain  in Muckamore Abbey Hospital, Antrim &mdash; some for periods extending to several  years &mdash; because appropriate care within the community  is not available; demands a full inquiry into the situation to ensure it cannot occur again; recognises the  frequently undervalued contribution  of staff, families and carers; and calls upon Government to implement  urgently the recommendations of the Equal Lives Learning Disability Report of  the Bamford Mental Health Review.</p>
   		<p class="B3BodyText">As Members of the DUP, Mrs Robinson MP and I tabled the  motion, which should appeal to all in the House.</p>
   		<p class="B3BodyText">Many people across the Province were touched to learn of  the plight of those with learning disabilities &mdash; including children and young  people &mdash; and who were prevented from leaving hospital on account of  insufficient funding for community services. It seems strange that the places  in which they were supposed to receive benefits developed into places in which  they were imprisoned.</p>
