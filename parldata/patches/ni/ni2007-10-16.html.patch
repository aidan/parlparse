 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft framework proposed the creation of a duty on  public authorities to prepare a language scheme specifying the measures that  they would take on the use of the Irish  language in the provision of their services. The establishment of a new  oversight body &mdash; an Irish language commissioner &mdash; was also proposed. The  commissioner would have the function of approving and overseeing language  schemes.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, it was proposed that a person would be able to  use Irish in legal proceedings in courts and tribunals sitting in Northern Ireland,  subject to the provision of notice and the interests of justice. Finally, a  draft provision was also included enabling certain statutory forms to be made  available in Irish.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">A total of 11,000 written responses were received, as well  as petitions containing 629 names. Of the total number of respondents, 7,500 &mdash;  65% &mdash; indicated support for some form of legislation.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The announcement she has made is contrary to a process set  out by the Executive, and the decision is not consistent with the advice  offered by the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and senior Crown counsel. I  believe her decision is also a breach of the ministerial code and the Pledge of  Office. In such circumstances, I wonder whether it is sensible for Members to  ask questions based on such a statement.</p>

Some of the issues that Mr Robinson  has raised in his point of order are extremely serious to the House. Due to the  point of order, and the manner in which it was raised, I intend to suspend the  sitting.</p>
