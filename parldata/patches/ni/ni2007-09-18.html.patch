 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly Government are jointly taking the lead on the  Council&rsquo;s work on social inclusion. That group is now examining child  poverty, with a focus on lone parents. The work is focused on transition points  in people&rsquo;s lives and the proper provision  of support at those times. The British-Irish Council is also examining  how Administrations identify, and take  account of, the views of parents, young people and children when  formulating their policies.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Demography is the newest work sector, and it is led by the  Scottish Executive. The group has recently commenced work and has agreed to  focus its efforts on migration, which has a broad and varied impact on the  eight members. I am glad to say that the Minister for Employment and Learning  is representing the Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s interests in that sector.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Mr Speaker, I can report that the next British-Irish Council summit meeting will  be held in late 2007 and will be hosted by Ireland at a venue to be announced.  I think that I should add: here endeth the first lesson.</p>

That matter is of particular interest to the Committee  for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, which will  be considering terms of reference for an inquiry into child poverty at its next  meeting. I ask the First Minister to state when we can expect a report on child  poverty from the British-Irish  Council. If a full report will not be available for some time &mdash; as is  likely &mdash; will the First Minister share the findings of the British-Irish Council with the Committee  on a regular and ongoing basis?</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted the mutually beneficial co-operation  taken forward between Ministers and Departments in the areas for co-operation.  The Council agreed to take forward the review provided for in the St Andrews  Agreement of the North/South implement&shy;ation bodies and areas for co-operation.  The review will commence in September 2007, and a final report will be  presented to the first NSMC plenary meeting in 2008. The review will be  undertaken by a group including senior officials and an advisory panel of four  expert advisers, two to be nominated by the Executive and two by the Irish  Government. The Council noted that the Irish Government would consult their  social partners in relation to the North/South consultative forum. It also  noted the review of arrangements for consulting civic society here and agreed  to consider the matter on completion of that review.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the provisions of the St Andrews  Agreement relating to the North/South parliamentary forum. It recognised that  any development of a joint parliamentary  forum was a matter for the Assembly and the Oireachtas. Officials from  the two Administrations were charged with making contact with the Assembly and  the Houses of the Oireachtas, and with reporting back to the NSMC at the earliest  opportunity on the prospects for the development of such a forum. The Council  considered and approved a schedule of NSMC meetings to take place over the  coming months and agreed that its next meeting in plenary format would be held  in Dundalk towards the end of the year.

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to detract in any way from the seriousness of  the issue. However, we must be careful not to create mass hysteria about young  people playing sport. Dr Farry mentioned that in his speech. There is the  danger that we create a fear among children and particularly among parents, who  will be afraid to allow their children to participate in sport. Sport is a good  thing. Sport can be beneficial to a child&rsquo;s  general health with regard to fitness and to social development. Sport and recreational activity is vital as we fight the  increase in obesity which is prevalent among the young.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say that we should do nothing &mdash; quite the  contrary. We must be realistic and measured in how we respond to the problem of  sudden death syndrome and look at a wide range of options. The Reverend Dr  Coulter made two excellent points &mdash; and not just because I was going to make  them as well. He mentioned the age at which young people should be screened for  the condition. Usually, children under the age of 14 will not be screened  because ECG testing on prepubescent children is inconclusive.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">He also told us that if a heart defect is detected, there  is an onus to take action to remedy it. He also said that such a diagnosis  affects that person&rsquo;s ability to get mortgages,  life insurance and so on. That is an important point that must not be  forgotten.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon told us that screening is compulsory in Italy. Indeed, in the University  of Ulster at Jordanstown in my  constituency of East Antrim, an excellent CRY  clinic is run once a week. It is supported nationally by Steve Redgrave and Ian  Botham and, locally, by Gary Longwell and Pat Jennings. I have learnt from my  correspondence with CRY that, over the past year, 2,000 to 3,000 people across the UK have been screened and  that that number is increasing every year. I believe that the intention is to  create more such facilities in Northern Ireland,  particularly in Londonderry. Mobile screening  units that can go to clubs and other venues on request are also available. That  is useful, as CRY provides that service to elite athletes or those who have  been referred by their GPs for some of the symptoms that we heard about at the  start of the debate. However, as we have  heard already, those proposals are not perfect.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we do not create panic among parents  and children who enjoy playing sport, but that we investigate those who are  most at risk and those who are involved in elite sports at a young age.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">I, therefore, support the amendment and hope that it will  lead to a fully costed and evidence-based case for helping to reduce avoidable  cardiac deaths among young people.</p>
