       <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is well aware that some people fall into the  NEET category &mdash; not in education, employment or training. He knows also that I  have asked him about the Future Jobs Fund, which, it seems, applies in Britain but not  here. Why is the Minister not trying to tackle that category of young people  who are aged between 16 and 24? There are more than 50,000 of them in the North  of Ireland. An initiative such as the Future Jobs Fund would give people the  opportunity of training and, from that, employment. Gordon Brown announced yesterday,  I think, that people aged 18 or over would be &mdash;</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member come to his question?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  will. It is all well and good to go to North    Carolina to look at initiatives, but there are other  models closer to home in these islands. I do not think that the Minister has  availed himself of or has been pushing those types of models here to try to get  a lot for our young people. Will he be looking at those types of initiative to  try to get a lot of our young people into employment and training?</p>

We have a range of issues to take care  of, and, although the initiative is not aimed specifically and directly at the  target group that the Member referred to, other departmental initiatives are.  Since I came into this job, one of the most concerning issues that we have  faced is the absence of essential skills provision for so many young people who  do not have basic reading, writing and ICT skills. That is one of the scandals  that exist in this country, and it is even more disturbing that so many young  people continue to come out of school in a pipeline into that category.The initiative  is aimed at a particular part of our departmental remit. It is not excluding  groups, because we have initiatives that are focused on young people. In fact,  the Department is carrying out a major piece of work on those young people and  trying to assess how we can improve our performance in that regard.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the Future Jobs Fund, and he has  written to me in that regard. Northern    Ireland has its own initiatives. Over the  past couple of years, I have heard that announcements were made in London about great  initiatives. In many of those cases, they were reannouncing schemes that they  had scrapped a couple of years ago and we had retained or versions of schemes  that we had. Very few of the schemes that have been announced in the past few  years by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which was formerly  the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS), which was  formerly something else, have been new, and very few of them have brought new  money. One will see that those Departments are in retreat with regard to  further and higher education and are cutting substantial sums of money from  higher and further education, for instance, which we have been able to resist  so far.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">We are strongly focused on doing something for that group  of young people, but the initiative being discussed is aimed at improving job  prospects by making it easier and more inviting for indigenous companies to  expand or for foreign direct investment companies to settle here. Although that  is the aim of that particular initiative, I emphasise that it will not be done  to the exclusion of actions that we have taken and will continue to take for  young people who are not in education, training or employment.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his statement, and I commend him on the  energy that he and his Department have put into the new initiative. He  mentioned cross-cutting working between Departments. Can he outline what  co-operation there will be between his Department, DETI and Invest NI to build  on the North Carolina  model?</p>
