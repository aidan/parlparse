   			<p class="B3BodyText">There is an emerging under-representation of Protestants in  some parts of the public sector &mdash; especially in health and education &mdash; and that  must also be tackled. The DUP&rsquo;s motion singles out the public sector. However,  future growth will be in the private sector, where Catholics are less well  represented. People working in areas such as health and education face  voluntary redundancies and are threatened with potential lay-offs as a result  of the review of public administration.</p>
   			<p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say that under-representation of Protestants  in those areas is not serious. However, it would be wrong to single out the  public sector and to exclude under-representation of Catholics in many private  sector areas.</p>
   			<p class="B3BodyText">It is also wrong to suggest that the Equality Commission is  not already working on fair participation in the public sector. That is why the  SDLP is proposing the amendment; I hope that the DUP will accept it and realise  the good work being done by the Equality Commission, instead of occasionally  bashing them. Mr Deputy Speaker, I move the amendment.</p>
