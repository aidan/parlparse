     <p class="B3BodyText">I will repeat what has been discovered in the  considerations and what I have reported: there are no concerns about the  quality of professional performance. We have very good staff throughout our  Health Service, and we should be proud of them. They need, deserve and merit  our support, instead of what I see as constant, almost guerrilla warfare  against the Health Service from some sectors, particularly some parts of the  media. I regret that because it has an effect on morale.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Around 70% of costs in the Health Service are wages. Around  80% of the staff are female and are overwhelmingly low-paid. They do a huge  job, and they do not do it for the money. They do it to provide a service. I  empathise with the sentiments behind Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s remarks.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the second and third amendments. The former  seeks to remove subsections 12 to 18 from clause 6, and the latter seeks to  remove subsections 12 to 14. The issue is whether it would be an offence to  show a dog with a docked tail. As previously explained to the House at  Consideration Stage, the Bill allows for dogs to be shown if the tail is docked  before the ban is enacted. It will be an offence to show a dog if its tail is  docked after the ban is introduced. The Committee has been very clear when it  has said that, if you accept that the cosmetic docking of tails is wrong, it is  also wrong to allow the continuation of events that perpetuate that practice.  Those two amendments seek to do that, as they seek to allow dogs with docked  tails to continue to be shown despite the removal of a docked tail as a  requirement by the Kennel Club.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, amendment No 3 would remove the vitally  important offence of providing false information to a veterinary surgeon in  respect of certification. As I indicated, the Committee&rsquo;s position is that you  cannot ban the cosmetic docking of dogs&rsquo; tails yet allow the showing of dogs  that have been put through that unnecessary elective practice. The Committee is  content that working dogs with legally docked tails can continue to demonstrate  their working ability at dog shows, as the primary objective for docking the  tail is on welfare grounds.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: In the early part of the Member&rsquo;s  statement, he suggested that the Committee has not had the opportunity to  discuss the amendments, so how can he, as Chairperson of the Committee, now say  that the Committee has a view on various aspects?

     <p class="B3BodyText">As indicated, the Committee supported and indeed  strengthened subsections 12 and 14 of clause 6 in Committee during  Consideration Stage. The proposed amendments seek to undo what has been agreed,  and the Committee stands opposed to them.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 4, which is in the name of Mr Beggs, seeks to  allow the showing of a dog whose tail has been damaged and has, unfortunately,  had to be amputated. That was also discussed previously in Committee, and the  Committee agreed that it should continue to be an offence. I make it clear that  the overwhelming majority of breeders and owners value their dogs, and, as has  been pointed out by other Members, they often spend more money on the dogs than  on themselves. However, it is unfortunate that there are a few in society who  would deliberately set two dogs on each other to make a profit, and I have no  doubt that there are those who would deliberately damage a dog&rsquo;s tail so that it  would be surgically removed, in order to make a profit.</p>
-    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Let us be clear</strong>:  the proposed amendment is not limited to mature dogs but incorporates all ages  of a dog from a newborn puppy upwards. How much more likely will be instances  of damage to a pup&rsquo;s tail with the excuse that it was the bitch that damaged it  when the reality is that it was damaged deliberately to secure a higher profit?  The amendment will create a loophole that will allow that heinous act to be  carried out. The Committee did not wish to see that loophole created. Our  priority is to protect the dog from the few who would undertake those actions.  Therefore, I hope that the House will agree with the Committee and oppose this  amendment.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">A key aim of the Bill is to prevent animals suffering  unnecessary pain and distress, and docking a dog&rsquo;s tail for cosmetic reasons  causes unnecessary suffering. It is not done for a dog&rsquo;s welfare. It is done  purely for the sake of appearance. The Bill, as introduced, made it an offence  to show a dog at an event to which members of the public are admitted on  payment of a fee if the dog&rsquo;s tail had been docked on or after these powers  come into force. The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development proposed  an amendment to strengthen that offence and close any loopholes to prevent show  organisers trying to circumvent the legislation by not charging an entry fee. I  was grateful to the Committee, and that amendment has been made to the Bill.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">How time &mdash; just two weeks &mdash; can change things. Trevor  Clarke, a member of the Committee, has put his name to these ridiculous  amendments to clause 6. Amendment Nos 1 and 2 are designed purely to allow  cosmetic docking for show dogs; they are totally unworkable and would be  impossible to police or enforce. Francie Molloy talked about councils enforcing  that. However, they would have a far bigger headache if the amendments are  passed today, as they would allow cosmetic docking to be done on any dog.  Trevor Clarke&rsquo;s aim is to make clause 6 useless and to achieve what he failed  to achieve at Consideration Stage when he tried to have the entire clause voted  out of the Bill.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">If amendment Nos 1 and 2 are made, the effect will be to  negate clause 6, which would leave us in a worse position than before we  introduced the Bill. When the clause is commenced, the current power in the  Welfare of Animals Act 1972 will fall. If amendment Nos 1 and 2 are voted  through, we will no longer have any powers to require pups to be docked before  their eyes open. It will also be totally impossible to enforce the require&shy;ment  that only a veterinary surgeon may undertake the procedure for show dogs.  Amendment No 2 also makes it impossible to certify any exemption for working  dogs. The North of Ireland will become the docking capital of these islands,  which would send out the message that the welfare of dogs here is of no  importance. I cautioned Members that that would be the result when Trevor  Clarke tried to vote down the clause at Consideration Stage, but, of course, he  has ignored that advice. He obviously does not care whether pups or dogs  suffer.</p>

Let us be very clear</strong>: there is no evidence or  justification to support a case for docking dogs&rsquo; tails for the purposes of  showing.

It is also to send out the message that it is perfectly natural for a  show dog to have a tail and that it is, frankly, barbaric to cut off a dog&rsquo;s  tail just for presentation purposes.</p>
