         <p class="B3BodyText">Again, no decision has been made on Knockmore. I will look  at all the information provided to me on Knockmore. I listened to the comments  of Members this evening, and I have no doubt that I will receive more comments  as the process goes on. However, I think it was a mistake to bring both schools  forward together. In my own mind, however, I have separated them, and I will,  as with all development proposals, be able to make a decision on the basis of  the development proposal.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey is quite correct about the viability audit being  brought forward. It was originally planned for post-primary provision. However,  after listening to the debate in the Chamber, and comments from Members and  educationalists, I thought it was quite right and proper to include primary  schools in the audit. For once, you could maybe say that a Minister has  listened. I believe that all those matters can be delivered in the time ahead.  I want the viability audit back with me by December. If development proposals  come forward for Knockmore and Dunmurry, they will be in that time frame.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">However, I cannot turn round to our managing authorities or  the CCMS and say, &ldquo;Stop. Hold any information you have in front of you that  would raise concern about a school, and stop right away.&rdquo; I would much prefer  that they come forward with those proposals and they can be dealt with in the  round.</p>
-        <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Let us be clear</strong>:  there are schools out there that are failing our young people. You can say we  should have intervened six years ago or five years ago. At one stage in the  debate, the board and Department were criticised for acting too quickly, and,  at another stage, we were criticised for acting too late. I think we acted too  late. One reason I brought forward my September statement was to say to the  managing authorities that we cannot delay these decisions any longer. We cannot  allow children to be failed in our schools.</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">The information is there. The boards and CCMS are aware of  it. If they believe that bringing forward a development proposal ahead of the  audit is the right thing to do, I will allow that process to continue.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">I know it is difficult for MLAs. I know it is difficult for  elected representatives dealing with these matters. However, I appeal to you to  go to meetings with parents and representatives informed. My Department will  make available to anyone any relevant information that can be put into the  public domain about any school coming forward because I want an informed debate  out there. I want Members to be able to go into their communities and offer  leadership on these issues. However, I appeal to Members not to defend the  indefensible, regardless of how it arrived or happened. Do not defend the  indefensible. There are schools in our system that need to be taken out of our  system for the benefit of the young people contained within them.</p>
         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. During Mr Craig&rsquo;s speech, a Member  violated something that the Speaker said should not happen, namely, he walked  across the area between you and the person who was addressing you. I ask you to  pass that on to the Speaker to have a look at.</p>
