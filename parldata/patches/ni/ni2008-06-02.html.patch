 		    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key aims of the first-responder system is to get  help to patients as quickly as possible. Ambulance crews aim for a target of  reaching the patient within eight minutes of being dispatched, which is  achieved 70% of the time. Time is of the essence, and the rapid-responder units  will consist of people who have suitable experience. If they live close to the  patient, they could be called and dispatched earlier. The Department is very  keen on that system, which I want to see implemented as quickly as possible.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to introduce two new pieces of legislation that  will help to further reduce the number of attacks on healthcare staff. The  first is provided for in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. That  will allow certain staff to remove those who create nuisance or disturbance  from hospital premises. The second involves the creation of a new criminal law  that will make it a specific offence to assault or impede healthcare workers in  the course of their duties. Draft proposals for that legislation have already  been drawn up, and are currently being considered by the Northern Ireland  Office.</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Can he confirm that the legislation that is  about to be introduced will also ensure the protection of staff who work in  mental-health hospitals, in view of the aggressive behaviour that is sometimes  seen in that sector?</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mrs Bradley makes a pertinent  point. Although the protection of healthcare workers is a reserved matter, I can  confirm that the new legislation will make it a specific offence to assault or  impede healthcare workers in the course of their duties &mdash; that includes all  healthcare workers, wherever they are based.</p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am sorry that Mr Shannon finds  the reply negative, but his question is for the association that is responsible  for providing guide dogs. As I understand it, the Health Service does not fund  the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association; guide dogs are provided on a  voluntary, charitable basis. I understand that the total number of guide dogs  in Northern Ireland  is 90 and that there is a small waiting list of about 25 people who are waiting  for guide dogs. It is a valuable service that the association provides. I will  give the association whatever support I can, but it is the association that  runs and provides the service. If it feels that it needs my support, I am happy  to listen to what it has to say.</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Guide Dogs for the Blind  Association has carried out sterling work in providing the dogs and the  training needed for those who are blind, and it has done that work on an  entirely voluntary basis. I share Jim Shannon&rsquo;s concerns, and would like to put  on record my sincere appreciation for the work that the association does for  people who are blind. What is the Minister doing to ensure that people who are  blind or partially sighted are given every support to achieve their full  potential?</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree with Mrs O&rsquo;Neill. There  is a UK vision strategy that  my Department supports through the eye clinics and eye clinic liaison officers  that work in Northern    Ireland. We continue to improve and support  those. My Department is also pushing forward the physical and sensory  disability strategy for those suffering disabilities. For example, in the Royal Victoria  Hospital in Belfast, there is an eye clinic liaison  officer, an eye help desk, and a low-vision clinic. In the Northern Board there  is similar provision, as there is in Antrim  Area Hospital  and in Causeway Hospital;  we also provide other facilities, such as low-vision clinics in Newtownards, Bangor and Downpatrick.  There is provision, but we can always improve on it. Some 46,000 people suffer  visual impairment, and we must do whatever is feasible to give them the support  that they merit and require. I certainly do that, with the support not just of  the Health Service but also of the Royal National Institute of Blind People and  the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.</p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: A few months ago, I launched a  programme to screen for diabetic retinopathy, as one possible consequence of  diabetes is visual impairment. Other eye conditions are treated as required. It  would be difficult to set targets for a reduction in the number of people who  suffer from visual impairment. However, the Department can devise strong  policies for conditions such as diabetes that can cause sensory deprivation.</p>
