 	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Lignite Mining in North Antrim</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Lignite mining in North   Antrim is a very important issue for many people, as I am sure  other Members who represent the area will agree. It also concerns other parts  of the North, as air pollution from a lignite mine in Ballymoney would affect  all those living in Belfast,  in the east, to those living in Donegal, in the west. It would also affect  parts of Scotland.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">A similar lignite mine to that proposed in North Antrim  created a black triangle in parts of Germany  and the Czech Republic.  In those areas, sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides from lignite-fuelled  power stations have damaged the environment and were linked to the destruction  of vegetation and to genetic mutation in livestock. That was in addition to the  dust and water pollution that was experienced locally.</p>

Given that  lignite releases more carbon dioxide than coal, oil or gas <span style="font-family:Symbol; ">&frac34;</span><em> [Interruption.]</em></p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to raise a point of order. Is there a quorum in  the House?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We do not have a quorum. However, as a vote will not be taken, the  debate may continue.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  The environmental effect would be disastrous. When I saw the effects of a flash  flood in Cushendall this morning and spoke to families who have been devastated  by the damage that it caused, I was provided with a glimpse of how badly  affected communities would be if climate change were not tackled adequately.</p>
