     <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to confer additional rights of audience of certain  solicitors;&rdquo;. &mdash; [The Minister of Justice (Mr Ford).]</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Justice: Amendment No 29 relates to  clause 85, which deals with legal aid. I will also speak to the other  amendments in the group, which seek to introduce powers to extend solicitors&rsquo;  rights of audience in the higher courts in Northern Ireland.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 85 provides for the introduction of a fixed  financial threshold to be applied by the judiciary when granting criminal legal  aid to defendants at the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court and, on appeal, to the County  Court. Although there is currently a means test for criminal legal aid in those  courts, there are no fixed limits. That can lead to disparity in how legal aid  is granted in the courts. It is hoped that the introduction of a fixed  financial limit will help to target legal aid at those who need it most and  make it easier for practitioners to determine whether their clients are likely  to be eligible for legal aid.</p>
