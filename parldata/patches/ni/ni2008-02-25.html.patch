 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I want to assure Mr Robinson and Members that my first priority is the  provision of social and affordable housing &mdash; and, within that context, the need  to increase the supply of social and affordable housing to address the clearly  identified need, namely the 38,000 people on the waiting list, people who are  homeless, and those with significant savings and who have so far been unable to  get on the first rung of the property ladder. I will be addressing those issues  in more detail in my statement tomorrow. With the bedding down of the political  institutions, however, there is now a need to move ahead and try to live  together as part of housing schemes.</p>

+	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr F McCann </strong>asked the Minister for  Social Development to detail the assessment that she has made of the effect of  her proposals for unrestricted development of houses in multiple occupation, on  the resident communities in Andersonstown    Road, Falls Road and Springfield Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2226/08> (AQO 2226/08)</a></p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>: Although my Department is responsible for the legislation  relating to houses in multiple occupation,  the &lsquo;Houses in Multiple Occupancy: Subject Plan for Belfast City Council  Area 2015: Draft Plan 2006&rsquo;, which sets out the restrictions, or lack of  restrictions, is the responsibility of the Minister of the Environment. As Mr  McCann is a Member of the Committee for Social Development, I am sure that he  will appreciate that distinction.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The development of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) on  the roads specified in the question will help to regenerate the area and help  to meet local needs for shared and affordable accommodation. The 10%  restriction on all other streets will protect traditional residential areas.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Initially, the proposals were being championed by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor  under direct rule. However, the Minister was in west Belfast a few weeks ago and would have seen  at first hand the severe social deprivation in the area. Not one community  organisation, including the West Belfast Partnership Board, supports the  introduction of HMOs in the area. Will the Minister say why she intends to  pursue the policy when there is no support in the area for such developments,  which could lead to the demise of close-knit communities as we have witnessed  in other parts of Belfast.</p>
