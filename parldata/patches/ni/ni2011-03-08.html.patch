     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Today, I am reminded of why we are  discussing the transition of powers to local authorities. After the Macrory  report and the 1973 reform of local government, those powers were taken away  from local authorities because they had been abused. In any normal society, it  is accepted as the norm that local councils &mdash; parish councils, district  councils or whatever they are in other western democracies &mdash; deal with planning  and have various other powers. As we well know, however, the North is not the  norm.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge for us as politicians is to move to a society  in which local politicians reflect the community and perform their duties and  functions in a role of absolute commitment to equality, transparency and to the  removal of the barriers to exclusion. As the Committee scrutinised the Bill,  usually in the Senate Chamber, it became increasingly apparent that the Bill  had been rushed through and was out of sequence. The document on the reform of  local government is merely out for consultation at the moment. That reform must  be in place before the Bill in order that &mdash;</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I thank the Member for setting the context for the debate.  I would like you now to address the amendments in this group, please.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: I appreciate your  guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker and, indeed, your forbearance. However, without one  reform setting the context, we will get the other reform absolutely wrong. If  the Planning Bill is dealt with outside the context of the reform of local  government, the issues to which I referred &mdash; the lack of transparency, openness  and equality and the failure to protect against discrimination &mdash; will be  repeated. Those were pivotal to the errors of the past, and that is why I set  the context.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP broadly supports the first group of amendments. I  have no intention of going through each amendment individually. Mr Kinahan  highlighted the issue of well-being in amendment No 2. It is important for that  term to be defined. I hope that, as part of local government reform, it will be  defined.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I, like the Chairperson of the Environment Committee, sat  through an important inquiry by that Committee into climate change. Therefore,  I welcome amendment No 6, which requires councils to take into account the  &ldquo;potential impact of climate change&rdquo; when conducting surveys of their district.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 15 provides for the independent examiner to be  appointed by the Department. I welcome the recognition by the Department that  the independence of that examiner is pivotal and must be beyond reproach.  Therefore, the Department was asked by the Committee to tighten up the  conditions under which that independent examiner might be appointed, and the  amendment is welcomed accordingly.</p>

 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister of the Environment:</span> The amendments in this group are technical. They include textual amendments to  ensure a consistent approach throughout the Bill, typographical corrections,  updating amendments and amendments prompted by comments from the Examiner of  Statutory Rules. These amendments do not involve any change in policy and have  been supported by the Committee. Therefore, I do not wish to prolong the debate  by commenting on each amendment individually, but I will highlight key  amendments.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 174 allows a council to deal with the enforcement of  advertisement control. Clause 174(3) re-enacts article 84 of the Planning (Northern Ireland)  Order 1991 and contains defences where an advertisement is displayed in  contravention of the advertisement regulations. Those defences have been  amended by clause 37 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill as  introduced. That clause provides that anyone displaying an advertisement in  contravention of the regulations will not now be guilty of an offence if the  advertisement was displayed without their knowledge, and they took all  reasonable steps to prevent the display or to remove the advertisement after  the display. It is anticipated that clause 37 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and  Environment Bill will be brought into operation in advance of the Planning  Bill. By the time that the Planning Bill is in operation, article 84 of the  Planning Order will have been amended. Therefore, clause 174 needs to be  amended to reflect amended article 84. Amendment No 61 provides that amendment.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 202 sets out the procedure for the Planning Appeals  Commission. The Examiner of Statutory Rules commented that the rules made by  OFMDFM under clause 202(5) are subject to no Assembly procedure. Amendment No  68 applies the negative resolution Assembly control.</p>
