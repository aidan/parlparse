     <p class="B3BodyText">There are three groups of amendments, and we will debate  the amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendment Nos  1 to 7 and 10 to 16, which deal with police and judicial powers in respect of  closure orders. The second debate will be on amendment Nos 8, 9, 27 and 30,  which deal with restrictions on the promotion and pricing of alcohol. The third  debate will be on amendment Nos 17 to 26, 28 and 29, which deal with late  licences, young people&rsquo;s attendance in clubs, accounting offences and the  restrictions on registered clubs in respect of advertising functions.</p>

The Questions on stand  part will be taken at the appropriate points in the Bill. If that is clear, we  shall proceed.</p>
