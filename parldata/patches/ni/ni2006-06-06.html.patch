 				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. In the light of the answers that you have  given to other Members, am I correct in understanding that the sooner we can  restore ourselves to a fully working Assembly, the sooner the kind of idle  comments that have been made, particularly about the need for injury time &mdash;  surely, we are already well into injury time &mdash; and the long-suffering  electorate of Northern Ireland&mdash;</p>
 				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Order. With due respect, Dr Farren, take your seat. The Speaker is standing.  That is not a point of order, salient as your comments may be.</p>

It  is up to every Member and every party to make their own decisions about what  they do. Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly stated its position, here and elsewhere.</p>
