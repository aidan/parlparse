 	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we see from media  reports, evidence of man-made contributions to climate change is  everywhere &mdash; the scientific evidence is  overwhelming. Average worldwide temperatures have risen by more than  0&middot;6&deg;C in the past century. Around the North, sea levels are rising to the  extent that they are now about 10 cm higher than they were in 1990.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">If there is a failure to  act, the consequences of climate change will be devastating locally and  catastrophic globally. Sustainable  development and combating climate change are not merely about meeting  global commit&shy;ments but about ensuring that a viable planet remains for future  generations &mdash; a point that Mr Wilson made most articulately. Therefore, the  Government must ensure that the concepts that I have outlined are deeply  enshrined in policy-making, and the best way for that to be done is through the  Programme for Government.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">To date, the  Committee&rsquo;s engagement with OFMDFM has focused on work to produce a set  of sustainable development indicators. I will concentrate my remarks on those  indicators, because the Executive will use them when they report publicly on  progress towards sustainable development in Northern Ireland.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the proposal to produce a clear set  of indicators that will enable actions to be monitored  and information to be made widely available on how good, or not,  progress is towards the targets. Many of the proposed indicators will  facilitate a comparison with the indicators used to measure sustainable  development in the UK.  That will enable any progress to be  benchmarked against that of the UK.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The wide range of indicators covers areas such as:  community relations; economic well-being; the sustainability  of rural communities; the amount of waste sent to landfill sites; water consumption; greenhouse gas  emissions; air quality; and biodiversity. That holistic approach, which  reflects the fact that sustainable development is about more than purely  environmental issues and concerns, is appropriate and necessary. That is backed  up by the fact that OFMDFM, rather than the Department  of the Environment, now has responsibility to support the strategic  oversight of the implementation of the strategy.</p>
