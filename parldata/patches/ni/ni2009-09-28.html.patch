He has been lobbied, in particular, by Clady Primary School,  which faced adverse conditions last year.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows that farmers are already involved, through  contracts, to clear snow from roads. We examined whether that work could be  built on to include salting and gritting. However, the matter was not pursued  for a number of reasons. First, it would significantly increase the amount of  salting and, therefore, the cost of the operation. Salting done in a piecemeal  way is less efficient and more expensive than using large-capacity gritters.  Secondly, there are problems of command and control, of contacting all the  farmers and telling them when to grit. There is also the likelihood of  discontinuous treatment, with roads being salted for several miles but the  treatment discontinued without any warning to the motorist. We would have to  rely on people contracted to come out and to be available.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">All those factors led us to conclude that the work is  better done by Roads Service. Farmers will continue to be involved in  snow-clearance operations wherever such conditions pertain. As I have said, we  explored the option with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  (DARD).</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Kind words from the Fianna F&aacute;il Finance Minister will not  reassure me. I am surprised that they reassure Sammy Wilson. We are looking at  a Government that will, more than likely, go from power if a general election  is called. As a republican, reassurances from a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister do not go  too far. We must ensure that we have structures around the NAMA proposals if  they are passed by the D&aacute;il, and there is no guarantee that they will be  passed.</p>
