     <p class="B3BodyText">I feel that issues still have to be resolved. The  continuing attacks on the PSNI are an absolutely fundamental issue, and we have  to address them today. The reforms of the PSNI over the years and the equality  work that has been done by the organisation should be very much commended.  Tribute has to be paid in that regard. Public confidence is increasing, with  94% of people saying in 2008 that they felt safe in their communities. However,  it is unlikely that a similar poll of police officers and their families would  yield the same results.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The threat from dissident republicans made it into a July  2011 Home Office report outlining a UK counterterrorism strategy.  Attacks on police officers are becoming far too regular an occurrence. Those  people keep our communities safe. It is thanks in no small part to their  tireless work that we are now enjoying relative peace and stability in the  Province; therefore any attempts on the lives of officers must be  wholeheartedly and unreservedly condemned.</p>
