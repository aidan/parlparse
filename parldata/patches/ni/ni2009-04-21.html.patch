       <p class="B3BodyText">We have made an excellent start to building closer  relations with Europe. We have a comprehensive  Commission stock-take analysis on the extent and depth of our European relations  and a high-level overarching strategy for European engagement to guide us. For  the first time, we have a set of collective European policy and programme  priorities and a mechanism whereby Europe is  mainstreamed in Departments&rsquo; strategic and financial planning processes. The  publication of the Executive&rsquo;s &lsquo;Priorities for European Engagement: Action Plan  2008-2009&rsquo; marks a step change in our relations with the European Union.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">As the Barroso Commission draws to a close, we will work  hard to maintain and enhance our profile in Brussels. We will ensure that we have a  strong platform from which to launch future political engagement with a new  college of commissioners and the European Parliament. Our engagement will be  ambitious, innovative and strategic.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, the First Minister and I are grateful to  Ministers and to Members of the Assembly for their support. We will, naturally,  update the Assembly on further developments as appropriate.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">What changes, if any, did the Executive make to reflect the  concerns that were raised by the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister in its response to the Department on the Executive&rsquo;s  action plan and those reflected by other Statutory Committees? My Committee  sent its response to the Department. How will OFMDFM ensure that it fulfils its  role as the co-ordinating body that oversees the work not only of its own  Department but of the other Northern Ireland Departments in its response to the  task force report and implementation? What benchmarks are the First Minister and  deputy First Minister putting down to measure the imple&shy;mentation of the task  force report and its practical outworkings for the Northern Ireland economy?</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister will be aware of objective 7 in  the task force report, which is designed to record and share the experience of  peace building and conflict resolution in Northern Ireland. OFMDFM is the  lead Department in developing proposals for international research into peace  building, and, although there are indications that the Department is bringing  that forward, no timetable has yet been provided. Is the deputy First Minister  in a position to indicate a timescale for all that important work?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Chairperson of the Committee asked several questions. The  role of junior Ministers will be critical. They will be charged with the  responsibility to take that forward, under our tutelage, of course. The  Executive and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister will  be concerned about ensuring that benchmarks are put in place that accurately  reflect the progress that has been made over the period.</p>
