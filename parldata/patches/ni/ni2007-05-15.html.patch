 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Specialist beds are required for different conditions.  Members talked about the particular needs of carers &mdash; for example, those who  care for people with autism and other learning disabilities. Although there is  a need for inpatient services and treatment  intervention, respite for carers is needed also. When the Minister is  looking at the provision of services, I trust that he will look across the  whole of Northern Ireland  and, in particular, to the region west of the Bann. Parents who may have other  children, and other caring responsibilities, should not have to trek across to Belfast on a regular  basis to visit their children.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined clearly a number of actions that he  is already taking. In fairness, and given that the Health Service is complex,  he does seem to be hitting the ground running, and I congratulate him.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, perhaps he will confirm that one of the key  recommendations of the Bamford Report was that a study of the mental-health needs of children in Northern Ireland should be commissioned. That is long overdue, and  indeed some work and a report were to have been completed by 2000. Planning to  meet needs must start from a baseline, and I ask the Minister to ensure that commissioning  that study will be one of the key actions he will take on board quickly.  I trust that he will report progress to the Assembly at the earliest  opportunity, and well within the year.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member who spoke in the debate has pointed out the  lack of attention that has been given to services for children and young people. There has certainly been a lack  of coherent planning and investment.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our higher levels of deprivation have also been mentioned, and the legacy of 30 years of political  conflict on mental health and emotional well-being has not yet been  fully realised. Child and adolescent mental health services are wholly inadequate and have resulted in some of the  cases that Sue Ramsey mentioned earlier. The difficulty  is that young people and their families wait for months and sometimes  years for appropriate treatment.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have learned that young people are now being transported  to England  for treatment, with no regard being given to the social disconnection and  distress that that causes them and their families.</p>
