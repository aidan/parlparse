 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>: This is yet another example of a motion  proposing objectives that have not been properly costed. The Assembly cannot  insert proper healthcare into some bill of rights without saying how we shall pay for it. The motion is also  subjective, because what is &ldquo;proper healthcare&rdquo;? It must be defined. One  man&rsquo;s &ldquo;proper healthcare&rdquo; may not be another&rsquo;s. Everyone wants the best  healthcare for everyone; no one can question  my commitment to that aim after years of defending and extending  patients&rsquo; rights. However, putting proposals  to the Assembly without costing them properly  or saying from where the money will come does nobody any favours. In fact, it could lead to a great deal of embarrassment. Such proposals raise hopes that  could be dashed for lack of available finance.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an ongoing examination of the situation, so let us  reactivate or properly cost rural proofing as the Assembly envisaged back in  2002. This time, however, let us ensure that the civil servants implement rural  proofing and that all Departments conform  to Assembly policy. Let us use the machinery that we already have at our  disposal to look after the rural population. We must stop talking about it and  get on with the job.</p>

+		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&bull; equal access to life-saving  services for all, irrespective of postcode;&rdquo;</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to speak to  my amendment. I also thank the two Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs for tabling this motion so  soon. The issue is close to my heart and important for us all.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board what Bob Coulter has said, but I cannot accept his amendment, because it is too  specific. I have worked on the rural medicine working group, and,  although its work is to be commended, it does not look at maternity,  paediatric, surgical or accident and emergency services. The working group  focuses primarily on medical services for coronaries, pneumonia and so on. Its  remit is not wide enough. I have asked it to widen its scope and to look at  other issues that affect people in all areas, not just in rural areas.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Health provision &mdash; or the lack of it &mdash; in rural areas is  extremely important to Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s large rural communities. Equity and equality across Northern Ireland  is what this Assembly is all about, and that must also apply to healthcare provision. The Department of Health and  Social Services&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fit for the Future&rsquo; paper from 1998 cites equity as the  first principle of healthcare delivery. In 2002, the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s Investing for Health strategy proposed to  reduce health inequalities.</p>
