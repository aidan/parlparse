       <p class="H5StageHeading">Ambulance Service: Western Health and Social Care Trust</p>
       <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of the proposed cuts to ambulance hours in the Western Health  and Social Care Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  188/10<a name="AQO18810"></a>)</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: There is no proposed cut to  Ambulance Service cover in the Western Health and Social Care Trust area. Under  the Ambulance Service&rsquo;s plans, there will be a net increase of nearly 4,500  hours of paramedic cover. That will be achieved by replacing 13,500 hours of  A&amp;E ambulance cover with over 18,000 hours of rapid response paramedic  cover. My assessment of the proposals is that emergency response times in the  Western Trust area will continue to improve, and that those patients most in  need will get faster pre-hospital emergency care.</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ramsey</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that a recent BBC report showed that in England &mdash; or Britain &mdash; in over 91% of calls in  which a rapid response vehicle was sent out, an ambulance was sent out also? In  light of that, can the Minister tell me the number of rapid response vehicles  that were sent to emergencies in which an ambulance was also required because  the rapid response paramedic could not provide adequate cover in that  emergency?</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: We covered that issue on a  number of occasions. When a rapid-response vehicle is dispatched, an ambulance  is dispatched at the same time. In about 90% of cases, the ambulance is  required, but the rapid-response vehicle arrives at the scene first, which  means that the paramedic gets to the patient faster. In 10% of cases, the  ambulance, which carries a paramedic and a medical technician, can turn back  because its presence is not necessary.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">There is a fully trained paramedic in both the  rapid-response vehicle and the ambulance. Although a rapid-response vehicle can  respond more quickly than an ambulance, the two are very similar and can  provide the same treatment. However, an ambulance carries a stretcher, a chair  and a spine board. Therefore, the figures that the Member read out for England are  entirely consistent with what we would expect.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The performance of the Ambulance Service over the past five  years, particularly its performance in the Western Trust area, shows a marked  improvement in response times.</p>
