There are  no convincing arguments why two separate and costly bureaucratic systems are  required. A single management tier would be more efficient.

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill passed its Second Stage on 1 July and was referred  to the Committee on 2 July. As Members know, it is a major piece of legislation  that contains 35 clauses and seven schedules. It deals with the restructuring  and reorganisation of the health and social care system.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to the introduction of the Bill, the Committee heard  evidence from several key organisations that were likely to be directly  affected by the proposals as they stood. Those organisations included the  Health Promotion Agency (HPA) and the Mental Health Commission (MHC), both of  which will cease to exist when the new structures come into operation. The  Committee also heard from the Institute   of Public Health in  Ireland (IPH) and the Northern Ireland Local Government Association (NILGA).</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the introduction of the Bill, a total of 30  organisations responded to the Committee&rsquo;s request for written evidence. The  Committee considered all those written submissions and took further evidence  from other key organisations. It heard from the health and social services  boards and the health and social services councils, which will also cease to  exist in their current format following the changes.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 33 means that health and social care bodies  must have due regard to comments received from the patient and client council. In  essence, that means that a sound reason must be provided for not accepting  advice provided by the patient and client council. Similarly, amendment No 34  will give greater force to the requirement for health and social care bodies to  have due regard to comments received in response to their consultation schemes.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, amendment No 45 means that the consideration stage  of grievance procedures following the transfer of staff must not involve  transferor bodies, which are the bodies from which the persons are transferred.  That provision was not included in the Bill, since it was thought that all such  bodies would cease to be in existence after 2009. However, it is likely that  transfers from one body to another under the Bill will be possible after April  2009. Those transfers are likely to involve the phased implementation of the  functions in relation to shared services, and it is therefore appropriate to  include a reference to transferor bodies.</p>

Uncertainty  about the relationship between the various bodies, and particularly the  regional board and the regional agency, has been a recurring theme of the  written submissions that the Committee received. The Committee accepts that, to  some extent, those concerns may be addressed in a framework document to be  drawn up under clause 5.

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The capital Budget for each year in Northern Ireland  is a limited, fixed amount. However, we now have, though the pre-Budget report,  a degree of flexibility to accelerate some &pound;86&middot;5 million of capital investment  in the local economy over the next two years. We will be looking at that  carefully. Most large construction projects have a large lead-in time, and it  is not always easy to bring them forward. However, the Strategic Investment  Board, Departments and I are working hard to identify specific infrastructure  projects that can be brought forward in the current climate.</p>

-	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. Mr Durkan ask the Minister of Finance and  Personnel what is his current estimate of the cost of the equal pay issue in  the Civil Service (i) in this financial year; and (ii) in each of the next two  financial years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQ01399/09> (AQO 1399/09)</a></p>
+	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Durkan</strong> ask the Minister of Finance and  Personnel what is his current estimate of the cost of the equal pay issue in  the Civil Service (i) in this financial year; and (ii) in each of the next two  financial years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQ01399/09> (AQO 1399/09)</a></p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Resolution of the equal pay claim could have a  significant implication for the Northern Ireland Civil Service pay bill. The  extent of the financial implications will, ultimately, depend on the outcome of  discussions between officials and the trade unions and on the approach approved  by the Executive. Details of any potential settlement will be progressed over  the coming period, and exact figures will not be available until that process  has concluded, as I am sure the Member understands. However, as I made clear in  the September monitoring statement, the one-off payment to staff could cost in excess  of &pound;100 million, although Members will appreciate that that figure will depend  on a broad range of factors that we are in the process of considering.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: I thank the Minister for his answer. I  appreciate that, in circumstances where negotiations with the unions are  ongoing &mdash; and, I assume, ongoing negotiations at another level with the  Treasury &mdash; his answer must be a limited one.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, prior to  devolution, some of us asked the civil servants who were briefing the  Committee on the Preparation of Government whether there were public pay issues  or public-sector pension issues that might hit the Executive over the head and  of which we needed to be aware. We were told that there was nothing there. It  seems, however, that that issue was apparent to the Civil Service at the time  and should have been flagged up. It was known about in the early days of  devolution, but it was not addressed in January&rsquo;s Budget statement to this  House.</p>

+	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have three areas  of concern: funding, parental involvement in education and  primary-education strategy in East Belfast.  Education funding has dominated the headlines over the past months, and only  slow progress is being made. Primary-school education is the most important  period of learning for children, when they develop many of the skills that they  will use later in life. However, there are strong feelings that many children  are being failed at primary level, at least in part due to the lack of funding  for teaching activities.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has one of the greatest disparities of  funding between primary and post-primary education. The Minister promised to  reduce that funding disparity; however, that is not seen to be the case. In the  academic year 2007-08, the disparity of funding was &pound;1,244&middot;29 per pupil; in the  academic year 2008-09, that disparity stands at &pound;1,258&middot;34. That confirms that  the funding disparity is increasing, even though, on 21 April 2008, the  Minister promised the House that she wanted social justice, fairness and  equality for all children. How can there be equality for all children when  those in primary education are not receiving enough funding to ensure appropriate  levels of education? Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us about how she plans  to deal with that issue.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently met representatives from the East Belfast  Principals&rsquo; Group, who raised issues that confirmed how far they had to stretch  their budgets in an attempt to meet the education standards required for our  children. One issue is some schools&rsquo; inability to employ an IT technician to  maintain computers, with schools having to share a technician to spread the  cost, and the disadvantage that that brings. In today&rsquo;s society, where the  ability to use a computer effectively is essential, that situation is  unacceptable.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The principals&rsquo; group is concerned about insufficient funding  being made available for special needs education. That support is essential for  children suffering from learning difficulties in order to prepare them to lead  a successful life in the future. However, 10 primary schools in East Belfast have reduced their special needs budget; two  primary-schools&rsquo; budgets remained the same; and a further two primary schools  had no budget for special needs education. Educational disparity matters, and  the Assembly wants, and needs, to place greater importance on pupils who are  underachieving in our education system in order to improve their social  mobility.</p>
