     <p class="H4StageHeading">Volcanic Ash Cloud</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice of a question for urgent oral  answer under Standing Order 20A to the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McDevitt asked the First Minister and deputy First  Minister how many people from Northern Ireland are believed to be stranded  abroad as a result of the volcanic ash cloud over Europe; what liaison they  have had with the British and Irish Governments and the air traffic control  authorities on this issue; and what arrangements are being made to assist local  people to get home.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: I understand that this afternoon&rsquo;s reports  suggest that there is evidence that the volcano has subsided and that ash is no  longer feeding into the weather system. We hope that, if that position  continues, airspace may start to open tomorrow.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">We are extremely sympathetic to the plight of those who are  currently affected by the travel chaos caused by the volcanic ash cloud,  particularly those who are stranded abroad. Since the first information on the  volcanic ash plume became available on Wednesday 14 April, we have continued to  monitor reports from the Met Office and to liaise with other Departments and  agencies here, as well as with our counterparts in Britain  and Ireland,  to monitor the potential impacts on public health and the environment.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">A range of information specific to the volcanic ash was  available on the NI Direct website from early on Thursday 15 April, including  links to airports and advice on the implications from a health perspective.  That provided the main points of contact in one place. That information was  also issued via the social media platforms Twitter and Facebook. As the  situation developed, the information was updated and supplemented with details  about passenger rights and travel insurance. That is updated as the situation  develops.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">Peak services for Stena Line have been fully booked as  passengers divert to surface routes, but there is generally up to 50% spare  capacity on overnight sailings. There is still some spare capacity on the Larne  routes, but Norfolkline is fully booked until Thursday 22 April. Translink is  also working closely with ferry services P&amp;O and Stena Line to meet the  demand coming off the ferries at Larne harbour and Belfast. We shall continue to work closely  with transport providers to ensure that additional demand on ferry, bus and  rail services can be accommodated.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I join the deputy First Minister in welcoming any good news with regard to the  situation at the volcano itself. Can the First Minister and deputy First  Minister tell us specifically how many of our neighbours are stranded abroad?  Do the Ministers understand, as many of us do in this House, that very many of  those who are caught abroad are young, vulnerable schoolchildren? Some of them  will be running out of money and medication. What specific steps, at a devolved  Administration level, are the Ministers going to take to make sure that those  people have the means to get home? Some of them may now find themselves in very  critical situations indeed.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName">The deputy First Minister: We are conscious of the  difficulties faced by the many people who have found themselves stranded as a  result of this phenomenal development, particularly those who do not have at  their disposal the means to ensure that they could travel by alternative ways.  It is too early to say how many people are directly involved, because we all  know that that is a fairly massive task. Figures are being collated, and, on  completion, they will be supplied to COBRA. Given that we are facing a more  optimistic situation, with the prospect of airways being open within the next  24 to 48 hours, if the subsidence continues, the task will turn to the expenses  that people have incurred as a result of their prolonged stays. That raises all  sorts of questions that will have to receive some consideration, not least by  insurance companies, airlines and Administrations. Whether anything can be done  to assist those people is something that will have to be explored.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr <span class="BoldText">Kennedy)</span>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to ask the deputy First Minister a question  on this important issue. I welcome his earlier comments and the indication that  it appears that progress will be possible in the coming hours. Is there any  estimation as to what the shutdown of flights at airports is costing the Northern Ireland  economy? Has an assessment been made of the number of people who are stranded  in Northern Ireland  and unable to return to other venues? Will the deputy First Minister assure the  House that regular updates to Members of the House, members of the OFMDFM  Committee and, most importantly, the public, will be provided as quickly as  accurate information becomes available?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName">The deputy First Minister: On behalf of OFMDFM, I give  the commitment that we will endeavour to keep people as fully informed as  possible as things develop, and we will continue to maintain contact with the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Information on the number of people who have found  themselves stranded here is also being collated. There are people from  different parts of the world stranded here. Those from European destinations  have endeavoured to use the seas to get back to the continent, by travelling  through England, Scotland or Wales, but it is too soon to say  what the exact figures are. We will make those numbers available when they have  been established. All of that will become superfluous if, as is expected, the  hopeful news that we received in the past short while that the volcano has  ceased, for the moment, comes to pass. If the airways are open within 24 to 48  hours, we must ensure that the obvious resultant demand will be met as quickly  as possible.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">All of that is important, and we understand that information  is the key ingredient, particularly at a time like this. People detest nothing  more than being in the dark and not knowing how they are fixed. Some of us  heard the complaints that were aired on the radio this morning about the  situation in Barcelona, where it has been suggested that people who were on an  Aer Lingus flight from Dublin were being provided with assistance and  information, while people who were on an Aer Lingus flight out of Belfast  believed that they were being treated differently. I spoke to Miche&aacute;l Martin  today about that issue, and he has undertaken to raise it with the Aer Lingus  authorities, as we have done.</p>
