           <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of the downturn is already biting deep, and it  is difficult to predict how long it will last. Although no specific elements or  measures in the package come under the banner of the Health Department, it is  universally recognised that people&rsquo;s state of health and, often, their mental  well-being are directly affected by many of the issues being discussed today,  such as fuel poverty, social disadvantage, exclusion, unemployment and  redundancy. Therefore, it is no accident that promoting health and well-being  is one of the key priorities in the Programme for Government and that about  half of the Assembly&rsquo;s public funding goes on health, social services and  public safety.</p>
           <p class="B3BodyText">The effects of the economic crisis can be worse for people  who are already on low incomes. At this time of year, we are all familiar with  campaigns that warn about the effect of cold weather, particularly on  vulnerable older people, young children and people of any age who have a  serious or long-term medical condition.</p>
           <p class="B3BodyText">It is a fact that many more people die during the winter  than in summer due to the effects of cold weather. During severe winters, the  number who die increases greatly due to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory  illnesses that are brought on by a drop in body temperature. A report published  today by the Institute of Public Health in Ireland warns of an increase in  winter deaths due to an increase in fuel poverty.</p>
