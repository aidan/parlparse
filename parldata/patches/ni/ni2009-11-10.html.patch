       <p class="B3BodyText">Those are some broader reasons why we will oppose the  Question that clause 2 stand part of the Bill. We recognise the areas in which  the First Minister has stretched himself and demonstrated good leadership and  good authority. We do not like the terms of the devolution of justice; we  believe that they are substan&shy;tially, if not exclusively, in the image of the  DUP&rsquo;s needs. We again warn the British Government that unpicking the  institutions and elements that have created cohesion and stability in our  society &mdash; the Good Friday Agreement provisions, the parades provisions and the  Patten provisions &mdash; as part of a broader approach and strategy is not the way  to deepen stability. However, that is what clause 2 does.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister may be looking to the unionist community  and perhaps particular elements of it to decide what to do next. The bravest  step that he could take would be to say that we need devolution of justice now,  because it will deepen confidence in our institutions and deal with the issues  that affect so many unionist and nationalist communities that are at risk. He  should go further and define the new order of things and differentiate it from  the fog that surrounded the previous months and weeks and all the difficulties  with a shared future, the workings of the North/South institutions and other  unresolved issues in government. The DUP should say that it will clear all that  fog. It should also say that nationalism has an entitlement under the  provisions of democratic inclusion. Further&shy;more, if that party insists on the  cross-community support mechanism for the selection of a justice Minister, the  SDLP candidate should be endorsed.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">I will refer to the first group of amendments and mention  briefly the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill. The Committee received a pre-introductory briefing  from departmental officials on 9 September 2009. A public notice was placed in  the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; and the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; on 18 September  2009 seeking written evidence on the Bill.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill was referred to the Committee on completion of its  Second Stage on 22 September 2009, and, in response to its call for evidence,  the Committee received written submissions from the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee and a late submission from Mr Jim Allister QC, leader of  Traditional Unionist Voice. The Committee considered the Bill and the  submission from the Assembly and Executive Review Committee on 7 October 2009.  We discussed and noted the late written submission from Mr Jim Allister QC on  14 October 2009 and agreed to include that submission in the Committee&rsquo;s  report.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee undertook its formal clause-by-clause  scrutiny of the Bill on 14 October 2009. I will now relate the outcome of that  scrutiny. The Committee agreed that it was content with clause 1 and the relevant  schedule as drafted. The Committee considered clause 2, and Mr Elliott proposed  that the Committee seek advice from the Assembly&rsquo;s Legal Services about the  potential consequences of the sunset clause. The Committee divided on Mr  Elliott&rsquo;s proposal, which fell. Mr Attwood proposed to leave out clause 2; the  Committee divided on Mr Attwood&rsquo;s proposal, which also fell. The Question was  put that the Committee was content with clause 2 as drafted; the Committee  divided on the Question, which was agreed.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member recognise that, with respect to size of  mandates, it is commonplace around the world for parties that are smaller than  the Alliance Party in terms of seats in the legislature and support in elections  to be in government legitimately? South of the border, there is the recent  example of the Progressive Democrats and, at present, the Green Party, both of  which have proportionately smaller mandates than the Alliance Party but play a  full and active part in voluntary coalition Governments.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member has made a very valid point. In other democracies not too far from  here, where coalition Governments are the norm, parties very much smaller than  the Alliance Party regularly form part of the Government and regularly punch  well above their weight.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I say to Mr Kennedy that this is not a point about one  particular party; it is about having a system in place that commands community  support. Obviously, we on these Benches are keen to ensure that there is  unionist confidence in any system that appoints a Minister of justice. I ask Mr  Kennedy and his party to reflect again on how any of the other available  systems could command cross-community support.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">If the SDLP were to achieve the post of Minister of justice  using the d&rsquo;Hondt system, it would mean that that Minister would command less  than 15% of the support of the Assembly. It would also depend on a SDLP  Minister being able to gain the support of all of his or her colleagues, and  that is unlikely. There is a requirement in the Department of Justice Bill for  the person selected as Minister of justice to have the support of more than 50%  of both sections of the community through the designation system.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  That is absolutely correct. Perhaps it would be better for the SDLP to wait  until its leadership contest is decided before it nominates someone as Minister  of justice.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The issues that will be dealt with by a future Minister of  justice are so sensitive that a higher threshold for the post is required.  Therefore, to subject the post to the vagaries of the d&rsquo;Hondt process, as the  UUP would do, despite acknowledging those sensitivities, which, I think, they  now do, is something that they need to reflect on. Opposing for the sake of  opposing or doing so for spurious reasons such as timing &mdash; there are no timings  involved, which will be demonstrated when the second set of amendments is  proposed &mdash; is wrong. The UUP must reflect on its opposition, which is not  particularly principled, is entirely manufactured, and does not represent the  position that it has espoused in recent times or indeed that has been espoused  by the wider unionist community.</p>
