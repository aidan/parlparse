     <p class="B3BodyText">I urge all Departments to source and fund programmes based  on outcomes. John McCallister talked about that earlier. Departments should not  axe a service in a budget line item in order to come up with the right figures.  Like other MLAs, I have watched as funding for small, relatively inexpensive  programmes with very high impact disappear while funding for larger, more  questionable, programming is preserved.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Preventative spending, which was touched upon by other  Members, will be key over the life of this Budget. Many of the programmes now  facing closure offer incredible value for money by preventing expensive health  and social security crises later. I strongly urge Ministers to look at the real  outcomes of the projects and programmes that they support and to work together  to ensure that they are not blindly chopping off organisations&rsquo; funding and  thus damaging their ability to function and deliver services.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the upside is that the economic crisis will force  us to look seriously at the financial cost of division and the duplication of  services and at the financial consequences of not directing sufficient  resources towards community relations. Economic growth and job creation will be  critical over the next few years. That cannot happen without serious investment  in a shared future. Without a real and resourced cohesion, sharing and  integration (CSI) strategy to tackle the divisions in our society and a clear  understanding of the role that poverty plays in feeding and sustaining those  divisions, we will not be able to attract the outside investment that we would  like.    </p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName">We will not achieve and maintain the stability that is  required to embed and expand economic growth and, ultimately, to shift  resources away from the very expensive results of sectarianism &mdash; in policing,  housing, justice and other large cost-agency responses &mdash; towards sustaining  prevention and equality of opportunity. Continuing division makes investment  difficult and drives the best and most successful and talented members of our  communities away.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">I encourage the Executive to think through genuinely what  they are offering the people of Northern    Ireland. What kind of society is really on  offer through this draft Budget? What prospects for employment and economic  recovery are here? What do we really expect to happen to those on whom welfare  reform will impact?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am acutely aware of the fact that is  has been a long 24 hours for very many of us, but I am not going to promise  brevity if I cannot be sure of delivering it.</p>
