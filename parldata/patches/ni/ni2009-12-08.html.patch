       <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed to hold its next meeting in language  sectoral format on a date to be agreed in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute;  m&eacute; s&aacute;sta gur th&aacute;inig an d&aacute; Rialtas le ch&eacute;ile chun an t-&aacute;bhar seo a phl&eacute;.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Why did he not refer to  the development of an indigenous language strategy, both for the Irish language  and Ulster-Scots, given that he is scheduled to brief the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure on Thursday and that he has still not submitted a  paper to the Executive, not even on a strategy or on high-level principles that  might guide a strategy? Was the language strategy discussed at the meeting that  he attended? If not, when does the Minister intend to consult with Foras na  Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency on a draft strategy? Furthermore, when does  the Minister expect the Ulster-Scots Agency to improve its corporate governance  arrangements, and how did it get into a position whereby its corporate  governance is not what it should be? Finally, how will budget revisions affect  service delivery, which he mentioned in relation to the language body and the  2009 budget?</p>

Therefore, I do not intend to answer that question. However, I will write to  the Member about that subject.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked about governance and accountability  matters with respect to the Ulster-Scots Agency. I shall take this opportunity  to address those matters more fully. The Ulster-Scots Agency is part of a  North/South body. Therefore, its oversight rests with the two sponsor  Departments: the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department of  Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the Irish Republic.  A range of significant governance and accountability issues have been  identified in the Ulster-Scots Agency, and the sponsor Departments have been  working closely with the agency&rsquo;s board and chief executive to ensure that an  effective financial control system is in place.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">My predecessor Gregory Campbell recognised that there were  issues in the agency, and a senior civil servant was seconded on a short-term  basis to the organisation to help sort out the problems. However, that action  alone has not resolved the situation. It is clear that there are ongoing issues  concerning the agency&rsquo;s strategic direction and about governance and  administrative processes.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I am determined to ensure that the agency is fit for  purpose, provides value for money, is efficient and effective and is good for  the community that it serves. That is what I said in the Assembly on 24  November, and that view is shared by Minister &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v in the Irish Republic.  Consequently, at the North/South Ministerial Council meeting on 2 December and  in the absence of the CEO, who was unable to attend due to illness, Ministers  agreed to designate an interim CEO to the agency to try to make progress on the  issues. The Ulster-Scots community is entitled to a first-class service, and I  will endeavour to ensure that the agency is, therefore, fit for purpose and  provides such a service.</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I pay tribute to foster  carers for the invaluable service that they provide to some of the most  vulnerable children and young people in our society. Foster carers are often  the first people to whom social workers and care workers turn when refuge is  sought for vulnerable children. Foster care is a service that can provide  anything from short-term respite breaks through to a long-term permanent home.  Finding a foster placement is the preferred option for most looked-after  children. Two thirds of the 2,500 children in care at any time live with a  foster carer. That is around 1,600 children, and not 2,500, as many Members  said. There are 600 care leavers at any one point in time. Around 400 of those  care leavers will have been in fostering placements, and half of them will have  stayed with their foster carers until they were aged 21, which is another point  that some Members did not properly appreciate.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I do not agree that we need another strategy for foster  carers. Instead, we should continue to focus on delivering the aims of the 2007  Care Matters strategy to ensure that we continue to develop services for  children in care and foster carers. Jim Shannon said that we do not have a  strategy; that is not true. We have the 2007 Care Matters strategy. Mrs Kelly  said that it should be a cross-departmental strategy, but that is exactly what  it is. We have spent the past two years seeking cross-departmental support for  the strategy and sign-off by the Executive, and that was finally achieved in  September of this year. Therefore, we have a cross-departmental strategy that  was signed off by the Executive only two months ago. It is a wee bit premature  to be running for another strategy.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Service and Public Safety</strong>: I will give way to Mr Shannon  shortly, but I want to get further into my speech. I am one minute and 59  seconds into my speech, and he is on his feet. He had a lot of fun earlier. I  will give him an opportunity to speak in a moment.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion states that 200 long-term carers are needed.  However, between March 2006 and September 2009, the number of foster carers in Northern Ireland  increased from 1,528 to 1,910. That is an increase of 382. It is true that many  of those foster carers provide short-term respite care for children in care,  and we have recognised for some time that we need many more long-term foster  carers. We are working hard to increase the numbers.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Around three years ago, the Fostering Network said that we  needed 300 long-term foster carers. That number has now fallen to 200. There is  no doubt that we are successfully recruiting such carers, although I am not  satisfied that recruitment is happening as quickly as it should, and we are  looking to increase the recruitment rate. However, we are recruiting more  carers than we are losing.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s motion also states that more than half of all  foster carers are of retirement age. Apart from the motion&rsquo;s basic ageism and  its message that people of retirement age should not apply to be a foster  carer, the figure that it presents is incorrect. The vast majority of foster  carers in Northern Ireland  are in their 40s and 50s, and about 15% &mdash; not 50% &mdash; are aged 60 or over.  Although it is important to monitor the age profile of foster carers, it is  entirely appropriate for some to be over the age of 60. A significant part of  our efforts has been aimed at recruiting children&rsquo;s extended families as foster  carers so that they can foster them. People are also more willing to foster  when their own children have grown up. The major advantage for children is that  it makes it easier for them to remain within the family circle and to maintain  links with their birth family and local community.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">The main aim of the strategy is to secure a measurable  improvement in the well being of victims and survivors. The overarching  principles are that the strategy will be victim and survivor centred and  address the needs of victims and survivors in a coordinated manner. The key  elements underpinning the strategy are the Commission for Victims and  Survivors, the recently established Forum and the proposed Victims and  Survivors Service.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The publication of this strategy places the needs of  victims and survivors at its centre and marks a step change in the way that we  will provide support to victims and survivors. Two of the main strands of the  strategy are in place, the Commission for Victims and Survivors and the  recently established Forum. We are currently analysing all of the responses  from our recent consultation on the proposed Victims and Survivors Service  which will become the funding and delivery body responsible for providing  support to victims.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Once this strategy is fully implemented and its structures  bedded in, all those involved in the victims and survivors sector will see a  more focussed, coordinated and needs led approach to how we provide support to  victims and survivors.</p>
