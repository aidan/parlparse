 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review has not provided a definitive view on the number  of deaths that can be attributed to the outbreak. The Northern Trust has  established two subgroups to analyse both mortality and the outbreak. The RQIA  review team found that the approaches that were being taken were appropriate,  and it commends that work in its final report.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such an investigation is necessary, but public confidence  is as much about perceptions as it is about scientific rigour. Any account of  the deaths that resulted from the outbreak needs to be not only rigorous and  objective, but independent. We must hear from the people who suffered as a  result of the outbreak; that is, the patients who contracted the infection,  their families and the people who have lost loved ones. We owe it to them to  provide them with an opportunity to have their voices heard, and we need to  listen to their accounts so that we can learn from their experiences. For those  reasons, I have decided to hold a public inquiry that will examine those  issues. I will advise the Assembly in due course of the terms of reference and  of the membership of the inquiry team.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">For now, the RQIA review team has identified several  valuable lessons that can be applied not only in Northern Ireland, but further  afield. Our clear duty is to act on those lessons across Northern Ireland  without delay. I thank the RQIA team for the important work that it has done,  and I will ensure that the recommend&shy;ations in its report are implemented for  the benefit of patients and their families, carers and loved ones.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that we are all greatly relieved to hear the  Minister&rsquo;s assurance that the outbreak is now under control. However, like the  Minister, we must acknowledge that the outbreak has rocked public confidence  seriously. Many people who are going into hospital now have additional concerns  and anxieties that they may be at serious risk of catching infections. I hope  that today&rsquo;s report will go some way towards restoring confidence in the  healthcare system.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has taken an intense interest in hospital  infections. When the seriousness of the outbreak first became apparent in  February of this year, the Committee questioned the chief executives of all  five health and social care trusts on the extent of the problem, not just in Antrim Area   Hospital, but throughout  the North. Committee members examined the action that was being taken to  address the outbreak at that stage, and we were minded to hold a Committee  inquiry. The Committee also came to the House and called for a full public  inquiry. Therefore, I particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment today to  undertake a rigorous investigation into the number of deaths that have been  caused by the outbreak of clostridium difficile. I also welcome his  announcement that he will listen to, and learn from, the experiences of the  patients and families involved and those who were directly affected by the  issues.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister provide any further details on the plans  for the public inquiry and its likely timescale? Will the specialist team that  carried out the inquiry on behalf of the RQIA have a continuing role in  ensuring that all the recommendations &mdash; both in the interim report and the  final report &mdash; will be implemented? Go raibh maith agat.</p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am  very concerned by the recent developments at Movilla High School,  which are now adversely affecting the education of all pupils at the school. It  is disappointing that the issue has come to this point. It would be better for  all parties if it had not come to such public attention. Teachers need to be  back doing what they do, teaching; and pupils need to be back in the classroom,  being educated. That must happen quickly.</p>
