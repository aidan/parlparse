     <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers considered a paper on the human resources issues  in the North/South implementation bodies and Tourism Ireland Ltd. They noted  that the two Finance Departments have considered the issues of pay and human  resources that the chief executives of the North/South bodies raised and have  concluded not to change the bodies&rsquo; pay structures. The Finance Departments  will, however, continue to consider and address human resources issues raised  by the bodies. The Council noted that the two Finance Departments are also  examining other human resources issues in the bodies and that a report will be  presented to the North/South Ministerial Council as soon as possible.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a paper on NSMC joint secretariat  issues and noted that construction work on the new permanent headquarters for  the North/South Ministerial Council joint secretariat will begin in Armagh in the coming weeks, with an envisaged completion  date in early 2010. It also noted that the NSMC annual report for 2008 was to  be published on the website &mdash;www.northsouthministerialcouncil.org &mdash; before the  end of April 2009.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a paper on EU matters that were  raised in the NSMC and noted the work on EU-related matters in accordance with  the work programmes in the relevant NSMC sectoral formats since May 2007. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy first Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: I welcome the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s statement, on which  I have a couple of questions. First, is there an update on the costings for the  work to create the North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s permanent headquarters in  Armagh, and is the deputy First Minister optimistic that that work will be  finished by the scheduled completion date in early 2010? Secondly, given that  my Committee is undertaking an inquiry into European issues, will the deputy  First Minister outline any EU matters raised as a consequence of the  North/South Ministerial Council meeting?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: At the meeting we were advised that Armagh  City and District Council will provide  the new accommodation for the NSMC joint secretariat in Armagh  and that building work will commence in June, with an expected completion date  of May 2010. The new accommodation will be on the former site of Armagh city hall. It will be a modern building that is  built to a very high specification, reflecting the highest environmental and  energy-saving standards and will be an important catalyst for the regeneration  of a disadvantaged area of Armagh city. It  will safeguard jobs and continue to bring economic benefits to the city.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The new building will provide the office accommodation and  facilities required to host meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council. In  the longer term, it should provide a more cost-effective means of holding NSMC  meetings than the current arrangement, whereby most meetings are held outside Armagh. Everyone looks forward to the day when  North/South Ministerial Council meetings will be held in the new accommodation.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The building costs fall to Armagh City and District  Council, and the northern proportion of additional fit-out costs of &pound;1&middot;5  million, which will be split between North and South, falls to OFMDFM. We are  confident that the work will begin in the coming weeks and be completed early  in 2010. Everyone in the House will agree that that will be a further,  much-needed indication of the importance of the institution.</p>
