       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Waiting times for orthopaedic  patients have been significantly reduced in the past few years. For example, in  March 2006, 5,017 people were waiting for inpatient treatment, some of whom  were waiting for up to 12 months. In contrast, at March 2009, of 3,567 people  waiting, only 102 people had been waiting longer than 13 weeks for orthopaedic  surgery. At 31 March 2006, 27,000 people were waiting for their first  outpatient appointment, compared with 5,919 at 31 March 2009, of whom only 35  had been waiting longer than the nine-week target. Patients now consistently  receive treatment within a matter of weeks. Those are considerable  achievements, given that only a few short years ago, people could wait up to  seven years for elective orthopaedic surgery.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName">Rev Dr Robert Coulter: I sincerely thank the Minister  for his answer and for the outstanding news on waiting times for orthopaedic  surgery. I congratulate him on demonstrating, once again, that he is delivering.  Will the Minister guarantee that he will continue to focus on the issue so that  further progress can be made in that area and others for the benefit of all our  patients?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I must mention the caveat that  much depends on there being adequate resources, but I can guarantee that  waiting times have been dramatically reduced. The first target was a 12-month  waiting time for inpatients. The waiting time is now 13 weeks, which is a  dramatic difference. Moreover, there are virtually no people waiting more than  13 weeks, whereas, in the past, the number could be measured in thousands.</p>

If the Executive take a  decision in that regard, which leads us some distance into the future, we can  look closely at the apparatus of what was created as NIW under direct rule  propositions.

       <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service uses established criteria to determine and  prioritise locations for the provision of all traffic-calming measures. The  assessment procedure considers various factors in order to prioritise the many  requests that it receives. Such factors include personal injury statistics; the  volume and speed of vehicles on the road; environmental factors, such as the  presence of schools, playgrounds, hospitals, clinics, shops and public buildings;  and whether the road is used as a through route.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The ultimate dependent factor for schemes is the  availability of funding. Given that the demand for road safety measures exceeds  Roads Service&rsquo;s capacity to deliver such schemes, the predetermined criteria  enable the establishment of a priority list of traffic-calming schemes. That  list helps to ensure that our limited resources are directed to the areas of  greatest need; that value for money is obtained; that no discrimination is made  between areas, for example, council areas and towns; and that equality issues  are managed. Therefore, there are no plans to introduce a scheme for  small-scale traffic-calming projects.</p>
