 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  accept that, but Members break down into three categories. First, there are  those who hunt Irish hares, and I have no problem with that, although many of  us feel that it is a very beautiful animal that should be respected and  protected. Secondly, there are those who would not kill an Irish hare in any  circumstances, and I am one such person. Thirdly, there are those who are using  the protection of the Irish hare as a means to an end in order to achieve an  end to what I call a barbaric sport. There are no other words for it. I have  seen it, and it is barbaric, particularly when participants place bets on the  fate of the creature as it is chased by two hounds. That is unacceptable in  modern society and totally divorced from the respectable day-to-day field  sports, which many in the Chamber have a great deal of sympathy for.  Association with this particular activity brings field sports into disrepute.</p>
 <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. We are going to discuss hare  coursing at a later stage, so I ask you to stick to the amendments that are  being debated now.</p>
 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  accept your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, but you can understand the point that I  am making. There is an overlap because due to the way in which the amendments  have been stacked up, we do not know what will happen downstream. Therefore we  have to allude to hare coursing, to some extent, when we are dealing with the  protection of the Irish hare.</p>
-<p class="B3BodyText"><strong>I will make it clear</strong>:  my preference is that the species should be protected, full stop. It should be  given the same protection as the badger, the otter or any other species. That  leaves a large number of legitimate prey species for the hunting fraternity to  pursue without any difficulties. I do not see any reason for not giving the  Irish hare full protection. I listen with great interest to the comments made  by Members and the Minister on this important issue.</p>

 <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McKay: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  The Bill is a lengthy piece of legislation, over which the Environment  Committee pored for many months. As Members have said, there are a number of  controversial issues that many people and parties in our community are  passionate about.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 adds five species to the schedule of birds  which will have their nests protected. That list includes the under-threat red  kite, which Mr Wells referred to. The Environment Committee recently went to County Down  to view red kites being released into the wild. That was a fantastic spectacle  of nature, and it is unfortunate and alarming that a number of those birds,  which were released into the wild over recent years, have been killed. It is  vitally important that those species are protected. Sinn F&eacute;in will support  amendment No 6. We will also support amendment No 7, which will protect seals  and grey seals from disturbance, along with the basking shark, as outlined in  the original Bill. Those species are all found in my constituency, North  Antrim, particularly around Rathlin   Island.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">I was over on Rathlin last month. One will find seals on  parts of the island which are popular with tourists. They stop near the shore,  and they are in close proximity to tourists and many of the locals on the  island. That happens daily all year round on Rathlin. Given that close  proximity and the possibility and probability of some interaction from time to  time, it is clear that that legislative change needs to be put in place.</p>

 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Certainly this is more viable in a lowland situation &mdash;</p>
 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of the Environment</strong>: I am surprised at the  ignorance demonstrated, which is the unfortunate aspect of this debate. A lot  of ground nesting birds nest in the uplands. When I talked earlier about  Glenwhirry, I should have explained that it is north of Doagh in the Larne to  Ballymena direction. It is very high ground. That is where they used snares to  take out the 600 foxes. As a consequence, we have more snipe, curlew, lapwing  and hares.</p>
