-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister and the deputy First Minister (Mr P Robinson and Mr M McGuinness)</strong>:  We wish to draw attention of Members to the presentation to the Assembly today  of a revised Memorandum of Understanding and supplementary agreements (MOU)  between the United Kingdom Government, the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh  Ministers, and the Northern Ireland Executive Committee</p>
+    <p class="B3BodyText">The First  Minister and the deputy First Minister (Mr P Robinson and Mr M McGuinness):  We wish to draw attention of Members to the presentation to the Assembly today  of a revised Memorandum of Understanding and supplementary agreements (MOU)  between the United Kingdom Government, the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh  Ministers, and the Northern Ireland Executive Committee</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The revised MOU supersedes Command Paper, Cm 5240,  published in December 2001 and is the principle agreement between the UK  Government and the devolved administrations of Scotland,  Wales and Northern Ireland  and sets out the principles which underlie relations between them. The MOU was  most recently discussed at a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee  (Domestic) in London  on 10 March 2010 and agreed by the Executive on 25 March 2010.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The MOU provides for a Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC),  which is the subject of a separate agreement in the MOU. In addition to the JMC  agreement, three separate overarching Concordats apply broadly uniform  arrangements to the handling of the Co-ordination of EU Policy Issues,  Financial Assistance to Industry and International Relations. The MOU includes  new arrangements setting out how the administrations will seek to avoid  disputes and, where this proves impossible, how they will be resolved. We are  committed to further work to improve this process particularly in relation to  the final stage of this process where a dispute remained unresolved. This will  include consideration of the role of an independent chairperson.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">This Memorandum is a statement of political intent, and  should not be interpreted as a binding agreement. It does not create legal  obligations between the parties.</p>
