 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We received a report updating the Council on the activities  that Safefood has undertaken since the previous meeting, including the  appointment of experts to advise on Safefood&rsquo;s proposals for an enteric  reference library. We also noted the ongoing scientific and promotional  activities of Safefood, including: preliminary discussions with the Food  Standards Agency in London with regard to sharing scientific information; the  launch of new research projects, including those on infectious intestinal  disease in the community and the completion of the gastroenteritis research  project; the extension of the allergy awareness programme; the food hygiene  awareness campaign; and the ongoing partnership work with other bodies and  agencies that was highlighted in particular by the award of &ldquo;best in show&rdquo;  stand at this year&rsquo;s Balmoral Show.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the establishment for three years of the  all-island obesity action forum, noted the development of a range of  communications initiatives in selected settings, including the workplace and  educational settings, and noted work to build a new evidence base from a range  of sources, including academia, research and action, and surveillance.</p>

A recommendation in the Committee&rsquo;s recent inquiry called on the  Minister to establish a designated suicide-prevention directorate that is along  similar lines to that which exists in the South of Ireland.

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am not clear at which meeting  I was expected to discuss the matter. I went to the Health Committee, but the  Member is aware that I got the report very late and did not have an opportunity  to prepare a definitive response. I have, however, taken further steps in  regard to the Health Committee&rsquo;s report on suicide prevention. I called a  meeting of the joint ministerial group on suicide prevention yesterday, and it  has agreed its response to the Committee&rsquo;s report. That response will now go to  the Executive. In doing that, I have done what the Committee asked me to do.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, at my previous meeting with the Committee I  indicated that the establishment of a suicide-prevention directorate is a  sensible idea. I am familiar with such organisations, given that something  similar was established in the Irish   Republic as part of the  work that was done there on suicide prevention. Indeed, that recommendation is  in the inter-ministerial group&rsquo;s joint report that will go to the Executive.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rev Dr Robert Coulter said that it was regrettable that  it was necessary to bring the issue before the House in the first place. I  fully agree with him. The fact that this lady sustained so many fractures after  she died is a matter that cries out for investigation, answers and justice.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">If there had been only one or two fractures, there may have  been a straightforward explanation as to how they had been sustained. However,  such a large number of fractures to a specific part of the body &mdash; the ribcage &mdash;  could not have happened without someone knowing. The pathologist&rsquo;s report  states that it is extremely unusual to see so many post-mortem fractures, even  in the presence of marked osteoporosis. That would strongly suggest that, at  some point during the handling or moving of the body, considerable force was  applied to the chest. The family are entitled to an explanation, and I fully  support them in their campaign for answers.</p>
