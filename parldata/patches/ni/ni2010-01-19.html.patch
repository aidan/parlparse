       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  T&aacute; ceist agam don Aire faoi eala&iacute;ona pobail ar bhonn trasphobail. Are there any  funding incentives available to encourage the promotion of community arts on a  cross-community basis?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I do not think that the Arts Council, which is  the organisation that disperses the money, has a particular funding stream for  cross-community projects. However, it has funding to encourage and support  cultural diversity. That is not quite the same as cross-community funding, but  I think that it has a remit to support cultural diversity. In fact, it is  disappointing that the money that the Arts Council received previously in that  regard, which came from the Department of Education, was stopped because the  community relations policy in the Department of Education was reviewed.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I am keen to get more money into the arts. People talk  sometimes about doing that in a cross-departmental way, but that has to involve  people bringing money to the table. If money is available in the Department for  Social Development or the Department of Education, I would be only too happy to  take that and contribute to more investment in cross-community, cross-cultural  and intercultural arts.</p>

       <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline his  Department&rsquo;s vision for developing the leisure and recreation potential of  Lough Neagh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 608/10<a name="AQO608/10" id="AQO608/10"></a>)</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Leisure and recreation around Lough Neagh  includes leisure and recreation on the shore, on the water and in the water.  Therefore, we are talking about a range of activities. I am aware that some  groups have organised musical programmes and festivals around the River Bann,  an obvious example of which takes place in Portglenone. Some leisure  activities, such as water skiing and sailing, occur on the water, and others,  such as fishing, take place on the water or from the shore. I am keen to see  the maximum potential developed so that the maximum use is made of Lough Neagh,  which is an excellent and important resource.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the recreational value, leisure and  recreation are an integral part of tourism. As such, essentially, they come  under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and of  the Tourist Board. My Department&rsquo;s functions in relation to Lough Neagh are  limited to a statutory requirement to dredge the channels and maintain  navigation posts at the entrance to the Six Mile Water as well as maintaining, as  a public service, 47 hazard markers around the Lough Neagh shoreline. Within  our limited remit, however, we continue to explore the scope for developing  Province-wide the recreational and navigational potential of all inland  waterways, including Lough Neagh.</p>
