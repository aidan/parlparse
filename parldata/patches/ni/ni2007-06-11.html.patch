Ministers will feel a sense of frustration, as they will want to  deliver new thinking during this financial year, but they are going to be  subject to significant constraints.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that we are inheriting a Budget from direct rule Ministers. We are also aware  that it has been largely committed to  Departments and to agencies. Furthermore, because of underspending in  the past, the practice now is to over-budget by approximately &pound;150 million.  Therefore, that amount of money will have to drop out of the spending plans to  make the Budget balance. More work is required to make Budgets that work and  are deliverable in the time indicated.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, this is the final year of a  three-year spending round, and a big effort is required to deliver on targets  to which commitments have been given. That is another factor that is creating  pressure this year. The Assembly and all of its Committees should be  considering that issue and demanding that commitments are met. Many Government  reforms that will deliver savings in the  long run need to have money spent on them now &mdash; it is important to spend  in order to save. However, it will be hard to stick to that, as a lot of  pressure exists. Nonetheless, in order to get public sector efficiency enhanced  in the longer run, that should be treated as a priority.</p>

That is  crucial. However, if progress is to be made, those efficiency savings cannot be made in the traditional way &mdash; by  making changes of 3% to the way that every Department operates.

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must examine the serious issue of duplication  of services: for example, despite more money being spent per capita on  education, less is getting though to classrooms than in any other region of the  UK.  If such issues are not dealt with, there is no point in tinkering around with  efficiency savings of 2% or 3%. Changes must be made to the way that services  are delivered that will ensure that there is value for money throughout  Departments and that that 30% overspend on education will be eliminated.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The huge costs of lost opportunities that arise from  segregation must also be recognised; for example, the loss of tourism, foreign direct investment and other major problems  that have occurred because of the difficulties in our society. If there is to  be serious engagement with efficiency, those costs must be eradicated. The  issue is not about where efficiency savings of 3% can be made but of the vast  amount of money that is wasted on the cost of segregation.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that there is to be yet another round of regional rate increases that are above  the rate of inflation. If the  Minister can ensure that those increases can achieve value for money, he  must also ensure that the excessive costs that must be treated as a priority in  2007 are not left for the future. So far, there has been relatively limited value for money from the  Chancellor&rsquo;s economic package. If  progress is to be made, more must be done to reduce the waste and  excessive spending of our own resources. Perhaps then the Assembly can go to  the Chancellor and ask for the additional money that is needed to invest in and  build the shared future that will benefit society and the economy.</p>
