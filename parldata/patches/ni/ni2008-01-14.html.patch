 		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">At this stage, Members should remind themselves of  the goals of the children and young people&rsquo;s funding package. That aims to  reduce underachievement and to improve the life chances of children and young  people by enhancing their educational development and by fostering their  health, well-being and social inclusion through the integrated delivery of the  support and services that are necessary to ensure that every child has the best start in life. As I mentioned  earlier, research shows that that approach will pay off in the long run.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs, in moving the motion, referred to some of the  activities that are funded by the children and young people&rsquo;s package. Those  activities include: the extended schools&rsquo; youth provision; addressing the  requirements of children with special educational needs; extended early years  provision; and examining how, overall, those activities have worked towards  achieving those aims. The Assembly must continue to support those activities.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the re-establishment  of the children&rsquo;s fund by the Executive will be a strong sign of their  commitment to the future of our children  and young people. I support the motion.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister has identified children&rsquo;s issues as one of its main priorities for the current session.  Members will be aware that it has just published an interim report on its  inquiry into child poverty. The report reveals that, according to official  statistics, more than 100,000 children still live in poverty in Northern Ireland.  It is also estimated that around 44,000 children live in severe poverty.  Statistics are always a matter for debate. However, it is indisputable that  behind those statistics, there are children who lack basic necessities and  whose life chances are reduced as a result of their impoverished start in life.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of its inquiry, the Committee received over 40  written submissions from key stakeholders. The evidence that it has considered  highlights the need for early action by the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister and, indeed, by  the Executive. The Committee welcomes the  Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment to work towards the elimination of  child poverty by 2020 and severe child poverty by 2012. However, the Committee  is concerned that insufficient information is available in the Programme for  Govern&shy;ment, the Budget and the accompanying public-service agreements on how  those challenging targets are to be delivered. Of course, there is still time  for that to be corrected and for the inclusion of more detail on how child  poverty is to be tackled in the Programme for Government and in the forthcoming  delivery and investment plans.</p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I want to focus on the universities&rsquo; achievements. I have been asked several  questions in the past few months &mdash; most of them written &mdash; on those issues from  a wide variety of Members.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have answered those questions and made it clear  that, in order to better inform policy in that area, we have commissioned  research into the decision-making processes  used by students. In other words, we are asking them about the steps  that they take when making up their minds about where to study. It is better to  go to the people who are making those decisions in order to gather accurate  information. I hope to have the results from that research in the next couple  of months, and, in light of the interest that has been shown by several Members  on this matter, I will be happy to share that information. We must ask the  people who make the decisions, and that will better inform us about the  direction in which we should go and the policies that we should pursue.</p>
