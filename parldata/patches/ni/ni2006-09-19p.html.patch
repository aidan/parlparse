 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The alternative to a culture of lawfulness is a culture of  lawlessness, where might equals right and the strong exploit the weak. While  such a culture prevails, we cannot build a fair, equitable and just society.  Northern Ireland suffers from a range of threats to the rule of law, including the continued threat of terrorist  violence; the continued activities of paramilitaries and, in particular,  their efforts to perpetuate social control over large areas of Northern Ireland; high levels of organised crime;  and the highest rate of recorded hate crimes in the United Kingdom. Those threats have huge economic, social and  personal costs for our community.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In far too many ways, the state and its agencies contribute  to that situation through accepting that the local  strongmen are the legitimate voices of communities and allowing them to  broker what does or does not happen in certain areas. Often it seems expedient  to cut deals and accommodations in such a situation, rather than tackle it head  on. What may seem to be a short-term gain often exacerbates the problem  further.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, it is often  the perception in the community that there is selectivity in how the law  is enforced. Too often, it seems that those who engage in mass public disorder, or act with paramilitary muscle, or use  implied threats, are only to be managed by the state rather than  addressed properly. Such perceived impunity is a threat to the rule of law and  undermines public confidence in it. There must be a wider debate on how, as a  society, we can adequately ensure that the rule of law is not only upheld, but  is seen to be upheld. There must be a concerted plan to address paramilitarism,  rather than pander to it.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party  believes that the recommendations of the Patten Commission represented a  fair and realistic set of proposals for the creation of a single, professional police service for all the people of  Northern Ireland. We recognise also that the proposals have, largely,  been implemented. Those who allege that the Patten Report has not been  implemented are often very vague on the detail.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Northern Ireland Policing Board (NIPB) has  been one of the few institutional success stories of the agreement. In fact, it  is a good illustration of how bodies that are established on an integrative principle can make a successful contribution to  positive change in a deeply divided society. The Alliance Party takes the firm view that the Patten Report should  be the conclusion of major policing  reform. Accordingly, there are no grounds to open a wider debate on  policing.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">However, the Alliance Party recognises that, since the  Patten Report was written in 1999, significant changes in best practice for  policing have occurred, and it is appropriate for those to be taken on board.  The biggest difficulty is the failure of all parties to recognise fully the  legitimacy of the police and to give their full support to the rule of law.  Even though such a situation has existed in previous Executives, it has become  increasingly clear that, in the medium term, it is not sustainable for any party to be part of Government, with  responsibilities for upholding the rule of law, while not supporting the Police  Service.</p>
