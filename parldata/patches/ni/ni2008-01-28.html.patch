 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I will continue to take a  close interest in this work. We pledge our full support for the four people who  are taking on one of the most important  tasks facing our society. I want them to know that we will be available  to them when they need us as we all seek to move forward together. For us, they  will be the primary authority on victims and survivors.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">In commending this announcement to the House, I ask Members  to give it careful consideration, not least because of the importance of the  work that we are asking the new victims&rsquo; and survivors&rsquo; commission to do.  Remember also that this announcement is really for those who have been largely  without a voice. Today, we are giving them a voice &mdash; a real voice. It is a  voice that will reach the heart of Government and will be heard and listened to  for the very first time. May God speed this work with His blessing.</p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Having visited many parts of Northern    Ireland over the past eight months, I am  well aware of the social and affordable housing conditions in those areas. As  the Member is aware, in September 2007, I visited  the Dunclug estate and another area in Ballymena.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I met the Member for North Antrim Mr Storey,  along with Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Mr McKay, in November. I was charged with the need to  upgrade that area of Dunclug. Interestingly, the Housing Executive is putting  to its board this month proposals for phase one of the Dunclug improvement  programme &mdash; an environmental improvement scheme. If approved, the Executive  will proceed to scheme, design and tender with a proposed start date later this  year. I will write to the three Members who came to me &mdash; including Mr Storey &mdash;  when I am fully apprised of the situation.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make an announcement shortly about the social and  affordable housing programme. In that announcement, I want to be able to  address the housing needs that exist throughout Northern Ireland. Many people &mdash; in  urban and rural areas &mdash; are on housing waiting lists and in need. As a  representative from a rural constituency, I do not want to forget about the  people who live in rural areas, irrespective of their geographical location in Ireland.</p>

Will the Minister undertake  to resolve that situation urgently as she considers the additional resources  available to her Department? Go raibh maith agat.</p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  That question does not deal with housing, but notwithstanding that, I will be  looking at the different aspects of the Department for Social Development when considering the resources  available. I am conscious of the situation with regard to children and  youth services, because representations on that matter &mdash; in the context of the  overall voluntary and community services &mdash; have been made to me. I will try to  address deprivation, need and disadvantage, because the Department for Social  Development is about building communities through addressing those vital  components.</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Considering Sir John Semple&rsquo;s estimate that 2,000 new social house builds are  required each year, does the Minister accept that the additional budget  allocation enabling her to deliver 1,500, 1,750 and 2,000 new units over the  Budget period is little more than standing still?</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Some history of the situation may be of help to the Member. When I took up  office on 8 May 2007, I had the funding to build only 600 new houses this year.  With the provision of in-year monitoring, I hope to be able to achieve the  target of 1,500 as specified in this year&rsquo;s Programme for Government. Following  the initial negotiations of the draft Budget, I had the funding to build very  few houses. I, therefore, consider the progress made to be an achievement in  thinking, research and negotiation. The winners are the people of Northern Ireland  who are on the waiting lists and those who have substantial savings and who are  trying to get on the first rung of the housing ladder.</p>
