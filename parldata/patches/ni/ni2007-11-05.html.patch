+	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: With permission, I wish to make a statement  on behalf of the Executive on public spending in 2007-08, following the  conclusion of the October monitoring round. As Members will be aware, the  monitoring process exists to help the Executive to make the most of the  resources at their disposal.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">A key element of that is the identification, by <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Departments, of resources allocated in previous  budg</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">ets</span>, which, for a variety  of reasons, will not be spent in this financial year.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The normal approach in the monitoring process is to  reallocate such sums to pressure points identified by Departments. It is not  surprising that such flexibility and pressures emerge during the course of a  financial year, in view of the fact that budgets are determined a considerable  period in advance of the actual spend being incurred, and when a range of  forecasts and assumptions have underpinned  the position. In addition, unforeseen issues emerge; for instance, the  recent incidents of flooding, which, I am sure that Members will agree, could  not have been anticipated by those setting budgets for the current financial  year.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, this  approach to in-year monitoring is the sensible  and pragmatic way to deal with the uncertainty that is inherent when  setting budgets. However, as Members will be aware, following my statement on  the June monitoring round, our position in this financial year is different  given that we have inherited it from our direct rule predecessors.</p>
