 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that there was general support for the way in which  community education was delivered under the old college system? Does he agree  that, since the amalgamation of the colleges, the minimum enrolment threshold  has been raised and that that has had an adverse impact on community education?  In the west, enrolments have dropped dramatically. Does the Minister share my  concern about the adverse impact that that is having, particularly on rural  communities? Will he look into that further?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Access remained a criterion before the college amalgamation could proceed. The  footprint of the colleges has not changed: the campuses all still exist. If the  Member has specific issues to raise about his constituency, I am happy for him  to write to me and I will take up his concerns with the relevant colleges.  However, I repeat that, based on the number of people that must participate in  a course to make it viable, colleges decide on the courses that they run and  the fees that they charge. Other Members have pointed out that part of the  problem is that several people sign up to a course, making the college believe  that sufficient numbers allow it to be run. However, some of those students may  drop out midway through the course or do not attend, making it unviable. If the  Member has a specific example that he wishes to discuss, I will be happy to  take it up with the relevant college. However, it is a matter for the colleges to set their own thresholds.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Dodds)</strong>: From 2004  to March 2007, Invest Northern Ireland (INI) worked with six Indian companies  to secure over &pound;65 million in planned investment into Northern Ireland,  promoting some 2,235 jobs. In the past three years, Northern Ireland has seen  increasing success from the Indian market. Investors from India include  Firstsource, HCL Enterprises, Polaris Software Lab, Pix Transmission, BPO  Services and, most recently, the announcement by Tech Mahindra.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">To build on that success, and with investments from India increasing, Invest Northern Ireland is setting up an office in India to  capitalise on the opportunities there. That  office will be based in Mumbai, and it will seek to promote further  trade and investment links with India.  The key sectors to be targeted will be the  areas in which Northern    Ireland offers a globally competitive  proposition, notably in financial services, business services and information and communication technology.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that informative  answer. We often hear about outsourcing of jobs to India, but it is good to know that investment is  moving in the other direction and bringing  much-needed jobs to Northern    Ireland. It is important to focus our attempts on attracting inward investment, in  particular in the financial services sector. It is also advantageous to concentrate such investments in particular  geographical areas. Does the Minister agree that the Titanic Quarter is  ideally suited for financial service investment?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The Member has made some important points about the significance of the Indian  market for Northern Ireland,  and he is right to draw attention to that. The Titanic Quarter has strong advantages,  particularly in the financial services sector. Other honourable Members have  also raised the point about locations, but Invest Northern Ireland does  not determine the location for any potential investor. That decision is  ultimately taken by the investor. Invest Northern Ireland tries to  proposition the Province as a whole, so that it is competitive in areas where  it might attract foreign direct investment. However, ultimately, the decision  on the location rests with the investor. If investors propose specific areas in  which they are interested, Invest Northern Ireland will work with local  stakeholders to best position that investment.</p>

During the summer,  several Ministers visited the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in the United  States; one of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s major displays was on energy generated by  willows and related issues. Therefore I assure the Member that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment will continue to work closely with partners to ensure that  what can be done to progress willow production will be done.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have something to tell those parties on behalf of the Northern Ireland  people and the taxpayers &mdash; that approach is just not getting the job done. The  DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are not cutting the mustard when it comes to executive  action, legislation or &mdash; for want of a better term &mdash; government. It is  difficult to <strong>identify the cause of that  inaction</strong>: perhaps it is the difficulty of having two inexperienced and  opposing parties forming the majority of Ministers in the Government, or the  more serious political problem of dissension within the enforced coalition; or  perhaps the whole government machine is rusty after so many years of  unaccountable direct rule. It may even be a blend of all three factors.  Whatever the cause, we have to ask whether, after 166 days, the two lead parties of the moment can deliver. The signs are that they cannot. Let us hope that that  changes.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In another sense, there is action that we in the Assembly  can take outside this ministerial inaction: we could begin the process of  revising current legislation in the Committees of the Assembly. That would have  a positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives. It would begin to change things for the  better. However, it would be preferable for the Executive to do what I am  asking them to do in the motion, and issue a timetable for Executive-led  business in the coming months so that we could all see an end to the drift.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly is meant to work, legislate and administer. It  is not meant to sit like a Third World dictator&rsquo;s Rolls Royce without petrol.

The absence of  legislation does not mean bad government, although there are pieces of  legislation that should be brought to the Assembly quickly.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, quick legislation is never good legislation. If  the Member had done more research on the legislative process and the drafting  of legislation, he would know that a piece of legislation is not ready to print  the day after a decision has been made. The legislative process and the  drafting of legislation require time and skill, and there are a limited number  of people who can do it. Very often, quick legislation turns out to be bad  legislation. So far, many of the Bills that have gone through the Assembly have  been Bills that were drafted under the direct rule Administration, perhaps a  year ago, and it has taken that long to put them on the statute book. That is  not unique to this Assembly; it is common to other Assemblies and Parliaments,  such as Westminster.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, there is a need for legislation. In particular,  there is one piece of legislation that should be included in the Programme for  Government when it comes, and that is legislation to deal with the transfer  procedure from primary school to post-primary school. That is one case where  the Minister should show urgency.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Member said that the Budget is being used as  an excuse to delay the Programme for Government. In his naivety, he may have  ignored the fact that legislation usually requires resources. The worst kind of  legislation is not only drafted quickly but does not have the necessary backup  to enforce it. That causes people to become cynical about the process of  government. Without a proper Budget and knowing what spending we have in place,  it is impossible to know what kind of legislative programme we can afford and  what resources we have to back it up. Therefore, while I support the idea that  we must have a Programme for Government in place as quickly as possible, the  opportunism of the Member for Newry and Armagh &mdash; who has not shown much  interest in legislation in this House &mdash; does not become him, nor does it become  this House.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I refute that suggestion in its entirety. Perhaps the Minister of Finance and  Personnel should make a decision on the Executive&rsquo;s Budget and on the Programme  for Government. The Minister for Social Development has said, time and time  again, that her Department should be given the money with which to build the  houses. Have we heard anything about the Programme for Government in the House?  No, we have not. Are we going to be treated to such a programme by the end of  the year? Thus far, there has been nothing but delays and slowdown in any sort  of legislative framework or decision-making.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: It  might have been expected that this motion would come from the Alliance Party,  as the only party that is not involved in the so-called Government. Therefore,  it is the only party that should not be embarrassed by the necessity for such a  motion or have to defend its own party&rsquo;s Ministers. That irony has arisen from  the fact that the motion has come from a party of Government, with two of the  main culprits in its own ranks. That fact has not been missed by Members who  spoke earlier in the debate. Therefore, I will not dwell on the matter, nor  will I dwell on the revelation on &lsquo;The Politics Show&rsquo; on Sunday &mdash; courtesy of  Mr O&rsquo;Dowd &mdash; that it was not even the Ulster Unionists&rsquo; first choice of motion  at last week&rsquo;s Business Committee meeting. There we are. It is amazing what one  hears on television. I wonder how many times, in Parliaments around the world,  ordinary Members have had to remind Government Ministers of their primary  function.</p>

It pledged to roll up its corporate sleeves and put right all the dreadful  things that direct rule Ministers inflicted on us. We might have expected an  avalanche of legislation, such were the pressing needs of the people. Instead,  we have inertia, paralysis and an evident failure to agree about anything in  the Executive, except to promote an image of peace and harmony to cover up the  complacency that appears to have gripped them.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Some declare their intentions at the start of their speeches, and others wait  until the end, but I will do so in the middle of my speech &mdash; the Alliance Party  supports the motion. There is a feeling that we are doing nothing useful in  this Chamber and that we are filling our days with discussions on non-binding  motions. Some of those motions are perfectly worthy and should be accommodated,  when times allows. However, they should not be centre stage &mdash; that should be  reserved for primary legislation, given that this is a legislative Assembly.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We in opposition are happy to support the motion that has  been brought forward by a party of Govern&shy;ment to criticise the Government.

We have  no such problem on these Benches, and we will continue to press for the  activity demanded by the motion.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">When we compare the record of this Assembly with that of  our friends in the Scottish Parliament, we see that no Bills were introduced by  the Scottish Executive before the summer recess, and that one Bill has been  introduced since September. That comparison shows this Assembly to have been  quicker to bring forward Bills and does nothing to fuel the claims of some that  the Assembly is not doing its job.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to state that finalising the Budget and  formulating a legislative programme cannot be done overnight. Those decisions  are vital to the future success of the Assembly. As such, the necessary time  and consideration must be given to them. We should not denounce OFMDFM or the  Executive for taking that approach. I am confident that, when revealed, the  legislative programme will show the benefits of devolved Government and how  that can impact on the daily lives of our constituents.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is sad that, since devolution has been restored, members  of the Ulster Unionist Party have sought to undermine the Administration  through cynicism. Now that we have our devolved Assembly, we must question just  how serious the Ulster Unionist Party is about devolution. The motion calls for  an Executive legislative programme. In my opinion, that is a fair request.  However, I believe that, unfortunately, the Member who proposed the motion has  done so for the wrong reasons. The Member for Newry and Armagh  has made an accusation that this Chamber is nothing more than a glorified  debating society. I believe that those were the words of Mr Kennedy.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Mr Kennedy said that someone else used those words, but I think that he used  them over the weekend. However, some debates, such as the one on attacks on  Orange Halls, should not be discredited by such a slur.</p>

Mr Kennedy began the debate by  bombarding us with figures and statistics, which is always a useful tactic when  there is no substance to the argument, and to fill up the allotted 10 minutes.  It all added up to nothing, but the most important figure among those that Mr  Kennedy threw at us was two &mdash; the two Ulster Unionist Ministers sitting in the  Executive. If we add on Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s ally, there are three Ministers sitting on  the Executive, all of whom can introduce legislation if they so wish. I have  not heard any of the many political correspondents who hover around this place  state that there has been any demand by, or any record of, those Ministers  lambasting other members of the Executive for not bringing forward legislation.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy introduced today&rsquo;s motion because this is a  serious matter, and he wanted to focus the attention of the House on what the UUP considers to be a problem. Several  Members, including one or two on the far side of the Chamber, have touched on  the relevant issues. I want the House to treat the motion as a serious attempt  to focus attention on an existing problem. Despite what was said earlier, the  public perception is that the Assembly is  becoming a debating society. The Assembly has been up and running for  some time, but has yet to deliver what the  public perceive as a punch &mdash; although some Members may disagree.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">High-hedges legislation has been mentioned several times. I  asked questions on that matter during the Assembly&rsquo;s  first mandate, and the UUP tried to progress the issue during the second mandate. I have approached two  direct rule Ministers and the current Minister of the Environment to try to get  such legislation passed. That legislation would be fairly simple and  non-contentious, and much of the homework has already been done.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, today&rsquo;s debate has been occasioned by the  persistence of private Members&rsquo; motions on the business agenda of the House.  During the Assembly&rsquo;s first mandate, there was 70% of Executive business and  only 30% of private Members&rsquo; and Committee business. In fact, the Business  Committee lamented the fact that there had been so little private Members&rsquo;  business. Plans were afoot to increase that by encouraging MLAs to produce  private Member&rsquo;s Bills and encouraging Committees to initiate legislation.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two elements are at work here. The first concerns the sheer  amount of talking that is taking place. Even some of the questions to Ministers  are major speeches in their own right. It is sometimes open to doubt as to  whether they contain questions at all. You and your colleagues have addressed  that matter several times, Mr Deputy Speaker. The second element concerns the  Executive&rsquo;s failure to lead the Assembly strategically. The fault for that lies  squarely with the two largest parties, in spite of what they have said today,  because they dominate the Executive. It lies specifically with the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister, and with their junior Ministers &mdash;</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The idea seems to have grown up in the Executive Committee  that until the Budget has been finalised, we cannot have a Programme for  Government. Why is that? Government financing is a continuous process &mdash; it is  like a conveyor belt. There is always a certain amount of money that we know  that we will have, and there is a certain amount of money that we may have. We  also have a borrowing facility, but I urge that we use that wisely, if at all.  Therefore, there is no reason why more of the business of Government cannot  begin immediately, before the Budget is  finalised. It is ludicrous to suggest that we wait &mdash; I hope that Sammy  is listening to this one &mdash; like the South Pacific islanders who believe in the  cargo cult, with money dropping from heaven, directed by the current object of  their worship, Gordon Brown. Sammy can research that for his homework tonight.  A good enough reason does not exist for the Assembly not to address the real  issues now. It must start to make  decisions, using the devolved powers that we possess at this time.  Business cannot wait for the corporation tax debate to be finalised.</p>

I am sure that people who  study events in the Chamber sometimes wonder why we are here at all.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Do I not have a couple of extra minutes, Mr Deputy Speaker? I have been up and  down like a yo-yo.</p>

If Members cast their minds back six months, everyone in Northern Ireland  was told that the Executive could not be formed until May, because it was  necessary to have six weeks in order to hit the ground running. The Executive  were not formed at the end of March, or in April, so that the parties could hit the ground running in May.  Since then, some parties in Government have failed to do that.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I wish to refer to the comments that were made  about the Minister for Social Development. People tend to forget that it was  the Minister for Social Development who introduced the first piece of  legislation in the House &mdash; the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development has been trying to  introduce further legislation, including, for example, Bills on charities,  child maintenance, and pensions. Those were signed off by the Minister long  ago. Why have they not been introduced? They have been held back by the Office  of First Minister and deputy First Minister. It is true that, in recent times,  the Department has released two of those pieces of legislation. However,  legislation that should and could have been introduced, and that the Department  for Social Development wanted to have been introduced, has been held up at the  centre of Government. I invite the junior Minister to comment on that.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Deeper patterns of concern are beginning to emerge in the  Chamber, and Members need to be aware of those. When the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in were  negotiating the St Andrews Agreement, they stated, as articles of faith, that  there would be increased accountability to the Assembly on North/South bodies.  Where Ministers&rsquo; functions were concerned, another St   Andrews article of faith was that three Ministers would be able to  bring one Minister to account on any matter, thereby increasing Executive  accountability. Although I am mindful of and respect the ruling of the Speaker  on statements about this matter, what did we discover a week ago when the  decision to re-advertise the position of victims&rsquo; commissioner was announced?  We discovered that there was no accountability to the Chamber either on the  decision not to appoint that commissioner or on the decision to re-advertise  the position, a process on which work will be carried out over the next four  months. On the one hand, therefore, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in agreed at St Andrews that the North/South bodies would be more  accountable, as would individual Ministers. However, they did not accept that  those who made decisions on high-profile, sensitive matters such as the  appointment of a victims&rsquo; commissioner should be accountable to the Chamber.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will give way in a second.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must be aware that a concerning pattern of treating the Chamber in that way is beginning to  emerge.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: The Member has made an important point.  However, will he state whether the SDLP Minister sought the support of two  other Ministers to have the appointment of the victims&rsquo; commissioner referred  back to the Executive?</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister, who is not in the Chamber, will take that on  board. <em>[Laughter.]</em> I am sorry; she is here, I was, literally, unsighted.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has not been an Executive meeting since the  announcement about the appointment of a victims&rsquo; commissioner. The Executive  met on the Monday evening, after the announcement was made and before the  agenda could be determined.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should be concerned about the wider patterns that  are emerging. Government business that will be held up includes the Irish  language Act, the 11-plus, and the RPA. Looking six months ahead, it is likely  that further legislation that will be held up will include that on the Parades  Commission review, the bill of rights and  the devolution of justice and policing.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the SDLP is putting down the marker that, not  only has there been no business of any great substance in the Chamber, but  major pieces of Govern&shy;ment business are already being held up, and more will be held up in the next six months. Gridlock is  emerging, particularly between the two major parties.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reason that Members should support the motion can be  summed up by what someone said to me in my Falls Road office last week. He said  that six months after this Government was formed there has been little  Government, no Government and bad Government. There has been bad Government on  the classroom assistants&rsquo; pay dispute, no Government on legislation, and little  Government on everything else.</p>

Ministers&rsquo; acknowledgement of the importance of legislation  is on the record, and since the restoration of devolution, Ministers have  sought, where possible, to introduce primary  legislation in several areas. However, Ministers must be satisfied that the legislation is required in policy  terms and is appropriate to meet those needs, and they must secure the  agreement of the Executive to do so.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that five Bills were introduced soon  after restoration: the Budget Bill, the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill,  the Libraries Bill, the Taxis Bill, and the Welfare Reform Bill. Three of those  Bills are under consideration by the relevant Committees.  Other pieces of legislation are being worked on and scrutinised. The same  amount of legislation has been introduced in the nine weeks of the Assembly&rsquo;s  present mandate as was introduced in the first 11 weeks of the Assembly that  commenced in 1999. It is important to put that on the record. It just so  happened that the so-called dominant parties in 1999 were not the DUP or the  party opposite: two other parties were dominant. It is important to &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP were not the dominant party then, but I thank the  Ulster Unionists for giving us the position of dominance today. I fully  acknowledge the importance of the Executive&rsquo;s informing the Assembly of their legislative intent as soon as they are able, and  we intend to inform the Assembly of the business for the current session  in a matter of days. However, several observations might usefully be made about  the subject of legislation.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, the Assembly and Executive were restored to bring  back accountability &mdash; an important issue that was raised by the Member for West  Belfast Alex Attwood &mdash; and to make the work of the Government here more  relevant. The Executive did not take up office to promote, without question,  the policies and legislative proposals of their predecessors. If people think  that the Executive came here to implement, willy-nilly, legislation that direct  rule Ministers had in mind, they are wrong. We intended to bring to this  process our own thoughts, strategies and policies and to implement what the  public expects us to put in place. All Executive members have brought their own  ideas to the table. It would have been an easy option for us to follow, without  apology, the policies of the direct rule Ministers, but we have considered &mdash; and have to consider &mdash; our own  policies.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: Does the Member accept that the Libraries  Bill is a good example of an instance where the Assembly will have to undo some  of the legislation that emanated from  direct rule and that it will lead &mdash; if it  goes through &mdash; to an unaccountable library authority?</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Paisley Jnr: Those are all points that the Assembly  and the Executive will consider.</p>
+	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: Does the Member accept that the Libraries  Bill is a good example of an instance where the Assembly will have to undo some  of the legislation that emanated from  direct rule and that it will lead &mdash; if it  goes through &mdash; to an unaccountable library authority?</p>
+	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>: Those are all points that the Assembly  and the Executive will consider.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the introduction of legislation is not an end in  itself. It represents one, albeit important, stage between policy development  and implementation. Legislation based on inadequate policy development and  consideration is bad legislation and will lead to problems when we try to put  it into practice. It is, therefore, right that Ministers are fully satisfied  about the purpose, effect and intention of legislation before they bring it to  the House &mdash; a point that has been ably made by other Members.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McNarry: I accept the junior Minister&rsquo;s valid  comment on direct rule, and thank goodness that we are here. He mentioned the  repeal of legislation introduced by direct rule Ministers.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">What provision will there be in the forthcoming Programme  for Government for repeal of legislation?</p>

+	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>: If the Member will bear with me until  the end of my statement, he will hear something that may at least whet his  appetite, if not entirely satisfy him.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation does not represent the totality of the  engagement among the Executive, Ministers, the Departments and the Assembly. In  the relatively short period since 8 May, some 100 pieces of subordinate  legislation have also been laid, following scrutiny of their policy content by Committees. Where appropriate, Ministers  have also considered asking the Assembly to approve  provisions in respect of legislation that is being passed at Westminster to ensure that those provisions are available  in Northern Ireland  at the earliest opportunity. The Assembly has consented to that in respect of  the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Bill, and a number of other proposals  that will shortly come forward after discussion with Committees.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is easy to take potshots and criticise the Executive for  not doing enough, but it should be recognised that a considerable amount of  work has already been done, which makes that criticism unfair.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy was critical of the Business Committee when he  proposed the motion. That was rather unfair because that Committee decides the  business to be done, and its timing. The draft Renewables Obligation  (Amendment) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2007 was brought before the  Assembly today by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and it was  allocated only half an hour for debate, which shows a lack of interest from  some of those who would be the first to criticise the House for not bringing  legislation forward. I am not sure whether the Member was interested enough to  contribute.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy also criticised the strategic leadership of  OFMDFM, and said that he wants it to follow direct rule Ministers blindly. The  Executive sets their own agenda, and do not follow dictates from another place.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member did not name one single piece of legislation  that he would like to see enacted, although he did make a comment on the rates  process. He also outlined what I can only describe as a recipe for financial  ruin, because consideration must be given to budgetary concerns before an  agenda is set. Therefore, the Executive are showing strategic leadership by  taking that process seriously, stating what they want to do, and asking how  that can be paid for.</p>

+	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>: I am coming to the Member in a minute.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy promised the Assembly jam tomorrow, which is not  a good policy. The Member for Newry and Armagh criticised the Government, and  if he must do that, he should at least be consistent, because he cannot claim  one day that Ministers are not getting on with one another, and the next day  write to &lsquo;The Newsletter&rsquo; describing them as &ldquo;Chuckle Brothers&rdquo;. He cannot have  it both ways.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Upper Bann Mrs Kelly mentioned eight pieces  of legislation that she would like to see introduced to the House. Of those  eight, not one was to do with the Minister whom she is closest to, which tells  its own story. If the Government and OFMDFM are going to be criticised about  the appointment of a Commissioner for Victims, it is important that the  appointment process should not be dragged into a debate in the House against a  background of Members having gone public and having named people in the press  who are not even shortlisted for interview. That brings the entire process into disrepute. When Members do that, they cast a slur on the credibility of  the Assembly, and the process, and they should bear that in mind. It is  little wonder that there was not enough confidence to put that matter up for  debate. Mrs Kelly raised two other points, one of which was PPS 14, on which a  remedy hearing will take place in court.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly cannot legislate where a remedy hearing is  ongoing. The Member said other things that were critical of the Government, and  one was the appointment of special advisers. Again, that is a matter for Westminster, our national  Parliament, and not a matter for here.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The slur cast on the Assembly has been amplified by the  conduct of some Members who turn up and debate in the way that they do. I am  glad that the Member for Strangford Mr McNarry is here. His revolving-door  antics last week, when he had so many walk-ins and walk-outs, brought this  place into disrepute, not the actual content of the debate. It is rather  strange to be told that there is a slur on the House and a slur on the  Executive when Members behave in that way.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some criticism has been levelled at the Executive, and  people wondered what the House would have done had it not been for private Members&rsquo; business. Knowing what is  coming, Members should be very careful about what they ask for. They might find  that there are extra days and extra sessions on legislation in the House. I am  sure that the same Members who are critical of the Executive today will be the  first Members to criticise the Executive for overworking them. However, we will  wait for that in the weeks ahead.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The programme will, undoubtedly, provide the Assembly and  its Committees with much to consider and debate over the coming year, as they  scrutinise the intentions of each Department.
