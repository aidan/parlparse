 	    <p class="B3BodyText">The continuous problem of landlords charging rent that is  substantially higher than the housing benefit rate for particular areas forces  many people into debt, and that practice is widespread. There are mechanisms in  place for people to make complaints, but most people will not complain because  of threats of violence or eviction. For many people it is better to suffer than  to sleep on the streets.</p>
 	    <p class="B3BodyText">In a question for written answer to the Minister for Social  Development, the Member for North Belfast Fred Cobain asked how many  enforcement orders had been brought against landlords under the Private  Tenancies Order 2006. The reply stated that district councils are proactive in  carrying out their responsibilities, with one enforcement case in Ards, two in  Ballymoney, 13 in Banbridge, 42 in Belfast, 14 in Carrickfergus, five in  Castlereagh, three in Craigavon, one in Down, one in Dungannon and three in  Newtownabbey. There was no mention of the other councils across the North, but  that is the standard under which those councils have operated. Many other  landlords lease houses that are in poor condition but have not been inspected.</p>

Many landlords supply houses to both sectors,  therefore, the whole sector must be regulated by the same legislation.</p>

 	    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The document went on to state that although the  Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations 1993 require  landlords to provide managers of schemes to pass on relevant information, there  is no incentive in the regulations to make them do so.</p>

I understand her point that the funding is not  intended to provide jobs for people. However, last week, half the staff engaged  on that project went without salaries; this week, all the staff will do so. If  interim arrangements are not put in place, is there not a risk that, by the  time final decisions are taken, delivery of service will have been negatively  impacted upon by the loss of qualified and experienced staff?</p>

 	    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the problem has been acknowledged at the highest  level. That is a start, at least. It would help if Access Northern Ireland  information were made accessible to us, as elected representatives, and to the  businesses and organisations that use it. Along with other Members, I am  concerned that, at times, it is impossible to gain information from Access  Northern Ireland  and that, at other times, such information is released quite slowly. From  speaking to other Members, I know that they have also encountered that problem.</p>
 	    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know whether the problem is with the system, with  the availability of resources, or whether it is a combination of both. I  suspect that it is a systemic problem and that the structure must be improved  and supported with the appropriate resources. Whatever the problem, a solution  must be found, because far too many people in our society who are vulnerable  and in need of the services that are provided by various businesses and groups  in our community are losing out. That is unacceptable. I therefore commend the  motion.</p>
