         <p class="B3BodyText">Over 200 countries will participate in the Games. Whilst 80  teams or countries have some level of agreement in place the majority of  athletes do not yet know if they have qualified for the Games, and therefore  cannot yet commit to a Pre-Games Training camp. The qualification process for  many disciplines will not be completed until late spring 2012 and a lot of work  is going on behind the scenes to attract athletes here in anticipation of their  qualification. Let me detail this work for Members:</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">26 facilities, catering for 22 distinct sporting  disciplines have been accredited for Olympic sports along with three &lsquo;hub&rsquo;  venues suitable for hosting Paralympic disciplines in the North.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">A working group, chaired by SportNI, with representatives  from DCAL, NI Tourist Board, Invest NI, Disability Sports NI and local  government, is committed to attracting both training camps and events to the  North of Ireland. The group has identified that the best chance of attracting  visiting teams to the North of Ireland for the Games, is to work with the  governing bodies of sports who have accredited facilities. SportNI has liaised  with all Olympic/Paralympic Governing Bodies and has identified those that are  likely to be able to attract a Pre Games Training Camp or Event.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">A wide range of marketing materials have been prepared  including promotional DVDs and brochures under the theme &lsquo;Raising your Game in  the Land of Legends&rsquo;. These have been distributed to  every International Olympic Committee throughout the world. In addition, both  DCAL and SportNI have given presentations in other countries promoting the  North as a venue, including Beijing, Berlin, Rotterdam, Seville, Jordan,  Palestine and London.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">SportNI have provided funding to Sports Governing bodies to  promote Pre-Games Training Camps and Events at a wide range of international  sporting competitions, conferences and exhibitions. SportNI recently made a  presentation on Pre-Games Training Camps to seventeen South American  Ambassadors at an event in the House of Lords which was attended by the First  Minister. SportNI was recently represented at the Sport Accord Conference  attended by over 100 countries and held meetings with various International  Governing Bodies to promote Pre-Games Training Camps and events.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">A number of sensitive and confidential negotiations are  ongoing and I hope to have positive news to announce once countries become  aware of who has qualified for the Games. However, given the recent media  interest it is important to describe the progress made to date in some detail:</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">Hosting such events offer immediate opportunities and  longer term benefits. In the short-term having international athletes train and  compete here provides a unique opportunity for our home grown talent and rising  stars in sport to meet, greet, observe and possibly compete with world-class  athletes and international sporting heroes at home. It is difficult to measure  the inspirational impact in economic terms that such a once in a lifetime  opportunity provides. However, it will inspire our young people to participate  and achieve and bring the spirit of the Games to our communities.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">For the visiting athletes, teams and countries, and their  support network including coaches, competing in our local venues will provide  them with first hand knowledge and experience of what we have to offer as well  as a guaranteed warm welcome and the opportunity to visit iconic sites and see  our outstanding scenery. It is anticipated that those positive experiences will  be influential in the decision making process when the time comes for the  respective athlete, team or country to make their selection for pre-games  training in the lead up to the Games.</p>

Over 25,000 children have participated  already with the potential to engage 91,000 young people across the North to  choose sport, to get them involved in some kind of physical activity and to  stay healthy. With the high incidence of suicide in disadvantaged parts of the  North and not least problems with obesity both &lsquo;5 Star Challenge&rsquo; and &lsquo;Activ8&rsquo;  are key and will support implementation of DCAL&rsquo;s overarching Policy and the  Strategy for Sport &lsquo;Sport Matters&rsquo;.</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">The aim has been to build on the capacity and capability of  volunteering in the North in order to make a major contribution to the  successful delivery of the events taking place here in the lead up to the Games  in 2012 and beyond, including the World Police and Fire Games in 2013, which  will require over 5,000 volunteers, and with further opportunities for  volunteers as part of the Derry City of Culture celebrations, and the  Commonwealth Games in Glasgow 2014.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">Over 900 applicants from the North were interviewed  recently by the London Organising Committee at Queens University.  DCAL, in partnership with Volunteer Now, has developed a Volunteer Bursary  Scheme that will provide up to &pound;30,000 of financial support to local people  from disadvantaged back grounds to enable them to go to London if selected.</p>

Almost 250 schools in the North are involved and benefiting from  Olympic related education materials, access to competitions, resources and  exchange opportunities with schools and young people in other countries across  the world. Ten schools are in regular exchange with schools in Jordan. My  Department fully supports this programme and is working with partners such as  DENI, British Council and a 2012 Sponsor to support an opportunity for those  young people to meet their counterparts in Jordan. Young people will have the  opportunity to forge international links, promote diversity and exchange  cultural values.</p>

Eight thousand Torchbearers will be required overall  with approximately 600 of these needed here in the North of Ireland. The public  have been invited to nominate local heroes to carry the torch through their  communities. I would stress that torch bearers are normal every day people and  I encourage all of my colleagues to promote this opportunity to participate in  the nomination process which closes on 29 June 2011.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the torch relay will showcase our local  stars, iconic sites, stunning land and our inspirational communities, to an  international audience.

       <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that we have challenges in respect of the  Olympics. Not least of these is the fact that over &pound;41m was diverted from  lottery to fund the construction of the Olympic Park; no actual Olympic or  Paralympic sporting events are taking place here during Games time; and the  perceived distance from London and the Games which may be a barrier to some.  However, my Department has forged excellent partnerships with government  departments, their arms length bodies, local government, community  organisations and important private sector organisations. These have enabled  good progress to be made. With just over one year to go, I would encourage you  all to work with my Department and the other partners already engaged in this  process so that we fully exploit this unique and once in a lifetime opportunity  for us all.</p>
