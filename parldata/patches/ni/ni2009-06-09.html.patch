Information on swine  flu is also available from the UK  swine flu information line on 0800 1513 513. Posters and information leaflets  that give advice to travellers returning from swine flu-affected areas have  been provided to all ports and airports across Northern Ireland.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I continue to receive full and detailed briefings daily on  the national and international picture. That includes participating, along with  the Health Ministers for Wales  and Scotland,  in regular COBRA meetings, which the new Secretary of State for Health, Andy Burnham,  will now chair. My Department also continues to work closely with the  Department of Health and Children in the Republic  of Ireland, and I will meet Mary  Harney tomorrow to discuss the current situation in Northern Ireland and the Republic.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the public and the Assembly that I am continuing  to give the situation the attention that it deserves. The World Health  Organization has now given a clear indication that we are moving closer to the  pandemic phase, and we will monitor developments very closely. I will report  again to the Assembly if significant changes to the current situation occur. In  the meantime, Members can remain assured that we have the necessary capability  to respond to swine flu. The health and social care service is well prepared,  and I thank Health Service staff for the commitment, support and dedication  that they have demonstrated in the face of a potential pandemic.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Despite new cases of swine flu being confirmed over the  weekend, I welcome the fact that the number here remains relatively low. I also  welcome the fact that those cases appear to be mild and that the people  involved either travelled from the affected areas or have been in contact with  someone who has travelled from the affected areas. How confident is the  Minister that the confirmed cases here are an accurate reflection of the  situation internationally, given that those affected have mild symptoms and  that some people will not present for advice or treatment?</p>
       <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 pm</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also referred to the situation in Scotland, and  media reports there have indicated that perhaps 43 cases of swine flu have been  confirmed in one day. That is obviously very worrying, but perhaps more  worrying is the fact that three people with swine flu are reported to be  receiving intensive care, although I am aware that they may have pre-existing  illnesses. Is the Minister concerned that our hospitals will not be able to  cope? Furthermore, are adequate plans in place for anyone who may require  hospital admission and for those who may need to be treated in isolation?</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Like the Members who have spoken previously, I thank the  Minister for his comprehensive statement and the daily updates that help our  work. I commend him and his Department on their work on swine flu.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I have a couple of questions. The Minister said that the  alert will continue. Will he outline how often COBRA will meet? He also said  that he will be meeting Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children in the  South, tomorrow. It will be useful to receive an update following that meeting  so that we can have an all-island view of the problem. In a previous statement  to the House, the Minister said that the incidence of swine flu may increase  with the coming of winter, which is something we should keep an eye on. Will  the Minister outline the strategies he will put in place to cope with that;  and, if it is not possible for him to do that today, will he write to Members  on that point, as we are being warned of the possibility that swine flu may  increase in the winter months?</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Security and Public Safety</strong>: As far as the final point is  concerned, the answer is yes; we have been warned about that. It is anticipated  that the flu virus may follow the patterns of previous viruses, abating in  summer and returning in winter. Damp conditions in the autumn will favour a  return of the flu.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">We have plans in place, and we refine them constantly. We  consider how health and social care services will respond. If the flu becomes a  pandemic, one third of the population may be affected, which will include one  third of the workforce in hospitals, GP surgeries, community pharmacies and so  on. Therefore, I have asked the trusts to plan for that eventuality because the  current Health Service may bear no relation to that in six months time as it tries  to cope with a swine flu epidemic. We will reduce services to those that are  absolutely essential, particularly in secondary care.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I will be meeting Mary Harney tomorrow at a North/South  ministerial meeting on food safety, and I have arranged for a round-table  meeting afterwards with her and her officials. My officials are in constant  contact with those in the Irish   Republic, where there are  now 11 confirmed cases of swine flu. Primarily, those cases involve people who  have travelled from the US  and Mexico,  but I believe that there is one case that has been transmitted locally.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">COBRA is the key driving force in the UK. It is  chaired by the Health Secretary in London,  and other Health Ministers are invited and take part in it. It determines the  national response to all the issues that I have talked to the House about,  including antiviral drugs and vaccines.</p>
