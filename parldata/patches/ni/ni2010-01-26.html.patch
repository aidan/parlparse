     <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the report of the Committee for  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister on its inquiry into  consideration of European issues; and calls for enhanced engagement and  improved interaction with the European institutions to raise the profile of  Northern Ireland in Europe.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In spite of ongoing political events outside the Chamber,  the motion&rsquo;s subject matter is important and should receive serious attention  from the House. Before commenting on the substantive matter before the House, I  express my gratitude to the people who assisted the Committee during the  inquiry.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The inquiry generated substantial interest. We received 41  written submissions and held 34 oral evidence sessions. On behalf of the  Committee, I express gratitude to everyone who provided evidence during the  inquiry. That includes oral evidence from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Members of the  European Parliament, the chairman of the House of Commons European Scrutiny  Committee, the Houses of the Oireachtas Joint European Committees and numerous  other key stakeholders. In addition to taking oral evidence locally, the  Committee made a number of important visits, including visits to the Parliament  of Catalonia, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the Scottish Parliament  and the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Committee has learned a great deal about  best practice from those Parliaments, and the report&rsquo;s actions and  recommendations reflect that.</p>
