     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dickson</strong>:  They do not do it in fields, apparently.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Minister, bearing in mind that, year on year, each country  that has hosted the games has attempted to improve on the facilities of the  country that held the games previously, are you confident that Northern Ireland  has the appropriate high standard of sporting facilities to deliver more than  90 sports? Given the superb facilities at New York  this year, can she guarantee that Northern Ireland will have state-of-the-art  facilities for the games?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Hopefully, a final decision on which facilities and venues will be used will be  made in the autumn, and we will then look at what we can do and how we can  broaden that out. Not every country had a team competing in every discipline.  Although I do not think that many beach volleyball teams will be competing &mdash;  but they may &mdash; I am happy to say that our beaches have received better approval  in the media than has been the case previously. I am also confident that,  although the games are being held in Belfast,  the World Police and Fire Games board is using every opportunity to examine  facilities across the North. In conjunction with the services, the board will  be looking to see where else we can maximise opportunities.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Is the Minister aware of any concerns among the relevant stakeholders as  regards the 2013 World Police and Fire Games delivery body, which was set up by  her Department? Given that that body and its chief executive are crucial to the  success of the games, does she have confidence in them to deliver the games?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The Member is right to say that that is crucial, and I am not aware of any  concerns about the World Police and Fire Games board. I am happy to speak to  the Member if she wishes to share any concerns with me. Thus far, I have  confidence in the chief executive, but I would welcome any Member bringing any  concerns regarding that to my attention. If there are issues that need to be  resolved, I would like to do so as soon as possible.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Sheehan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will other parts of the North  benefit from the World Police and Fire Games, which are to be hosted in Belfast?</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuilin</strong>:  Belfast made a  bid for the World Police and Fire Games and will be hosting them, but it is  anticipated that there is potential for other sporting venues across the North  to be used. I said that at least 15,000 friends and family members will come  here for the games. When I was in New York,  some of the athletes&rsquo; families said that they were prepared to travel from New York to Philadelphia  to look at historic sites. That might not seem a big distance, but it is a  four-hour journey. A travel time of four hours from Belfast would allow visitors to see many of  the attractions that we can offer in the North, and there should be economic  benefits for the towns and villages where the events might take place.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McKevitt</strong>:  On the back of her visit to New York  along with departmental officials, what lessons has the Minister learnt that  would be benifical to here, particularly lessons about the weather?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The hurricane coming to New York  and its impact on the games was regrettable. When I met the athletes at the Javits Center  and during the registration process, there was quite a buzz about the place.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asks what lessons I have learnt. I have some  observations that I intend to share with the 2013 World Police and Fire Games  board. The opening ceremony in New    York took hours and hours, because of the thousands  of athletes who were competing. We have a history of parading here in the  North, and I am sure that we could do things a lot better and a lot quicker.</p>
