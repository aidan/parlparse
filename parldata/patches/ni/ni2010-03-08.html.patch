     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Quite an amount of work has been done. As I said in  the statement, we will not know how effective that has been until the  evaluation of the work has been carried out. There has been direct contact  with, for example, the Orange Order and institutions therein and with community  associations that are representative of and exclusively in the unionist  community. I visited some of the projects that received funding, and we hope to  see an end to the under-representation of the Protestant community in the  applications.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">One of the problems has been that fewer applications have  been received from groups in the unionist community than from the nationalist  community. As a result, fewer applications are going through. That is where the  under-representation has occurred. We have been working with those groups.  There has been direct contact with them, and I have received good feedback from  some of the groups that feel that they got a sympathetic hearing and that they  received good advice and guidance on the projects that they are applying for.  At the end of the day, they have to meet the criteria. The more capacity there  is in the unionist/Protestant community, the more effective that work will be.</p>

     <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  and when he will launch a review into the response of his Department and the  Health Service to the swine flu outbreak. (AQO 881/10<a name="AQO881/10" id="AQO881/10"></a>)</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Northern Ireland has been one of  the best prepared countries in the world. My Department&rsquo;s response has been  proportionate, appropriate and robust. That has been part of a UK-wide response  to the pandemic. At all times, Health Ministers have collectively based  decisions on the best scientific advice from national expert groups. I have  already commenced a review of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s pandemic response. The review&rsquo;s  findings will contribute to wider assessment of the overall UK response  proposals, which are currently under consideration.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr PJ Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, in which he referred to a review. Does he  agree that there is a need to co-ordinate a regional response to epidemics,  such as swine flu, given that his Department holds a considerable stockpile of  unused vaccines?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The pandemic response was very  much a UK-wide response. England,  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland operated on the  best scientific advice that was available from the World Health Organization,  the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and the Joint Committee on  Vaccination and Immunisation. I have set out a number of steps that were taken  as we progressed through treatment into containment, such as strategies for  communications, surge capacity, hospitals, community services, critical care,  equipment, vaccines and so on.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the response is reviewed because that  is not the last pandemic that Northern    Ireland will see. The swine flu virus is  still circulating. There is still a possibility of a third wave of infection.  It is also anticipated that swine flu will make up the bulk of the seasonal flu  virus in 2010 and in some years to come. Therefore, the virus will stay with  us.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland got its share of vaccines according  to the UK-wide order. At present, the bulk of those vaccines is with primary  care providers and trusts. The vaccination programme continues. It is important  that a strategic reserve is kept in Northern   Ireland and in the UK.</p>
