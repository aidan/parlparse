 		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I have been asked to tell what the archbishop said, and I will do that in the  minute of my time that remains. I request some latitude, because Mr McCartney  has requested that I tell the House what the archbishop said. He said that  those people who tolerate criminality are incompatible with those who have  responsibility for Government. That implies that if one does not have a  responsibility, the toleration can be wavered. He also said that where there is  a commitment to the institutions of police, there should not be a problem in  the formation of the Government, especially if that Government do not have  policing responsibility. Dr Brady&rsquo;s implication there is that we should form the  Government now, and the commit&shy;ment will be given, and then, possibly,  delivered.</p>

 		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lewsley</strong>:  I preface my contribution by thanking the Committee Clerks for the hard work,  commitment and professionalism they showed during the PFG Committee meetings,  and for the endurance that they demonstrated during the debate about two boxes,  particularly. I also thank the Hansard staff for their professionalism and  commitment, especially con&shy;sidering that they were working with 12 short in  their team and with some of their people on  summer holidays.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The fact that all the parties got round an oblong table &mdash;  not a round table &mdash; at the beginning of the proceedings was progress, as was  their achieving consensus on nine proposals or basic principles. Sadly, that  consensus was turned into censorship by Sinn F&eacute;in just over a week ago when it  vetoed the opportunity for many of the political parties &mdash; including some of  its own members who attended the meetings during the summer and who gave their  time and commitment, none less than the late Michael Ferguson &mdash; to engage in  this debate, and, worse, the right to have the report printed. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  excuse for that action was that it was not taking part in any Hain talking  shop. However, in the comprehensive agreement, that same party, along with the  DUP, agreed to a shadow Assembly that was nothing more than a Hain talking  shop.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate, and I  will touch on many of the issues that were debated in the PFG Committee. The  issues debated in the Committee were not contributory to suspension, and,  therefore, should not be viewed as preconditions to the restoration of the  Assembly and its institutions.</p>
