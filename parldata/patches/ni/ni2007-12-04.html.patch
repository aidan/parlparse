 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether  the Minister&rsquo;s Department runs the current television advertisements  about Christmas parties and how people are getting out-of-their-minds drunk. Perhaps the money for those advertisements  comes from some other source. However, that advertising campaign appears  to be driving the message home. Does the Minister have any plans to establish  such a campaign on a longer-term basis, to drive home the message about date  rape, the undue influence that alcohol has on behaviour and the consequences of  being unable to make informed decisions when drunk?</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP, therefore, supports the motion, but would welcome  a cross-departmental strategy to tackle the societal problems that binge  drinking poses.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Excessive alcohol  consumption by males and females makes them more vulnerable to unwanted  attentions and can also alter their ability to make decisions. Research by the  University of Ulster, which examined alleged sexual assaults over the period  1995 to 2005, concluded that young women in Northern Ireland are leaving  themselves vulnerable to rape or serious sexual assault because of their binge  drinking. The research findings showed that the average alcohol level at the  time of an alleged assault was almost three times that of the drink-driving  limit. The study also failed to find any trace of specific date-rape drugs such  as GHB, Rohypnol or ketamine. However, the  report did caution that delays in reporting alleged assaults and in  taking samples of bodily fluids, could mean that such drugs might no longer be  detected.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must acknowledge that excessive alcohol consumption  increases a person&rsquo;s tendency to take risks and to put themselves at greater  risk from others.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">To that end, further to  the successful public-awareness campaign,  we are also working with the drinks industry, particularly on efforts to  encourage bar staff to refuse to serve alcohol to someone who has clearly  already had enough. My Department is implementing the new strategic direction for alcohol and drugs, and  the strategy&rsquo;s aim is to reduce the level of alcohol- and drug-related  harm. It also focuses on young people&rsquo;s drinking.</p>

Therefore,  one of the Department&rsquo;s key focuses is on reducing excessive alcohol  consumption. Binge drinking carries with it a range of risks, which is why we  have undertaken a regional public-information campaign to tackle it.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon mentioned how times have changed. Over the past generation, the range of alcoholic  products and the number of outlets that sell alcohol have grown  dramatically, yet the relative cost of alcohol has decreased dramatically.  Those factors, combined with powerful advertising campaigns for alcoholic  drinks, mean that we, as a society, are drinking much more.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 03 July 2007, the Westminster Government published a  Green Paper entitled &lsquo;The Governance of Britain&rsquo;, which sought to address two  basic questions: how to hold to account those in power, and how to uphold and  enhance the rights and responsibilities of the citizen. Paragraph 143 states:</p>

It was simply the  opposite; concern about the fragility of the Union  initiated the motion.

Nobody reading the motion  would think that we had forged, with the  greatest difficulty, a way of conducting politics that embraces the  whole community. That way of conducting politics achieved its summit in the  Good Friday Agreement. Despite  protestations to the contrary, that is essentially where we still stand.</p>
