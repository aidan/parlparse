 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. The sum of &pound;1&middot;5 million that has been  allocated to enhance the collection of rates arrears compares with a bid from  Land and Property Services for &pound;2 million in the June monitoring round. Will  that be entirely adequate to meet the backlog in rate collection, which is part  of the Minister&rsquo;s potential income?</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also notice that the Minister called for Committees to  robustly challenge the expenditure performance of Departments. Will he remind  his fellow Ministers of the importance of ensuring that Committees get adequate  time to carry out that process, given that that has not been the case for  several Committees so far?</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, on a technical point, will the Minister ask his  staff to examine the figures in table 2 of his statement? It seems that several  figures have misplaced decimal points, which suggests that Departments are  doing better than they actually are.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minster of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Mr Ford&rsquo;s concern about the decimal points has been  duly noted. If the figures are wrong, they will be corrected.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of reducing the level of rates arrears as  quickly and by as much as possible has been raised in Committee and elsewhere.  A certain amount of rates arrears will be accrued every year, because some  people, by nature, will not pay as quickly as others. Steps have recently been  taken to reduce substantially rates arrears. The extra money allocated will  reduce rates arrears even further. It is important that we do that. The money  will also fund the reform agenda of Departments.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like Mr Ford, I am also concerned that Committees do not  have sufficient time to challenge Departments&rsquo; expenditure performance. We must  work to ensure that Committees have sufficient time to examine those issues. I  know that the Committee for Finance and Personnel has done some work on that. I  have pledged the full co-operation of my officials with the Committee on that  piece of work.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Mr Ford&rsquo;s point about rates arrears  collection is a reminder about the importance of rates relief for small  businesses. From reports, I understand that rates relief is available to small  businesses in England, Scotland and Wales. Will he comment on, or give  an assessment of, the possibility of rates relief for small business in the  future?</p>
