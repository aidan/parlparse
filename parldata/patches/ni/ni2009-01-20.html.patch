           <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party also supports amendment Nos 2 and  6, which were tabled by the Alliance Party, and amendment No 4, which was  tabled by the SDLP. I believe that those amendments seek to achieve the same  ends as the Ulster Unionist Party amendments, in that they try to move clause 1  away from a power grab and towards a co-operative mechanism that is suitable  for the purpose of addressing an emergency situation. That is what we agreed  to, and that is what we should get. Those amendments have been tabled in an  attempt to increase democratic accountability and facilitate a genuine sharing  of power.</p>
           <p class="B3BodyText">I implore the DUP Back-Benchers to think carefully about  what they are doing today. They are about to create new powers for the Office  of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister that are well outside the  norm of the rest of the United Kingdom. The Financial Assistance Bill is a  thoroughly un-British Bill, which the leaders of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have  dreamed up together. It will effectively create a politburo office, without the  constitutional constraints that are necessary in this society. Is that what  those DUP Back-Benchers want to be involved in? Has the desire of their leader  to grab power made the rest of that party lose control of its senses?</p>
           <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness will suggest today that the  smaller parties are getting carried away. Is that scaremongering? Yes, of  course it is. I suggest in advance that all legislation can be abused, and bad  legislation especially so. Why take the chance with the British parliamentary  system and the people of Northern    Ireland? The Ulster Unionist Party is not  asking for the Bill to be thrown out; it is asking for a common-sense,  realistic and co-operative approach.</p>

           <p class="B3BodyText">On Monday 5 January 2009, my Committee held an emergency  meeting and agreed to the junior Ministers&rsquo; request for accelerated passage of  the Financial Assistance Bill. After that meeting, the Committee wrote to the  First Minister and deputy First Minister in order to seek further information  on the proposed amendment to the ministerial code and on the Executive&rsquo;s  decision-making process in relation to the Bill. On Wednesday 14 January 2009,  prior to the Executive meeting on 15 January, the Committee was briefed by  departmental officials from OFMFDM on the First Minister and deputy First  Minister&rsquo;s proposed amendments to the Financial Assistance Bill and to the  ministerial code.</p>
           <p class="B3BodyText">An additional meeting of the Committee was held on Monday  19 January in order to consider the Executive&rsquo;s four agreed amendments, which  were placed on the Marshalled List, and to consider the proposed change to the  ministerial code. Mr Shannon proposed that the Committee agree amendment No 3.  The Committee divided on the proposal: six members voted Aye, one member voted  No, and one member did not vote. Mr Shannon proposed that the Committee agree  amendment No 9. The Committee divided on the proposal: six members voted Aye,  one member voted No, and one member did not vote.</p>
