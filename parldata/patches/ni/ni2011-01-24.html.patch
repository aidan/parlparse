     <p class="B3BodyText">This amendment changes the date for the commencement of the  Bill from September 2010 to the date on which it gains Royal Assent. The reason  for the amendment is that the Bill was originally printed for consideration  prior to last summer&rsquo;s recess. However, it was not moved as a number of parties  sought further information on the implications of the changes to the existing  allowances regime. The replacement allowances provisions, as agreed by the  Assembly on 13 December 2010, will also come into operation on that date.</p>
