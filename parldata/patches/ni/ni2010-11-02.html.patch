     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  The Minister may be aware that the Committee for Education met school principals  recently. To that end, what discussions has she had with school principals  and/or their representatives about the Budget?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I meet school principals on a daily basis, and we have regular  discussions about the priorities for what needs to happen. As I outlined, the  sequence of events is that we have discussions with the British Prime Minister  through our First and deputy First Ministers and then we prioritise our draft  Programme for Government and budgets as an Executive and an Assembly. That is  consulted on, and school principals will be a major part of any consultation,  as will all education stakeholders. I have no doubt that other Departments will  be carrying out similar consultations.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: Has  the Minister had time to read the Oxford Economics report on the financial  benefits of shared education? Is she prepared to meet the Integrated Education  Fund to discuss that further?</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minster of  Education</strong>: As I said, I will be available to meet groups from all education  sectors, and consultations will be organised at the right point in the process.  The Member knows that, at all times, I have met the integrated sector and  worked very closely with its representatives. Members can see that there has  been a growth in that sector during my term in office. I look forward to that  growth continuing, and development proposals have been brought to me on the  transformation of schools and the creation of new schools. As I outlined in my  comprehensive answer to the Member&rsquo;s colleague, I believe in integration and  integrating.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have said clearly that I am willing and ready to play my role  as Minister of Education in the process as set out by the Executive. I will not  say that again, because it would be boring for Members if I were to repeat  myself too often; I would not like Members to be bored. I will play my role,  and I am already way ahead of the posse. I very much look forward to Members on  the opposite Benches supporting the establishment of the Education and Skills  Authority. In bringing that forward, we would save &pound;80 million in four years,  which could go towards front line services. Therefore, I look forward to  support from the Benches opposite.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">The new strategic direction for alcohol and drugs, which  was published in October 2006, will now be updated and extended for a further  five years. The areas likely to have additional focus in the revised document  include legal highs, prescription drug misuse, cocaine misuse and improving  family support and involvement.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the  commitment and dedication of all the individuals and the community and  voluntary organisations working in this area. They perform difficult jobs,  often with little recognition or reward, but they have a real impact on the  lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society and help to make our  communities better places to live. We will only begin to truly have an impact  on drug and alcohol misuse when we take a holistic, integrated and co-ordinated  approach. Let us be clear about this: we all have a responsibility to tackle  the issue, and we need to work together across Departments and sectors in order  to do so.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to point out to Mr Anderson &mdash;  I see that Mr Moutray has departed from the Chamber &mdash; that the Northern Ireland  Health Service is the worst funded Health Service in the whole of the UK. People in Northern Ireland do worse than those in any  other part of the UK.  The Health Service has recently been battling with a &pound;160 million cut, which  this House voted through. It is very difficult to fund the sort of activity  that we need to fund against that background. I ask Mr Anderson to consider  carefully his approach to protecting the health budget. The amount spent on  health provision here is over &pound;600 million behind what is spent in England, and we  are falling further and further behind. It is up to the House to determine  whether the issues that we are talking about here are a priority, and, if they  are, we need to fund them properly. We are talking literally about life and  death issues for large numbers of our population, particularly youngsters.</p>
