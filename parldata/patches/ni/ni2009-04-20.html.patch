       <p class="B3BodyText">We have encouraged the forum to challenge us, and I am  confident that it has and will continue to do so. The group will provide a  useful platform on which the various sectoral interests can talk, not only to  government but to each other. It is our hope that the forum will become an  effective vehicle for improving communication between the various interests on  which our economy is built.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">As the scale of the global economic challenge emerged, we  did all that we could to ensure that we did not talk ourselves into a  depression by talking down the economy and dampening business confidence, while  always remaining realistic. This is now the time to recognise that Northern Ireland  will emerge from the current economic problems and get back to growth and  prosperity. The establishment of the cross-sector advisory forum underscores  our conviction that we are not helpless in the face of the economic challenges  before us. It will not only be a critical friend to challenge us in what we are  doing or failing to do but will work constructively with government to bring  forward proposals for remedial actions. It will allow us to test that we are  not only doing things right but are doing the right things to bring forward  economic recovery.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">As we navigate our way out of the present economic  difficulties and chart our course for the future, we will, of course, keep the  Assembly and the Committee informed of the work of the forum. I believe that  its creation is a clear recognition of the value that we place on working  together in partnership with stakeholders so that we can use devolution to help  the entire community.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">It was reported that a 20% increase in the number of  childminders would be needed if the current demand were to be met &mdash; that was  reported in 2002. Unfortunately, there has actually been a decrease in the  number of childminders rather than an increase, which has resulted in many  parents having to employ relatives to care for their children. Unfortunately, as  I pointed out earlier, relatives who act as childminders do not have access to  the childcare element of the tax credit system. That is a further financial  burden for people who need childcare facilities, because they have to pay for  it out of their own pockets instead of being able to claim for it through the  tax credit system.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">A change to that system would result in more people seeing  childcare as a clearly defined career that could be developed and coming  forward to become registered childminders. It would ensure also that quality  services are provided for children &mdash; a suitably qualified workforce is always  essential for that.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">In England,  a transformation fund is available that provides people working in childcare  with opportunities, so that a more professional early-years workforce can be  established. I hope that implementing such a fund here is something that will  be considered.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare is important from the perspective of child,  parent and service provider. It is a tool essential to bringing us all out of  this economic downturn. We are experiencing a great shift in attitudes: there  is now an acceptance that equality plays a part in all aspects of life,  including childcare. Any provision must be child-centred and suitable for the  needs of the workforce during this difficult economic period. A flexible and equality-driven  service must be the core of any strategy, and such strategies must be open,  transparent and contributed to by all Ministers. In the delivery of such a  service, there must be a strong interdepartmental element.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The cost of childcare is too great for many families. We  need affordable provision that encourages parents to get back to work and  dispels the belief that it is not worth working because one will only work to  pay for one&rsquo;s childcare. If we get more people back to work, we stand a better  chance of stimulating the economy by increasing the disposable income of  working parents, rather than increasing the number of those dependent on  benefits.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The fiasco of the working tax credit, and all the  controversy that goes with that, is really off-putting for many people who are  considering going back to work, together with the fact that the childcare  element of it is not available if the carer is a relative. That is the case for  many people in Northern    Ireland, where, for example, many  grandparents provide childcare. The lack of places is high on the complaints  list, as is the need for a more flexible service to fit the needs of the  flexi-worker.</p>

We hear that the administrators are trying to take action  against the Visteon workers to remove them from the site. Perhaps the  Minister&rsquo;s Department could look at clawing back some of the money that Invest  NI gave to Visteon over the years. We should send out a clear message of  support for the workers in the Ford Visteon plant in west Belfast in the hope  that the administrators will call off their attempt to remove them. Dialogue is  the only way forward in this case, and Sinn F&eacute;in urges that.</p>

Indeed, and instead, our focus should be on what is required to  deliver an effective service and what is required to deliver safe and  good-quality care. If we are reducing our reliance on hospital beds and are making  better use of support staff and focusing on preventative care, we must be  prepared to adjust the workforce numbers to match the work that is required.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The Appleby Report made it clear that there was real scope  to deliver hospital services that improve the quality of care and allow us to  target resources to those most in need. My Department is ensuring that that  happens, and that is largely what we are talking about now. In fact, all of the  Appleby recommendations are under way or have been implemented.

       <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Appleby therefore recommended that there must be  some way around the implications of the Barnett formula in relation to health  and social care if the assessed funding requirement was to be delivered. How  unfortunate that that was the only recommendation from the Appleby Report that  has been ignored.

We simply cannot give  anymore; there is no slack in the system.
