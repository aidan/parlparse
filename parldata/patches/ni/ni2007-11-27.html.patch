 	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, I do not think that we must close the door on it entirely: we can learn lessons from  elsewhere, and particularly from Scotland. The Scottish Government  have recently decided to abolish council tax and replace it with a local income  tax. I understand that that is to be the subject of a public consultation in  the coming months. As Scotland proceeds at pace with a local income tax, it is  my view, shared by the Committee for Finance and Personnel, that it may be best  to maintain a watching brief on developments there for the time being, rather  than commission further work of our own on that matter.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that was examined during the review was that  of circuit-breakers, which is the curious title given to relief schemes found  in some parts of North America, whereby a  limit is placed on the percentage of income that defined groups &mdash; pensioners,  or ex-service personnel, etc &mdash; are required to pay in property tax. At first  sight, that seems an attractive option. However, several factors effectively  rule it out as a realistic option for consideration in the Northern Ireland  context. Research shows that, where circuit-breakers exist, there tends not to  be the safety nets of other reliefs for the poorest households, such as those  that exist in Northern    Ireland through the UK-funded housing  benefit system.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Introducing circuit-breakers here would, therefore, cause major complications in working alongside  housing benefit and, potentially, could shift the funding of the support  of vulnerable groups from annually managed expenditure to the departmental  expenditure limit. Introducing a circuit-breaker system would also be  administratively complex, given the need to gather detailed information on the  income of all ratepaying households. It will also be vulnerable to fraud. I,  therefore, propose not to pursue that option further.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Next steps include the publication of a paper later this  week that will set out the findings of the rating review in detail, including  the options considered and those that were not recommended. Some immediate  actions must be progressed over the coming months in order to implement the  proposals: first, in order to advance the recommendations on single-pensioner discount, I will need to engage in a targeted  consultation exercise that takes on board the views of all interested  parties before introducing subordinate legislation for April 2008. At the same time, I will progress subordinate  legislation to raise the savings limit for pensioners to &pound;50,000 from April  2008. After that, I will begin work on pre-legislative tasks such as the  integrated impact assessments and the consultation that is required to  introduce the proposals for the rating of vacant  domestic property, the proposed deferment scheme for pensioners, an  agreed revision to the maximum capital value, and any legislation that is  required on rate relief for those in full-time education and training.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, I will engage in preparatory work  associated with the primary legislation required to intro&shy;duce the new rate  rebate for energy efficiency and zero carbon housing. Work will also be  required on the legislative implications of the longer-term changes such as  derelict land taxation and improved data sharing to facilitate relief take-up.  That will require considerable research and discussion with some of my  ministerial colleagues.</p>

           <p class="B3BodyText">For goodness&rsquo; sake, let me finish. The Treasury was flush with money, and spending across all the  regions of the United    Kingdom was going up at twice or three times  the rate of inflation. That was the time when one would have thought that they  could have squeezed the most out of the Government at Westminster. Yet, that did not happen.  Nevertheless, during that period, before devolution was set up &mdash; and it has  already been set out and, therefore, I am not going to go through it again &mdash;  the end-year flexibility; the &pound;100 million addition to the CSR moneys coming  through; the release of asset sales; the access to end-year flexibility; and,  on top of that, in the current CSR negotiations,  the additional moneys that came through &mdash;</p>
