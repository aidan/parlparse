         <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>The Minister of Finance and Personnel</strong>: The issue of arrears has  been raised many times in the House, and I agree with the Member&rsquo;s comments.  Last year, the figure for rate arrears was approximately &pound;124 million, and I am  determined to tackle that issue and ensure that that figure is not repeated. It  is essential that we bring that money in. It should be borne in mind that the  effect on councils is realised only when any arrears are eventually written  off. In any business or Government there will be always be a certain amount  that cannot be recovered. However, it is right and proper that rate arrears  should be brought in as quickly as possible.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that, because of the economic downturn  and the difficulty that people are experiencing in paying household bills, LPS  is finding it more difficult to recover rate arrears this year. I am sure that  Members will have encountered some cases of hardship in their constituencies  and in advice centres. We must recognise that, although we want to ensure that  money that is owed to the Government is paid, that some people are finding it more  difficult to pay bills this year. As a result, we must be careful. That tension  exists, but we must do everything possible to reduce the arrears bill.</p>

         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The bonus scheme for senior civil servants in the  Northern Ireland Civil Service is based on the pay strategy across GB  Departments. That in turn is informed by the independent annual report of the  Senior Salaries Review Body, which makes recommendations on the total senior  civil service pay bill and, within that, what proportion of the pay bill should  be paid as non-consolidated bonuses as opposed to consolidated pay rises.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">In January 2009, Sir David Normington published a report  commissioned by the Cabinet Office. I am analysing that report, along with my  officials, and I intend to make further comment in due course.</p>
