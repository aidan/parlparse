 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson may want to add levels of government, but I  certainly do not. I want to ensure efficiency and effectiveness, while at all  times taking into account the citizens who are at the centre of our concerns.  Performance-management arrangements will be put in place and developed so that  key drivers will ensure efficiency in the new councils. I reiterate that this  is a process, not an event.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson said that he was happy with 26 councils. I got  the feeling from his speech that he would like to see the introduction of  parish councils. He was the only Member to say that he felt that the 26-council  model was sustainable in the long run. He pointed out that Wales has 22  councils. Even though the population of Wales is 3&middot;5 million, and our  population is nowhere near that, Brian Wilson said that we needed 26 councils.  I thought that the Green Party was against waste, but it is obviously not. I  have been called many things in my life, but I have yet to be called a  bureaucrat.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Wales has 22  councils for 3&middot;5 million people. Surely, if we are to follow the Welsh example,  which Brian Wilson seems to be keen on, 1&middot;7 million people should have 11  councils. That represents half the Welsh numbers. Maths may not be a strong  point for some Members, but clearly, if we followed the Welsh example, we would  end up with 11 councils.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea began by completely misunderstanding a point  that was made by Dr Farry, who talked about a boundary review every eight to 12  years. Basil McCrea took that to mean that such a review was the respons&shy;ibility  of the Local Government Boundaries Commis&shy;sioner, who can examine entire  council operations or parts of those councils. The commissioner&rsquo;s remit is not  restricted in the way that Basil McCrea understood it. He also said that there  were 50,000 people living in Enniskillen. There may be more than 60,000 people  in Fermanagh, but Enniskillen certainly does not have a population of 50,000.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The remit of the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner  is as stated in the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972, with which  I am sure Basil McCrea is very familiar. He referred to a previous Boundaries  Commissioner, but I am more interested in what the new commissioner will  deliver for local government. Basil McCrea then looked into his crystal ball,  and said that, geographically, and from a community point of view, people would  be ignored. I have no idea what the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner  will present to me, save that which falls within his or her terms of reference  as stated in schedule 4 of the 1972 Act. Basil McCrea obviously has some inside  knowledge of the new commissioner&rsquo;s intentions.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not accept Basil McCrea&rsquo;s contention that local government  does not do very much. He may be speaking for himself when he talks about not  doing very much, but there are a great many councillors in this country who do  a lot of work, and have carried the burden of this country for the past 35 to  40 years.</p>
