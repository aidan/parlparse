     <p class="B3BodyText">There is no point in MLAs coming to the Chamber to  criticise the decisions of boards or attempting to deflect their criticism of a  board&rsquo;s decision onto me as Minister, especially when they are members of the  political parties that are keeping the boards in place.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The boards are not an efficient mechanism for the  management or administration of our education services. The DUP and UUP  continue to block the establishment of the education and skills authority  (ESA), which has been designed to ensure that the maximum amount of money is  directed to front line services rather than the duplication of bureaucracy. The  education and skills authority has the potential to save up to &pound;20 million per  annum with strategic rather than piecemeal savings.</p>

It is to ensure that local needs are  identified and met that such roles and responsibilities are delegated to  education and library boards; they are best placed to direct funds to local  provision that most effectively meets the special educational needs of children  in their areas. It is a matter for the South Eastern Education and Library  Board to ensure that the special educational needs of children, including those  who attend the I CAN centre, are met, in line with the board&rsquo;s  responsibilities.</p>
