+	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: With permission, I wish to make a statement  about the Executive&rsquo;s decisions on the February monitoring round. This is the fourth and final monitoring round  of the 2007-08 financial year, and Members will b<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">e aware that the role and purpose of the in-year proce</span>ss <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">is to help the Executive to make the most of the  re</span>sources at their disposal. At the Executive&rsquo;s meeting on 28 February  2008, they decided on some reallocations of expenditure for the short time  remaining in the current financial year.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to note that this monitoring round  follows the departmental spring Supplementary Estimates, which were debated in  the Assembly on 12 February 2008. Departments are constrained by the spring  Supplementary Estimates and associated Budget Bill position, because no  allocation can be made in the February monitoring round above the position for  which legislative authority has been sought. The first stage in each monitoring  round is the identification by Departments  of resources allocated in previous Budget processes that, for a variety  of reasons, will not be spent in this financial year.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In overview terms, reduced requirements declared by  Departments in this monitoring round amount to &pound;51&middot;7 million in respect of current expenditure and &pound;61&middot;7  million in respect of capital investment. The level of reduced requirements  declared in this round is much greater than the levels that were identified at  the corresponding time in previous years. That continues the trend from the  previous monitoring round, with the result that the amount declared for this financial  year is some 41% greater than the reduced requirements that were declared last  year.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I commended Departments for the significant level  of reduced requirements identified as part of the December monitoring round,  the context for the February monitoring  round is quite different, because there is significantly less scope to  utilise the resources that become available in the February round than in  earlier ones. I, therefore, urge Departments to redouble their efforts, as we  move into the 2008-09 financial year, to  declare reduced requirements as early as possible in the year so that  the opportunity to redeploy funds into priority areas is not missed.</p>
