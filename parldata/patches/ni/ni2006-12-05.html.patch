 		  	<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses serious concern about the  potential of a seven council model to centralise services, remove jobs and  resources from many areas and to underpin sectarianism and community division;  and further calls on the Secretary of State to shelve present plans for super  councils and allow the decision on future council arrangements to be taken by a  restored Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is entirely ironic that, on the matter of the number of  councils, the only party to stand by the British Government with regard to  super-councils is Sinn F&eacute;in. It is particularly ironic, given that the leader  of Sinn F&eacute;in reminded everybody in the Assembly that it was the role of the  Northern Ireland Secretary of State and his predecessors to promote British  interests in Northern Ireland.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">For the record, Members are aware that I am a member of  Belfast City Council. As I listened to Tommy Gallagher, it was patently obvious  that he has not spoken or listened carefully to some of his party colleagues.  Two of them, Cllrs John O&rsquo;Kane and Dermot Curran, sit on the political panel,  which, as Members know, is at one end of the process of the Local Government  Taskforce. Tommy Gallagher says that he wants a 15-council model. However,  neither he nor any other Member has publicly or privately proffered a credible  explanation for a larger number of councils making sense.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I simply ask Tommy Gallagher, or any other Member who talks  about reducing the number of councils from 26 to 15, for example, to tell me  and the general public which councils they want to retain or abolish? Do they  want to retain Carrickfergus Borough Council? Tommy Gallagher should talk to  his colleague, who is Deputy Mayor of Castlereagh Borough Council. On what I  call a council league of shame, it has the worst under-representation of  Catholics in the workforce, at only 6&middot;8%. A similar disparity, both religious  and gender-based, exists in other council areas in the Six Counties. I want  anyone who argues for any particular configuration to provide a rationale for  doing so.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher also mentioned the argument surrounding the  rates burden.</p>

+		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>: Mr Maskey referred to percentages of  under-representation in the workforce. Can he give evidence from the Equality  Commission statistics to show where there is not equality of opportunity?</p>
 		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Maskey</strong>: I  am not here as a witness, and I do not have to give evidence. However, Members  will find that the recent Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ)  report provides a good indicator. My point  is that there is religious disparity in the workforce. Not only is there  Catholic under-representation, but the reverse is also the case in areas where  there is under-representation of the Protestant population in the work-force.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants a system of local government that ensures that such  under-representation does not happen in any district council area. From day  one, as Tommy Gallagher&rsquo;s colleagues on the Local Govern-ment Taskforce will  know, Sinn F&eacute;in has never been wedded to having a particular number of  councils.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In fact, Sinn F&eacute;in resisted it from the very early stages.  We were not prepared to plump for a figure of seven,  six, 15, 12, or 11 councils; we were not prepared to throw a dart and  choose a particular number because it sounded OK or because it might guarantee  a certain number of councillors. Much of the political debate has been driven  not by the number of councils but by the number of councillors. There are  parties that are afraid of having a serious reduction in their number of  councillors in the next election.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In 1999 or 2000 the previous Assembly endorsed the RPA. If  this motion succeeds, politically the work of  the RPA will be given back to the Assembly. That will mean that it will  have taken 10 years for the review to be completed, and many would argue that  it will be out of date. I see no reason why Members should defer this matter. Sean Begley and I worked at task force  level and on the political panel throughout the process. Based on that  personal experience, I do not have confidence that the other parties will get  to grips with the fundamental and serious issues that face us. We need to move  full speed ahead on the RPA to get a result soon. We need a fairer rates burden  and to have equality at the heart of local government, and when people are  elected they must not be treated as second-class citizens in the chambers and  the systems of local government.</p>

 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to declare an interest as a Member of Ballymoney  Borough Council, the second smallest of the 26 district councils. We heard a  lot this morning about identity, and in the very rural council area that I come  from it is vital that the issue of identity is not lost; it is important. I  have often said that, and I say it again. Take for example Lisnagunogue &mdash; and  if anyone wants to try and spell that, they will do a better job than me &mdash; in  my constituency of North Antrim. How relevant will a new super-council be to  that townland and hamlet? That is an issue that we cannot easily dismiss.</p>
 		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The current Government plan to reduce the number of local  councils from 26 to just seven would not only weaken local government, but also  make it more remote and unrepresentative of the needs of local communities. It  has another serious potential problem in that it could become the greatest  organisational blunder of the twenty-first century.</p>
