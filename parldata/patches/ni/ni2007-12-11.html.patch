+	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey:</strong> At the outset of  the debate I thought that there would not be any Christmas cheer, given the  position that we are in. However, it appears that there may be some light at the end of the tunnel, albeit on the basis  that what was certain last week is now uncertain. Sinn F&eacute;in has withdrawn and  is in the process of retreating &mdash; all the answers have become questions. We  know the reason for that: the Minister has realised that she has no chance of  getting her proposals through the legislative framework that was negotiated by  the DUP, limited and lacking in detail  though those proposals were. Whether her retreat is dignified,  discredited or disorderly, I assure the Minister that we will continue to  pursue her on the issues.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the Minister informed the House about what she has  done since she made her statement on 4 December 2007 &mdash; she has been having  talks about talks. We have had those in the past, and we have seen how little  value they have brought to the process.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In this Chamber last week, the Minister outlined what she  called her vision for the education system in Northern Ireland. Some of us might  suggest that the Minister had been eating too much cheese &mdash; Irish cheese, no  doubt &mdash; before she retreated for the night. Therefore,  instead of a vision, she came up with what my colleague Dominic Bradley  referred to as a nightmare. It is clear to even the most naive Members that the  Minister&rsquo;s commitment is not to strengthen or improve the education system, and  that her lack of competence to do a job that is far too big for her will be  harmful to our education system and, in  turn, harmful to our children.  No doubt there remain some on the Sinn F&eacute;in Benches, including the Minister&rsquo;s  defender Paul Butler, who would say that she is doing a good job no matter how  many gaffs she makes, or how many times she makes a complete hames of her job.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: Does the Member agree that Norther<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">n </span>Ireland students outscore their peers in England, Scotland and Wales,  and that lower-income families also outscore their peers across the  water? Does the Member also agree that it appears ludicrous to change the  system to something that will fail?</p>
