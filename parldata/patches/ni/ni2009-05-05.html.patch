       <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the range of measures that I have outlined,  I emphasise once again the most important message, which is that members of the  Northern Ireland  public should follow good hygiene practices. Those include regular hand  washing, using a clean tissue to cover mouth and nose when coughing or  sneezing, and remaining at home if people develop flu-like symptoms. Those are  simple, highly effective steps that every individual can take and that will  make a difference. That is why those messages have been reinforced in  advertisements running on television and radio. A leaflet providing further  advice and information for the public will be delivered to homes across Northern Ireland  from the end of this week.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I continue to receive full and detailed briefings on the  situation as it develops. I also have regular discussions with ministerial  colleagues in other UK Administrations and in the Republic of Ireland.  That has included daily meetings of COBRA, which is activated only in cases of  national emergency or crisis, or during events abroad that have major  implications for the UK.  Those meetings, which I attend, are chaired by Alan Johnston, Secretary of  State for Health in England,  and the Health Ministers for Wales  and Scotland  participate also.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that this issue is being taken seriously  by Governments, not just in Northern    Ireland but across the world. Internationally,  the World Health Organization is taking the lead in providing advice and  information on the ever-changing situation. At national level, the situation is  being managed through COBRA and the four home countries. Locally, the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Public Health  Agency and the health and social care service are in the lead. Daily updates on  the situation are issued to the media and to all Assembly Members. I will, of  course, report again to the Assembly if there are significant changes in the  current situation. In the meantime, Members can remain assured that we have the  necessary capability to respond to the swine flu virus. The Health Service is  well prepared, and I thank staff in the service for the commitment, support and  dedication that they have demonstrated in the face of a potential pandemic.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">I would also like to ask the Minister about the use of the  antiviral drug Tamiflu. In a previous statement, and at the Committee, the  Minister told us that the flu is susceptible to treatment by that drug. He said  that we have a sufficient stock of the drug and referred to the need to use that  stock very carefully.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I had understood that the drug was given only to people who  have flu-like symptoms and who may have been in contact with an infected  person. However, over the weekend, there were media reports about a confirmed case  of the flu at a school in London.  The school was closed as a result, and reports suggested that the 1,200  children at the school had all been treated with the Tamiflu antiviral drug as  a precaution. Will the Minister clarify whether that drug has preventative  qualities or whether it can be used only to treat symptoms?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The preventative measure comes  from a vaccine that is yet to be developed. Isolation of the virus seed will  allow the manufacturers to proceed with the development of that vaccine.  Discussions in that regard are ongoing between COBRA and the manufacturers.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">The battle is ongoing. The Spanish flu outbreak arrived  during the spring in the form of mild flu symptoms. It abated during the summer  and returned at its most destructive in the winter; that was its pattern. I am  not saying that it will be the same with swine flu. Spanish flu was an avian  virus, and swine flu is a mixture of avian, human and swine elements. However,  it could follow the same pattern, and we are planning for that eventuality. We  plan for the worst and hope for the best. We must do that, because come the autumn,  we may be facing the second wave of the virus.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his update on the situation &mdash; it is much  appreciated. I also thank him for all his hard work and that of colleagues in  anticipation of the arrival of swine flu. The work on the vaccine is also very  welcome. As the Minister said, who knows what will happen? The vaccine may be  needed later.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">What is the reaction of the Minister and his colleagues to  the World Health Organization&rsquo;s statement that it is not, at present,  considering a move to level 6, which is pandemic status?</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Security and Public Safety</strong>: The response is international,  national and local. The World Health Organization is responsible for the  international response. It took us from level 3 to level 5 rapidly, and we have  set responses as each of those levels is reached.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">The important message that the World Health Organization  gave is that, as yet, there will be no move to the pandemic level, which is  level 6. However, that should not be interpreted to mean that we should be  complacent. We must continue our preparations and be on our guard. Level 5  means that a pandemic is likely, but not inevitable. That is the current  situation. The world&rsquo;s best expert scientists and virologists cannot be certain  in their predictions. We deal only with probabilities and likelihoods.</p>

That is a standard practice that also  happens at George   Best Belfast   City Airport.  I thank the management of both airports for their help and co-operation.</p>

Has the Minister discussed them with the  Executive to secure the necessary resources? What is the shelf life of the  vaccine?</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Security and Public Safety</strong>: The shelf life of the vaccine is  limited to one year because the virus mutates annually. That is certainly the  case with the annual flu vaccine. Every year, we distribute hundreds of  thousands of units of the flu vaccine. Any that are not used are destroyed,  because the virus mutates. Viruses are very intelligent organisms and they  mutate constantly and, therefore, vaccines must change.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">As to the financial implications, the cost of purchasing the  vaccine &mdash; when it is available &mdash; will be considerable for Northern Ireland.  I do not want to put a figure on that today. Stockpiling antiviral drugs and  antibiotics will also cost a great deal. Furthermore, the effort that we put  into leafleting and expanding public awareness through advertising and the  provision of information will result in extraordinary expenditure that has not  been anticipated.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">However, none of that matters as long as we are prepared  properly and are ready for a pandemic, should it hit us. It is important that  we do everything possible to ensure that the population does not come to harm.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The establishment of the victims&rsquo; commissioners has  created a changing and evolving situation. Those people are charged with the  responsibility to carry out important work on behalf of victims, and they are  doing an excellent job at the moment. Part of their work is to establish a  victims&rsquo; forum, which the Department has asked to offer its views on the matter  that the Member raised. Thereafter, we will consider those views and attempt to  take the process forward.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I challenge everybody in the House to recognise the  importance of not using the issue as a political football. We all know and  understand that there is a lot of hurt on all sides of the community. Nearly  4,000 people lost their lives in the conflict. They came from all sections of  the community &mdash; the British Army, the IRA, loyalist groups and innocent  civilians. Any attempt to create a circumstance that further exacerbates  existing difficulties is a big mistake.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">For example, Gerard Donaghy was a member of the junior IRA,  Fianna &Eacute;ireann, who was murdered on Bloody Sunday by the British Parachute  Regiment. Where does he fit into the process? I use him as only one example.  Did his family even know that he was a member of the junior IRA? He was very  young at the time. Do we tell those people that they will not be treated with  respect and that they are regarded as not worthy? This process represents a  real challenge for us all.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">At the weekend, Mickey Bradley, who was shot by the British  Army on Bloody Sunday, died suddenly. He lived all his life with pain and  disability, hobbling around the streets of Derry  on crutches and sticks. For a long time, he campaigned for justice for those  who lost their lives. His approach included the fact that Gerard Donaghy, along  with all the other people who lost their lives, was an innocent marcher on the  day. This is a difficult issue, and there is a lot of pain out there. We must  be sensible about how we go forward. I appeal to people not to use the issue,  particularly in the context of an election, as a point-scoring exercise,  because that does a grave disservice to all victims.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I notice that the deputy First Minister used very selective examples of  victims. People outside the Chamber are listening carefully to what he has to  say on this matter, none less than the families of Patsy Gillespie and Frank  O&rsquo;Hegarty. One of them was made into a human bomb, and the other was promised a  safe passage on his return to Derry only to be  found dead within a short time frame, much to the regret of his mother and  father.</p>
