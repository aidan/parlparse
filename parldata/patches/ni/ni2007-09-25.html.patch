 	        <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to highlight the  fact that it took a considerable time for a Sure Start group that I am  involved with to make leasing arrangements with education and library boards  and, after we had a building, to get staff. It takes time for such actions to  bed in. Sufficient time must be given to determine whether the results are  satisfactory. I hope that sufficient time will be given, so that the positive  work of that scheme can be seen to bear fruit.</p>

Government must assist people to improve their children&rsquo;s lot, to give them  better educational attainment and  qualifications and, ultimately, to contribute to the economy. In that  way, they will rise from their situation of poverty. I hope that funding will  continue to be available to enable some of the most deprived children in our  communities to reach a better level of attainment.</p>

 	        <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister, I welcome the opportunity to debate  this most important issue. In this day and age, the level of child poverty in Northern Ireland  is deplorable and unacceptable.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics paint a very depressing picture. In recent  questions for written answer, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy  First Minister said that in 2002-03, approximately 26%, or 114,000 children,  were living in relative income poverty. Although the figure was slightly reduced in 2004-05 to approximately 24%, or  101,000 children, the numbers are alarming.</p>

As I said earlier, I hope to have action next year  with regard to driver disqualification. Unfortunately, I cannot give Mr Attwood  a timescale in relation to penalty points. I am sure that he would be the first  to bring me before the House if I did not keep to that timescale. However, he  can rest assured that my officials and I will continue to push on the matter,  because we want it settled as quickly as possible. We shall await the outcome  of the feasibility study and take it from there.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard conflicting arguments concerning the billboards.  Some people see them as a distraction on the roads; others say that they are  useful reminders that people should take care on particular stretches of road.  The Department closes its eyes to nothing that comes before it, and the  suggestion will be examined in the review.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">Implicit in Mr Attwood&rsquo;s question about an all-Ireland road safety body was the fact that good,  effective work is ongoing.
