     <p class="H4StageHeading">Justice</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice of an urgent oral question to the Minister of Justice.  Given the subject matter, I have agreed that a representative from each party  will be given an opportunity to ask a supplementary question.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Lord Morrow asked the Minister of Justice, in light of  his recent statement that indicated there were five clerical errors by the NI  Courts and Tribunals Service in relation to the McDermott case including one in  relation to the sexual offences prevention order which stated the duration was  for five years rather than for life, if he can assure the Assembly that there  are no further discrepancies or clerical errors by the Courts and Tribunals  Service that could place the public at immediate risk; and if he can further  assure the Assembly that every step possible is being taken to review urgently  all sexual offences prevention orders and to ensure that this situation does  not arise again.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: First, I wish to take the opportunity in the Chamber to  restate the apology that I have already made elsewhere to the survivors in the  McDermott case. I deeply regret that the way in which that information came to  light has added to their distress.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, I have recently written to the  Justice Committee to advise it of the outcome of the urgent review that I  instructed the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service to undertake of  its administrative processes in the McDermott case and a review of all  supervision and treatment orders. That review identified that several errors  were made in the McDermott case and that an error was made in the STO of a  separate case. Details of those errors and the proposed remedial action are set  out in a report that has been made available to the Justice Committee and that  I have placed in the Assembly Library. The relevant court records are being  corrected, and amended orders will be issued as soon as possible following the  approval of the trial judge.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise, however, that, although it is clearly  unacceptable that they occurred, those errors did not place the public at any  immediate risk. The defendants in that case are subject to the requirements of  supervision and treatment orders and sexual offences prevention orders as  imposed by the courts, together with the notification requirements under the  Sexual Offences Act 2003. The terms of the orders were stated in the sentencing  judgment issued by the judge and were made available to the prosecution, the  defence and the trust&rsquo;s representatives. That was the order of the court, and  the errors in the administrative processes had no material impact on the legal  effect of the orders. It is accepted, however, that the orders issued by the  court office were wrong and may have led to inaccurate case records being held  by the relevant agencies.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">The administrative errors that arose in the Courts and  Tribunals Service, which I put down in a statement that is in the <strong>Assembly Library and which was given to the  Committee for Justice yesterday, were simply that</strong>: administrative errors.  They had no material consideration in any way on the McDermott case.  Undoubtedly, the way in which they have been publicised has added to the  confusion and distress of the survivors of the McDermott family. I deeply  regret that, but they did not affect the outcome of the case.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: A supervision and  treatment order and a sexual offences prevention order are in place. They work  together to ensure the safety of children and the community and to ensure that  the McDermott brothers receive appropriate treatment.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The sexual offences prevention order is the responsibility  of the police and ensures the safety of children and the public. The  supervision and treatment order was issued to the Western Health and Social  Care Trust by the court. The responsibility of the supervising officer in  accordance with that order is to approve or disapprove residency. Should the brothers  decide to leave Lakeview and return to Donagh or go elsewhere, the supervising  officer would discuss any change of circumstances with other relevant agencies  and approve or disapprove whatever address they present, according to the  evidence before the supervising officer at the time.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">On legal advice, the trust has not applied for any  variation to the supervision and treatment order, as the brothers are compliant  with the terms of that order. Should that change, the trust will take  appropriate action, in conjunction with the police and the responsibilities in  relation to the sexual offences prevention order.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The last Member who spoke referred to our reluctance to support the amendment.  It is with some regret that we cannot support the amendment. Indeed, had the  amendment been a wee bit more explicit and direct, there would have been no  reason why we on these Benches would not have supported it. I ask the House to  take cognisance of the fact that the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment makes no mention  whatsoever of the United Kingdom Government. It is, however, very specific in  stating that the Minister of Justice should work closely with:</p>
     <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Irish Government and the European Union to ensure  that Northern Ireland is part of an all-island, European wide response to this  serious issue.&rdquo;</p>
     <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Had the SDLP stopped and thought its way forward  and sought to unite the House around an amendment, I have no doubt that that  would have happened. I appeal to the SDLP, even at this late stage, to think  again on the amendment and support the motion tabled by Tom Elliott, David  McNarry and Mr Kinahan. In the main, the House agrees with the motion. If we  continue to try to politicise every issue in Northern Ireland, whether it comes  from one side or the other, we will lose sight of the real issues, and that  would be regrettable, given the gravity of this matter.</p>
-    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The previous Member  to speak said something that is very true</strong>: we will be judged on how the  situation works out on the ground. That is exactly how we will be judged. We  will not be judged on the fine words or the fine politicking that was brought  in either to confuse or score a couple of silly, cheap, political points over  political opponents.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">The briefing paper said that trafficking happens mainly in  Belfast, and that is probably true, but it goes on to say that <strong>places such as Londonderry and Newry are  also noted for having the problem. However, the problem goes much further</strong>:  it goes into our provincial towns.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I work closely with the PSNI in my town, and I congratulate  them on the fine work that they have done, albeit it very slowly. Nevertheless,  eventually we got a satisfactory result. It was patently obvious that  trafficking was going on in houses of ill repute, which is the only way that I  can put it. However, through the tedious, hard work of the local PSNI, we were  able to bring that to a conclusion. Many neighbours who had made representation  to me and, I suspect, to others, were in despair at times due to the length of  time it took to close down those establishments.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the House to support the motion, as it is an honest  attempt to get to the heart of the problem. Human trafficking is a totally  distasteful business &mdash; there is no other word that I would want to put on it &mdash;  that feeds criminal activity and destroys the lives of the individuals who are  subject to the illegal trades. Human trafficking exists because of greed and  power. However, I understand the sentiment expressed in the motion, because  without a demand for prostitution and drugs, there would be no trade.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise for not being in the  Chamber at the outset of the debate, but I was on other Assembly business.  Thank you for your indulgence in calling me to speak this afternoon. I have, of  course, heard some of the debate, and I have been very impressed. I thank all  the Members who brought forward the motion and the amendment, and I want to add  my voice of support to the motion as amended. The amendment is a logical  follow-on. Mark Durkan made the point adequately that it is just a logical  extension to the work that is advocated in the motion.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">A number of PSNI officers travelled to Brussels to speak to  the European Commission and Members of the European Parliament about this  matter. Indeed, my colleague Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, who is an MEP, and I met a number  of officers to discuss what might be done by way of engagement with Brussels. That  speaks for itself. Obviously, the officers represent the PSNI, which is charged  with trying to eradicate the trade. They are anxious that we work to address  the problem of human trafficking and exploitation, not exclusively in the  North, but on a cross-border and, indeed, a transnational basis. Therefore, I  support the amendment strongly.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to point out that no more than a couple of  years ago, prior to Operation Pentameter, the PSNI said publicly, and privately  to Policing Board members, that it did not consider that there was any  discernable human-trafficking problem. That is interesting. Thankfully, the  PSNI has been proactive in addressing the problem that exists. I want to put on  record that I welcome its recent activities to track down those who are  responsible for human trafficking. As has already been pointed out by Members  in the Chamber, a number of men, women and children have been rescued from that  dreaded trade. It is important to acknowledge that work is ongoing. Clearly,  human trafficking has been exposed as an iniquitous trade that is being  practiced on our very doorsteps. It is a public scandal that, in this day and  age, that type of activity is happening in our cities, towns and villages.</p>
-    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Tom Elliott is  correct</strong>: it is important that the practice is exposed rather than brushed  under the carpet or somehow kept hidden. It is crucial that, as the motion  states, awareness of human trafficking is raised among the public. All those  who are deemed to be involved in that trade must be brought to book. It is  important to acknowledge the good work that is being done to support people who  are rescued from that trade, although much more is needed. Some work is already  under way to help them to overcome that trauma, pick up the pieces of their  lives, and deal with the consequences. We understand that many of those people  face stark and difficult choices, not least because they must deal with threats  to their families in other countries.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I support the motion and the amendment. I appeal  to Members to do likewise despite whatever minor technical issues might be  drawn to their attention. The essence of the issue is that a shocking trade is  going on under our noses in our towns and villages, and all around us. It is  simply unthinkable that that type of trade is being practised and people are  being trafficked and victimised in that manner in 2010.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">We must do everything we can to bring the matter to public  attention and raise awareness. In particular, the message must reach people who  want to avail themselves of those so-called services, whom Mark Durkan  described as &ldquo;end-users&rdquo;. Clearly, there is a great deal of responsibility on  their shoulders. If they are aware, in any way, that people are being coerced  into certain roles, they are guilty of serious crimes. Undoubtedly, they must  also be brought to book.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all people who are anxious to bring that trade to  public attention and, more importantly, to tackle it and to rescue people from  trafficking. The full rigours of the law must be brought to bear on all who are  engaged in such nefarious activity.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Minister explain the rationale for an in-year reduction in the budget  allocation to GPs? Does he believe that GPs can stand that budget reallocation  without any reduction in front line service?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as GPs are concerned, I  regret having to make any such reductions. However, we are faced with cuts laid  on to us by the Executive. For example, cuts from swine flu: I asked for &pound;42  million and got &pound;5 million, so there is a cut. In addition, my pro rata share  of the so-called black hole is &pound;113 million. That all adds up to a need to make  reductions.</p>
