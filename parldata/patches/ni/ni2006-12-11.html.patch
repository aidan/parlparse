   		<p class="B3BodyText">The process of consultation has already come in for some  criticism in this House &mdash; and rightly so. The IRMP consultation over the past  three years could not be described as widespread, or well informed. If the  imperative is to have a public consultation process, an equal imperative is  that that process is transparent and accountable. Comments from the Fire  Brigades Union describe the process to date as a sham, used to endorse  strategic decisions that have been taken in advance of consultation by senior  Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) managers. If that is the case,  it is to be regretted, and it is something that this House should not endorse.</p>
   		<p class="B3BodyText">As a former member of the Fire Authority for Northern  Ireland, I can say that we should be proud of the local Fire and Rescue  Service. Too often it is the Cinderella of the emergency services and fails to  get the recognition and resources that it deserves.</p>
   		<p class="B3BodyText">This is an issue that should not be used as a political  football. It is an issue that should unite all the parties in this House,  because the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service has, throughout the  difficulties that the Province has faced, been at the forefront of ensuring the  safety of residents. I wish to place on record our appreciation of the work of  the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service through 35 years of terrorism  wreaked upon the Province and supported by some Members in the House. We  welcome the fact that, belatedly, those Members are coming to support it.</p>
