     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise the House of a change of business. Ms Dawn Purvis is unwell and will  not move the Final Stage of the Local Government (Disqualification) Bill, which  will be rescheduled by the Business Committee. A valid petition of concern was  received yesterday in relation to the Final Stage of the Bill.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  My party welcomes the Final Stage of this very important piece of legislation.  It has been in development for over three years, and we are pleased at the  level of input from more than 400 older people, as well as 10 written evidence  submissions to the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister and oral evidence submissions from five organisations. The We  Agree campaign&rsquo;s aim and objectives have been supported by approximately 2,500  people and 120 organisations. This is a prime example of how devolution is  working for the people of Northern    Ireland, because it shows that local people  are influencing local legislation.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">That is to be welcomed, and I am pleased that the  legislation is coming into its final stages and will put the new commissioner  in place. Imagine how long the process would have taken under direct rule; it  does not bear thinking about.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said that, over the next 15 years, one quarter  of our population will be over the age of 60. That is proportionally higher  than anywhere else in the United    Kingdom. It is, therefore, essential that we  build a framework in our society whereby older people can continue to  participate in employment and have access to benefits such as pension credit  and access to further and higher education. My staff in my constituency office  work hard to ensure that older people who come in receive all the benefits to  which they are entitled. More often than not, older people are not aware of  what they can claim, and the Commissioner for Older People can and will ensure  that the level of benefit take-up is increased.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">In these difficult economic times, many people may question  the cost and value of another commissioner, especially when there has been much  discussion on the number of quangos and arm&rsquo;s-length bodies that already exist  in Northern Ireland.  However, according to figures released by Age Northern Ireland, the estimated  annual cost is &pound;1&middot;5 million. Considering that there are 290,000 older people in  Northern Ireland,  the cost is less than 2p per older person per day. That is a small price to pay  and is excellent value not just for the older population but for all of us as  we age. Improving the position of older people will deliver better outcomes for  us all now and in the future.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Age Northern    Ireland and other voluntary sector  organisations receive thousands of calls every year and often tackle the same  problems over and over again. The commissioner will be able to tackle the root  cause of such problems by using powers of investigation and review. Common  issues can be resolved more efficiently by the commissioner making  recommendations on policy and practice that, in turn, will be implemented by  the various relevant agencies. The commissioner could have a duty to engage  older people and thus give them an opportunity to contribute to the process.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, it is highly unlikely that we would be  at this point if we did not have a devolved Government through which people  have the power to shape and influence policy and decision-making. Age Northern  Ireland has given some examples of situations where it would be appropriate for  an older person&rsquo;s commissioner to step in, such as: access to transport, where  people are entitled to free bus passes but where there is inconsistent  provision of rural and community transport; lack of benefit take-up, where  there is potential for improvement if automatic payments of pension credit are  introduced; the withdrawal of age-based concessionary fees in employment and  learning would be another major step forward; variation in nutritional  standards for meals on wheels; and the malnutrition of older people in  hospitals.</p>
