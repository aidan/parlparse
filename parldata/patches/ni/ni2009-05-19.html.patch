     <p class="B3BodyText">The solution to that situation is to keep children out of  the criminal justice system by ensuring that we do all that we can to keep them  away from offending behaviour. There must be a greater emphasis on early  intervention, alternatives to formal prosecution and sentencing, support for  families and young people in crisis, and community-based diversion and  activities for young people. We also need to see more intervention when young  people are in custody to prevent the revolving-door syndrome, where people come  out and go straight back in again. We also need to be honest about the role of  the education system in alienating young people. If a child is told at the age  of 11 that not much is expected of him or her, which course do we expect them  to choose, further education or further rejection?</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">On my recent visit to Bangor,  I heard from a number of young people that the education that they received in  custody was the best that they had ever encountered. Learning disabilities,  dyslexia and dyspraxia were diagnosed and dealt with, and children received  education at a level and in subjects that kept them interested and encouraged  them to progress.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and hope that the Executive will work  quickly to address those concerns.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">I have serious reservations about the entire criminal  justice system. There is a perception in our community and society that people  are not justly punished for their crimes. There is a complete focus on the rights  of the people who perpetrate crimes, and little focus or regard for the victims  of crimes.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Those people deserve a voice. Seventy per cent of the  juvenile offenders who serve custodial sentences reoffend. The issue is that if  we try to change the juvenile justice system by saying that people should not  be put in prison, we are saying to society that &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">I have serious concerns about diluting the definition of  special educational needs. I could have a little sympathy for the Minister &mdash;  believe it or not &mdash; in that she inherited the problem. Children with special  educational needs were not treated fairly or appropriately before she took  office. We saw that when the South Eastern Education and Library Board was  stood down because it was given insufficient funding to meet the circumstances  of children with special educational needs and commissioners were brought in to  cut services. Unfortunately, the Minister, who has been in office for two  years, has kept the commissioners and has not brought the board back, which  would have had a degree of public accountability. She has endorsed what was  done by the direct rule Minister, who brought in commissioners to make cuts for  children with special educational needs.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">We do not have adequate funding for children with special  educational needs. Additional funding has been given to the Minister to deal  with the issue, and now the Minister wants to broaden the scope.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">There is nothing in the current assessment process that  would preclude any of those children from being identified as having special  educational needs. Ms Ramsey wants a broad-brush approach applied, so that  everyone in that group would be classified as having special educational needs.  I find that grossly insulting and wholly inappropriate.
