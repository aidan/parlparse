       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response. What discussions, if any, has she had with her  counterpart in the Republic   of Ireland to address the  post-2013 issues, given that we are on one island and that, in the past, we  have had irregularities North and South about the way forward?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The CAP affects all farmers across the island of Ireland. Therefore, it makes sense for  both Departments to co-operate closely on the issue. Given that farmers North  and South have common interests, I am of the view that we should have frequent  discussions on our policy approach.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">On issues where there is agreement, there are opportunities  to collaborate in attempting to influence the Commission&rsquo;s position, and I  intend to use any avenue that is open to me in trying to get the best deal for  farmers in the North. However, in every discussion that I have with the  Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, CAP reform is on the agenda, and  we have frequently talked about how that affects farmers across the island of Ireland.</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Along with colleagues in Scotland and Wales,  I will do my best to influence Westminster.  At times, I feel sorry for English farmers because DEFRA&rsquo;s position is not very  sympathetic to them. My Department, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Wales, has a divergent view from  that of DEFRA, and that is to the benefit of farmers.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">A reform of the CAP is not widely supported across Europe, and the South, for example, is discussing its  position on the CAP with other member states. DEFRA seems to be out of kilter  with many of the other member states on the issue.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Does the Minister think that it would be a mistake for the single farm payment  to become a flat-rate system across the European Union?</p>
