 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  My apologies. A hushed House will now hear a calm question. Does the Member  accept that everyone in the House wants to see action for newly qualified  teachers as quickly as possible, which does not require a huge debate and is  something that the Assembly should get on with?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  If the Curran Report is introduced into the equation, huge debate will be  necessary. If we are to address the matter we must do so in the context of  resources, whether the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP or anybody else likes  it.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">If amendment No 1 were to be made, it should be noted that the amended motion would be calling  for the Curran Report&rsquo;s recommendations to be implemented in full. As I  have pointed out, if that were to happen, the majority of resources that the  amended motion would be demanding from the  Minister would go not to newly qualified teachers but to the teaching  profession in general. That is OK for someone who lives in an unrealistic world  in which the infantile economics that some Ulster Unionist Members talked about operate: the &ldquo;Gimme, gimme, gimme&rdquo; stance.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The work that classroom assistants do cannot be counted in  pounds. That work has not been recognised either  in the past or by the Chamber today.

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Minister of Education needs to go the extra mile  and ensure that extra funding to resolve the dispute for once and for all &mdash; not  the &pound;30 million that has been spoken of for umpteen years &mdash;is made available?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  The Member must be reading my mind, as that is what I had intended to say. I  have a two-page speech, but I am so angry  that I feel that what I have written is totally inadequate.</p>

My advice to the Minister is that if she goes the extra mile, she  will address that issue and provide the best education for our children.  Otherwise, the children who attend our schools will lose out.</p>

The issue has not gone away. It will not go away. Classroom assistants  deserve what they are asking for. They should be given what they are asking  for.</p>
