 		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for his  assessment of the implications of the recent credit problems and general global  economic slow down for the economic targets and growth strategy set out in the  Programme for Government; if there will be any change in the  economic-development aims and strategy resulting from the changed economic  environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO3461>(AQO 3461/08)</a></p>

I have commented on those issues in the House and in  the media. The economic priorities and targets set out in the Programme for  Government were framed in the context of the global economic slowdown and the  uncertainties in the financial markets.

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the targets will be continually tracked and monitored  against changing markets, and, where appropriate, they will be amended over the  current Programme for Government period.</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  am reminded of what it is like to be at school, and I do not mean as a teacher.  Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that you will allow me to congratulate the Minister  and his associates on the organisation of the US investment conference.  Everything possible was done to make the conference a success. In the light of  the international pressures that have been mentioned, what signals on  prospective investment here did the Minister get from those who attended the  conference?</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am very grateful to the honourable Member for his comments.  It is only right to record our gratitude and thanks to everybody who put in  such an enormous amount of time and effort over many months to make the conference  the success that it was. Members of the House, Committee members and others  played an important role. The feedback has been very positive, but the hard work  to ensure that something tangible is delivered from that conference begins now.  I believe that it will be.</p>
