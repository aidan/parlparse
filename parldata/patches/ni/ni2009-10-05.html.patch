     <p class="B3BodyText">We acknowledge the strain on our head teachers, which is  due to excessive bureaucracy, red tape and overheads and which detracts from  their ability to do the job that they want to do. We agree about the iniquity  of funding delays that lead to schools not being built on time, and we know  about the financing challenges. I guess that we even agree about maximising  autonomy where possible at school level, if that is a school&rsquo;s wish.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">So where does the problem lie? If we agree on all those  issues, why is it not possible to get together and resolve them? The Ulster  Unionist Party has identified four issues, which it puts on the table in the  hope that the House will consider them and resolve to address them. There is a  difference of opinion about cause and effect. In the past, the Minister has  argued that the 11-plus, transfer test or whatever terminology one wishes to  use causes social inequalities and that it is iniquitous and unfair. There are  other arguments, not least of which is that the tests do not create inequalities,  rather, they reflect inequalities.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr Bradley for bringing that matter up. In fact, I rather  hoped to engender some warmth between the UUP and the SDLP, because these are  devolved matters that we must discuss and find a solution to.</p>
