       <p class="H5StageHeading">Action Mental Health Vote</p>
       <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  outline the reasons behind the decision to withdraw funding, from 1 April 2010,  from Action Mental Health Vote project in the Craigavon and Banbridge area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 4/10<a name="AQO4/10"></a>)</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The decision to withdraw funding  from the Action Mental Health vote project was made by the Southern Health and  Social Care Trust. The trust provided funding for 30 places on the project, but  only 15 of those were taken up by trust clients. The service was not fully  utilised by trust clients, so the trust has therefore decided to provide  individualised services for its clients.</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo; Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for that answer.  The scheme, although it may not have been used by trust clients, is a very  effective and efficient one. It is there to provide individual learning courses  to 16- to 25-year-olds with learning difficulties in the Craigavon and  Banbridge area. The scheme levers in &pound;178,000 of funding from other sources. On  many occasions, sometimes quite correctly, the Minister has complained that his  Department does not have enough funding. Surely a scheme that attracts &pound;178,000  of other funding should be supported by the trust and the Department.</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The point to stress is the one  that I made in the original answer. Although the trust provided 30 places, only  15 were taken up, not all of those by clients who have learning disabilities;  some were taken up by clients with learning difficulties. The Member will  understand that the trust is responsible for the first of those two groups. We  have to spend our money in areas that we are responsible for. I take the point  that the service is valuable. It is offered to 18- to 20-year-olds, individuals  who are at an important transitional period in their lives. However, if the  trust pays for 30 places and only 15 are taken up, that obviously does not fit  the demand that the trust has identified. The trust will now provide funding  for clients on an individual basis.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I also make the point that the Health Service funds almost  &pound;1 million of transition services throughout Northern Ireland, so it is not a  one-off, stand-alone service. We recognise the need for transition services,  but sadly, for whatever reason, that particular service is not getting the  necessary support.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am also familiar with that project. Will the Minister assure the House that  there was proper promotion of the service and that it was not the case that  places were not taken up because people did not know about it because their key  workers had not referred them to it?</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, if one looks at the Omagh judgement, one can see  that the defendants, although they were sued individually, were sued also as an  unincorporated association that was identified as the Real Irish Republican  Army. At least two of the defendants were sued on their own behalf and as  representing that organisation. Therefore, theoretically, the option is open to  people to sue the IRA. It is probably a practical impossibility, given that we  do not know who members of the IRA were. If there were known representatives,  they could be sued. In that sense, people could claim compensation if assets  were forthcoming.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are dealing with theoretical possibilities. It  is right and proper that justice be shown to the victims of IRA, UDA &mdash;</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I thank Members who have contributed to the debate. I will not deal with all the  comments that were made, but I will respond to some of them.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that Sinn F&eacute;in, even if it cannot support  the motion, did not take the opportunity afforded by the debate to acknowledge,  at least, wrongdoing against the victims who are taking the case &mdash; wrongdoing  that they have suffered, and are seeking compensation for. That is regrettable,  because it does not move us on, as the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Mr  Elliott and others pointed out.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in instead presented us with the usual  &ldquo;whataboutery&rdquo;. We were quoted statistics about killings by the army, police  and others. I did not want to reduce the debate to that level, but I will deal  with it. In reality, the Provisional IRA killed considerably more people in the  Troubles than the police and the army put together. They were responsible for  almost 50% of all murders during the Troubles, including many murders of Roman  Catholic civilians.</p>
