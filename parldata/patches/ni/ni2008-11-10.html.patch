 	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. I congratulate her for increasing the  amount of money that is available for co-ownership. Is there any other way in  which she can encourage the Co-Ownership Housing Association to invest more  money through private funding from the banks and other lending organisations?</p>
 	    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Co-Ownership Housing Association should discuss  that issue with its lender, but I will provide some information. Since  devolution, the number of people with loans who are in the co-ownership scheme  has increased by 25%. In September 2008, that numbered 4,039 people, compared  with 3,242 at the beginning of April 2007. A record amount of more than &pound;80  million was spent in 2007-08, which helped in excess of 920 households. Co-ownership  is on course to deliver the target of 500 homes this year, and support for  co-ownership has increased dramatically since the restoration of devolution.  The facts are available, and they speak for themselves.</p>
