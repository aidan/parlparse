     <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">Published at 2.00 pm on &nbsp;Thursday 16 September, 2010</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: F&aacute;ilte romhaimh.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to advise Assembly Members on the future of a DARD  advisory NDPB, the Research and Education Advisory Panel, known as REAP.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">REAP was established in 2005 in response to one of the  recommendations of the independent O&rsquo;Hare Review of the arrangements for  agri-food education and research and development in the north of Ireland. Its  role, as set out in its Terms of Reference, is to provide independent expert  advice on DARD&rsquo;s research, education and knowledge transfer policies.</p>

+    <p class="B3BodyText">The Review</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In line with best practice in the management of public  bodies and an earlier commitment to DFP, I commissioned an independent review  of REAP and our interaction with it in 2008.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The review examined the rationale for an independent  advisory panel, taking account of the wider political and strategic context;  the most appropriate model for that advice, as well as the Panel&rsquo;s performance.  The review was completed in consultation with the REAP membership, DARD  officials and a range of stakeholders. It also drew on the experience of a  range of comparable advisory bodies in Scotland,  England and the south of Ireland. I am  grateful to those who contributed to the review and helped me reach the  decision I am announcing today.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The review acknowledged that REAP had been very productive.  The Panel provided valuable scrutiny and input to the development of the DARD  Evidence and Innovation Strategy which was well received by the research and  wider stakeholder community. REAP also contributed to our thinking on the  processes needed to commission, manage and quality assure DARD&rsquo;s substantial  research programme. Finally, the Panel has also indirectly influenced our  current approach to stakeholder engagement in developing other policies.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The review concluded that DARD still required independent  expert advice on its research and education functions; that the existing panel  should be formally stood down and a new panel launched later that year. It also  made a number of more detailed recommendations on the future structure,  operation and reporting arrangements for any new panel.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Following receipt of the report, I accepted the  recommendation to stand down the existing panel but indicated my intention to  consider further the review findings further before announcing a final decision  on the way forward.</p>

+    <p class="B3BodyText">Changes in Strategic Environment</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Not unexpectedly,  the strategic environment for DARD&rsquo;s research and education policies has  evolved very considerably since REAP&rsquo;s launch in 2005. In April 2006, we  created a Non Public Departmental Body, the Agri-food Biosciences Institute to  provide scientific research and services to government, non-governmental and  commercial organisations. This was also one of the recommendations of the  independent O&rsquo;Hare Review. In addition, in February 2009, we appointed our  first Departmental Scientific Adviser and our Evidence and Innovation Strategy,  published in July 2009, is beginning to drive the DARD research agenda. We have  also established new internal structures for commissioning and managing  DARD-funded research which provide for increased engagement between  policy-makers, research organisations and stakeholders in identifying research  needs, setting priorities and ensuring effective knowledge exchange. DARD is  also strengthening its relationship with other research funders in Britain through various mechanisms, and we are  also planning to explore the potential for further cooperation with the south  of Ireland  on research.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, a number of cross-government strategic reviews  of skills and innovation have concluded recently and new structures, such as  MATRIX and the Food Industry Advisory panel have been established which will  help guide the Executive&rsquo;s support for industry in these areas. At the same  time, DEL is consulting on a revised Skills  Strategy for the north of Ireland,  which will provide the overarching policy context within which DARD education  policy must fit. And, of course, we also have the benefit of Lantra and Improve,  the respective Sector Skills Councils for the land based and food industries,  to provide policy input and advice on skills needs.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Finances must also be a consideration, both for any revised  body and the associated secretariat support. The Executive faces the  significant budget pressures over the course of the coming four years and we  will all have to make difficult choices about spending priorities.</p>
