       <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that, when I announced my proposals  for health and social care reform in the House on 18 February 2008, it  triggered a major consultation exercise, which lasted until 12 May 2008. During  that consultation process, the Department was actively involved in engaging  with key stakeholders to discuss the proposals in greater detail and to canvass  their views. Having listened carefully to the views of stakeholders and of  interested parties, it was decided that the overall quality and safety agenda  should come under the ownership of the public health agency.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">As the provisions in the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001  relate to the registration of midwives to practice in an area of work that  clearly falls within the quality and safety agenda, it makes sense that the  registration responsibility should rest with the public health agency, as that  is where the director of nursing will be based.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Members will also be aware that the Health and Social Care  (Reform) Act (Northern    Ireland) 2009 was subject to rigorous  scrutiny during its passage through the Assembly. It was very encouraging to  see the widespread acceptance of the proposals in the legislation and the level  of consensus that it enjoyed in the Health Committee and in the House. Given  that midwives will now be required to provide notification of their intention  to practice to the public health agency, it is necessary to amend schedule 4 to  the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 to reflect that position.</p>

It is a short and straightforward Order that relates to the  registration of midwives. From 1 April 2009, when the new health and social  care bodies come into operation, midwives will be required to register with the  new Regional Agency for Public Health and Social Well-being.</p>

I support the motion.</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 1,  9 and 10 together.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">Almost 10,000 applications for the programme have been  received. Given that the budget for this tranche of funding is &pound;6 million, it  is not financially possible for the Department to fund all the applications.  The total cost of funding all the applications would be in the region of &pound;40  million, and it is anticipated that approximately 1,100 will receive grant aid.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The farm modernisation scheme is an integral part of the  rural development programme, which was approved by the European Commission in  July 2007. EU rules required us to establish selection criteria for the scheme,  and those were finalised in October 2008. My officials considered that the scheme  met all relevant EU legislation, and I remain of that opinion.</p>
