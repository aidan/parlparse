 	        Trade and Business Development Sectoral Meeting</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South Ministerial  Council (NSMC) trade and business development sectoral meeting. Before  proceeding, I advise Members that I understand that neither this statement, nor  the next that the Minister will deliver today, relates to agricultural or rural  development matters. I remind Members again that the questions that follow the  statement must relate to its subject matter.</p>

The Irish Government were represented by Miche&aacute;l  Martin TD, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and by Dr Jimmy Devins TD, Minister of  State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department  of Education and Science. The statement has been agreed by Minister Dodds, and  I am making it on behalf of us both.</p>

Dr Dobbin and  the chief executive of InterTradeIreland presented a progress report on the  work that has been carried out by the body since the previous NSMC trade and  business development sectoral meeting, which was held in June 2002.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Examples of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s work include the recent  launch of the entrepreneurship network and masterclass programme, and in the  area of design, the organisation is scoping the potential for co-operative  initiatives that will deliver competitiveness benefits. It is also examining  co-operation with other industries and the private sector in order to explore  the potential for initiatives on environmental goods and services.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">For my part, parity has been an important aspect of social  security provision across the United    Kingdom since the late 1940s. Social  security is formally devolved to the Assembly, but, given our society&rsquo;s  relevant dependency and the number of people who receive benefits, it is in the  interests of the people of Northern    Ireland not only to retain but to further  entrench the principle of parity. It is important that the parties,  particularly those on the Executive, take a collective view on where we are  heading on the issue of parity and that we do not continue to send out mixed  messages. I am sure that the Minister for Social Development will concur with  that.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, the Committee will have detailed comments to  make, which I look forward to hearing. The Alliance Party is broadly supportive  of the legislation, but we note that it is an extremely limited piece of  legislation that has been brought forward after considerable delay. We are not  sure what the justification for that delay has been.</p>

Has the enormous power that  has been held by absentee landlords since 1604 been addressed? Will that be a  critical element in the development of tourism and angling in the future?</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 12 March 2008, the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister was briefed by OFMDFM on the proposals for  the draft Public Authorities (Reform) Bill. The proposals for the Bill had been  subject to public consultation in January 2007. It was originally proposed that  the Bill would make changes to a small number of public bodies, either through  dissolution or a transfer of functions, and that it would remove statutory  nomination and consultation rights from several public bodies.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Following public consultation, the scope of the Bill was  significantly reduced. In particular, a decision was made to retain the Housing  Council and to leave provisions for statutory nominations as they are. The  Bill, as introduced, simply seeks to transfer the functions of the Fisheries  Conservancy Board to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and to abolish  the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board for Northern Ireland, with its  functions being delivered by a UK-wide disability living allowance advisory  board. The Bill also includes several repeals of primary legislation, which  relate to organisations that have already been abolished, such as Enterprise Ulster,  the pig production development committee and Laganside Corporation.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the Committee meeting on 12 March, members raised  several issues with officials from OFMDFM. In particular, concern was expressed  at the limited progress that has been made to reduce the number of  quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations (quangos) in Northern Ireland.  The original RPA proposals indicated that the number of quangos would be  reduced from 81 to 53. However, on 31 March 2008, the Committee was advised  that a total of eight decisions to abolish quangos had been reversed and that  decisions are pending on the abolition of another 10 quangos.</p>

At present, it has places for a  maximum of 10 adults and a waiting list of six adults who require special-needs  support. The current special-needs facility is a 23-year-old Portakabin.

The  amount of money that is paid to the centre increases each year. The centre uses  those resources to provide valuable support to people in the area. It  facilitates 50 people who are aged between 19 and 70. Capital provision is a  matter for the trust, and I have created a capital priorities group that works  with it. The trust must come forward with capital projects and an ongoing  review to indicate its priorities in each trust area and criteria.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">A 40% increase in profits for vital service provision is  nothing less than extortion, and price-gouging tactics should not be used  against the United Kingdom,  which is what is happening at the moment. The large oil companies need to be  penalised, and Gordon Brown could do more by hitting those companies with a  windfall tax, which could then be used to reduce the price of fuel by 12p or  15p a litre.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am all for free enterprise, but it is wrong that  companies are affecting the health and well-being of entire nations. It would  not be the first time that Gordon Brown has introduced a windfall tax. When the  Labour Party came to power in 1997, it imposed a one-off windfall tax on  utilities, and raised &pound;5 billion to fund the New Deal programme to get the  unemployed into work.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely, 11 years later, the large oil companies, which are  boasting unbelievable profit margins, can be taxed in the same way. That could  make a difference to the constituents whom I represent, and to the constituents  of all Members. It is absurd that families with two incomes can no longer get  by comfortably, and I urge Gordon Brown to make it clear that the interests and  health of the people of the United    Kingdom are of the utmost importance. That  step is the first of many that must be taken. I support the motion.</p>

We have heard about transport costs, the effects on  fishermen, rural enterprises and the agricultural industry, and, obviously,  those suffering from fuel poverty. A number of statistics have been provided  that illustrate how rising fuel prices have a disproportionate effect on those  with lower incomes.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The increase in wholesale fuel costs are driving up the  costs of power generation and, therefore, the retail price of electricity to  consumers is also rising. Generation costs amount to over 50% of the final cost  of electricity, and around 60% of the final price of gas to consumers. Rising  energy costs are obviously of particular concern for the less well off, whether  they are pensioners, those on benefits or people on low incomes.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The interdepartmental group on fuel poverty, which has been  mentioned during the debate &mdash; chaired by my Executive colleague Margaret  Ritchie &mdash; is charged with ensuring effective co-ordination of policies and  action to address fuel poverty. My Department is represented on that group,  which has been meeting representatives from other key Departments, and which  examines ways in which Departments can make a priority of addressing poverty,  income and health. I understand that the Minister for Social Development is  expecting to report to the Executive in the autumn with an action plan to  address fuel poverty.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the House will know, my Department has no direct role in  setting energy prices, but attempts, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland  Authority for Utility Regulation and the energy industry, to create market  conditions that will exert a downward pressure on prices. It is important to  recognise that we have our own regulator, and I am sure that the House will  acknowledge that that is important. We are fortunate to have such a regulator.</p>
