Following the debate on 22 October, I reflected both on its  outcome and on Members&rsquo; concerns. Having considered the case for the abolition  of the Agricultural Wages Board (AWB), I remain of the view that the national  minimum wage structure does not offer farm workers the same level of protection  that the board affords, particularly where wage rates are concerned. Although  wage costs are slightly higher, that must be balanced against the need to  retain suitably skilled agricultural-wages workers in the North. The level of  bureaucracy that is associated with the  board&rsquo;s rate is not significant and is no different in the North than  anywhere else in these islands.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, the board is also a valuable forum where wage  negotiations take place, and, importantly, it is used as a benchmark for the  wider agrifood industry and other rural occupations. I do not believe that it  is in the interests of the agriculture industry to allow the North to become,  as has been suggested by the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union (ATGWU), the sweatshop for agricultural workers on  these islands. Abolition of the board would place agricultural workers here at  a disadvantage when compared to workers elsewhere on these islands.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the absence of an alternative mechanism to protect the rights of agricultural employees in line with the  equality agenda, I remain of the view that the board should not be  abolished. My decision is in the interests of  sustainable farming; it protects the  rights and continued availability of  farm workers, including migrant workers, in the North. Finally, I do not  propose to implement the Assembly&rsquo;s resolution to introduce legislation that  will abolish the AWB.</p>
