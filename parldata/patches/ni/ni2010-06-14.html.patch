     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of Craigavon Borough Council. Does the  Minister accept that it is unreasonable to expect local government to pay an  unquantified bill for an unquantified benefit at an unquantified risk?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That might be the case. However, even if it is, is it  reasonable to ask central government to take the hit, given that it has just  taken a &pound;128 million hit, courtesy of the Member&rsquo;s colleagues in the  Conservative Party, and given that it will have to take a further hit of &pound;1&middot;25  billion over the next three years, courtesy of his party colleagues?</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Given</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that one of the core objectives of RPA is delivering  value for money and that he put forward proposals endorsing option five, which  would have delivered &pound;438 million of savings and maximum efficiency, but the  party opposite &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; rejected that?</p>
+    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that one of the core objectives of RPA is delivering  value for money and that he put forward proposals endorsing option five, which  would have delivered &pound;438 million of savings and maximum efficiency, but the  party opposite &mdash; Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; rejected that?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I explained at the outset that the cost would be &pound;118  million, plus &pound;20 million for convergence and approximately &pound;38 million for  interest payments, and that the savings would be &pound;159 million. For the benefit  of Members around the Chamber who do not understand simple arithmetic, I will  explain: that does not stack up. It only staked up when the proposals on  convergence and collaboration, which could have delivered &pound;400 million of  savings, were introduced. However, local government rejected that, and Sinn  F&eacute;in was responsible for a lot of the spade work for that rejection.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Members are directing fire at me for not delivering  something that could save us money, but what is on the table will not save us money.  It will only save money if all the councils are engaged in the necessary  collaboration. We may proceed with amalgamation, but if we do so, I will insist  that collaboration is put in place, or we may proceed with collaboration, which  will save money up front, and proceed with amalgamation at a later point. That  is a decision for the Executive to make, and I am confident that they will make  that decision.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I see that we are now getting into the blame game. If we proceed with RPA, the  &pound;400 million of savings would be made over a 25-year time frame. Therefore, the  Minister is crystal ball gazing.</p>
