 	        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007-08, the Department made &pound;1&middot;5 million available for  discrete provision, and that has been increased to &pound;2 million in 2008-09. That  fund enables colleges to meet the cost of reduced classroom size, additional  lecture contact time, an increase in the number of classroom assistants, or the  development of other services involved in delivering tailored courses for those  with learning difficulties.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008-09, &pound;2&middot;5 million has been given to the support  fund, which enables colleges to provide help to students whose participation in  further education is prohibited by financial considerations. Since 2001, the  Department has allocated over &pound;18 million of capital funding to colleges to  improve access for people with disabilities. It is my understanding that  &pound;474,000 has been set aside in 2008-09 for capital programmes expenditure,  which includes funding to improve access for people with disabilities. I  believe that the Minister is dealing with the issue proactively.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the review of special needs provision in  further education, which the Minister announced during a debate in 2007, has  been carried out and completed by the Department. That review will include  recommendations that will be brought to the Committee for Employment and  Learning for consideration as soon as possible.</p>

 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I appreciate the fact that the review should be brought to the Committee. This  is the third time that the Assembly has debated the issue in just over a year,  and it is important that we highlight it.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the action that the Minister and his Department  have taken to promote positive attitudes towards people with disabilities and  to encourage their participation in public life. There are concerns about the  ability of young people with special needs to gain access to employment &mdash; an  area that my colleague Dr Coulter will explore in more detail later.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">Every parent recognises the desire that their children fulfil  their potential in life. That desire is no different for the parents of people  with additional needs. Furthermore, we can all recognise how disillusioning and  frustrating the inability to achieve that potential can be. Society must do  more to recognise and welcome the benefits that people with special educational  needs can bring.</p>
