     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice of a question for urgent oral  answer to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Although  the convention is that only the Member who tabled the question and the  Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of the relevant Committee will generally be  called to speak, the Speaker has agreed that a representative from each party  will be given an opportunity to ask a supplementary question on this occasion.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms S Ramsey asked the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, in light of recent deaths associated with swine flu  and the public concern about arrangements for vaccination, what discussions he  has had with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and whether he  is minded to widen the policy for vaccination to include all children under  five years of age.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I begin by  offering my sincere sympathies to the families of the two children who died of  swine flu. My thoughts are with them, and, indeed, with other families who have  suffered bereavement, at this difficult time.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, any children under five years of  age who are in at-risk groups are already offered the seasonal flu vaccine; that  has been the case for a number of years. The seasonal flu vaccination policy is  based on recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and  Immunisation (JCVI), which is an independent expert advisory committee that  advises the four UK Health Ministers on matters that relate to the provision of  vaccination and immunisation services. The process involves a vigorous,  transparent and systematic appraisal of all available evidence from a wide  range of sources.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">JCVI does not recommend that the seasonal flu vaccination  programme be extended outside at-risk groups. On 30 December 2010, at the  request of the Secretary of State for Health in England, JCVI reviewed that  position specifically with regard to healthy children who are under five years  of age. JCVI confirmed that its advice remained unchanged but that the  situation would be kept under review. On Friday 14 January 2011, I asked the  Chief Medical Officer to write to JCVI on my behalf to request that it review  that advice further. This morning, I received its response, which confirms that  its previous advice is unchanged. I will continue to be guided by JCVI advice  when setting vaccination policy.</p>
