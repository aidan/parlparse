         <p class="B3BodyText">The Children&rsquo;s Memorial  Hospital in Chicago does not provide any service that is  not available at Great Ormond    Street. The service is comparable; in fact, one of  the world&rsquo;s pioneers in the ketogenic diet &mdash; a tool for treating the condition  &mdash; is Professor Helen Cross.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">Members should be careful about running down our service. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>

-        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Service and Public Safety</strong>: It is important to remember that  we provide physiotherapy, occupational health therapy and speech therapy. Furthermore,  we have highly trained and highly skilled dietitians to monitor the ketogenic  diet and specialised medical care.

         <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal   Victoria Hospital  staff have assured us that they will do whatever they can to facilitate a  smooth transition for children returning home. I regret that children or  parents felt that they had to go to Chicago.  The services that they are receiving in Chicago  are no better than those that they would receive in Great Ormond   Street Hospital.  However, there is one major difference: on admission to the Royal Belfast  Hospital for Sick Children or Great Ormond  Street Hospital  staff will ask the patient what they can do to help him or her; staff at the  Children&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital in Chicago  ask for the patient&rsquo;s credit card. That is the difference.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot devote taxpayers&rsquo; money to private healthcare in America, unless all avenues and channels &mdash;  first, in Northern Ireland,  secondly, in the UK, and  thirdly, in Europe under the E112 referral &mdash;  are exhausted. Those protocols have to be followed.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">In at least two of the cases that we have talked about,  referrals to Great   Ormond Street   Hospital were refused. In  one case, it was refused twice. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
