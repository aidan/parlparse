     <p class="B3BodyText">Flu activity in Northern Ireland is currently at a  very low level. However, systems are in place to ensure early identification of  the new strain, should it arrive in Northern Ireland. At present, no  cases of swine flu have been confirmed in the UK,  but some travellers who recently returned from Mexico  are under assessment in Scotland.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Testing has shown that human swine influenza can be treated  with antiviral drugs, which, I am pleased to say, we have already stockpiled in  Northern Ireland.  I cannot emphasise enough, however, the simple, and potentially extremely  effective, steps that members of the public can take themselves. Good hygiene,  especially frequent hand washing, is very effective in combating this type of  infection. That is particularly important for anyone who exhibits flu symptoms.  People can also protect themselves and their families by using tissues to cover  their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Although the condition is a variant of swine influenza, I  wish to state strongly that people are at no risk from eating pork or pork  products. Properly handled pork and cooked pork, and pork products, are safe, because  the virus is not transmitted through food. There are no current travel  restrictions being placed on those who plan to visit the affected areas of Mexico or the United States.</p>

Is any advice  available about when to seek advice? Furthermore, is there a preventative  vaccination that people who are travelling to affected areas can take?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No vaccination is currently  available. It is a new strain, so it will take between three and six months to  identify it and to start to produce a vaccine. Antiviral drugs are available,  and they can be taken as soon as someone experiences the onset of the flu  symptoms.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, there are no travel restrictions at present.  Anyone who has a concern about that should consult the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office website for advice. People who are suffering from flu-like symptoms  should stay at home and contact their GP, who will further advise on what  should be done. The advice is what one would normally expect for flu. People  should stay in their house so as not to risk infecting the public, and they  should follow good-hygiene procedures such as hand washing. They should adhere  to the old adage from when we were small: &ldquo;Coughs and sneezes spread diseases.&rdquo;  Therefore, handkerchiefs and tissues should be used when coughing and sneezing.  That is simple advice.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In the United    States and elsewhere, the flu symptoms have,  so far, been mild, as had been anticipated. In Mexico, a number of fatalities has  occurred, and the World Health Organization (WHO) must understand what is causing  that. It must find out whether there is something underlying that people are  not noticing.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice under Standing Order 20 of a  private notice question to the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: The net impact of the measures that were  announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget statement to  Parliament on Wednesday 22 April 2009 is broadly neutral as regards the funding  that is available to the Executive during the next two years, with Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s share of additional efficiency savings being largely offset by  increased Budget allocations.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental budgets and the Northern Ireland Budget as a  whole are kept under constant review. Indeed, they will soon be reviewed  formally as part of the June monitoring round. That will be followed by further  opportunities to amend spending plans for the current financial year in  September, December and next February.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">My Department must always be flexible and responsive to  changing circumstances. The normal approach to managing the Budget provides a  much more flexible and dynamic process than the one-off exercise that the  Member seeks. For example, the process that I have outlined, which involves  reviewing the position four times each year instead of just once, has  identified adjustments to the Budget worth over &pound;1,000 million during the past  two years.</p>
