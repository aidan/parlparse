At this stage, to  conduct an assessment of the impact of any refusal would be premature.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Is it envisaged that gap funding will be available for voluntary groups that  are in difficulty, in order to ensure that they do not collapse before they  acquire Peace III funding?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The issue of gap funding has been raised on several  occasions. It should be clear by now that there is no gap between Peace II&rsquo;s  closing and Peace III&rsquo;s opening. Peace III first opened for project  applications in November 2007. All four Peace III themes have been open since  March 2008. It is well known that no Peace II project can expect an automatic  share of Peace III funding. Peace III was never intended to be an extension of  Peace II. It is a distinct programme with its own objectives and selection criteria.  Of course, Peace II projects can apply for a share of Peace III funding.  However, they must compete with other applications and satisfy the relevant  selection criteria.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Peace II programme concludes this year. Most of the  remaining projects are scheduled to close by 30 September. EU peace funding has  always been special, time-limited support. Peace II projects were aware of that  at the time of application. As a precondition of assistance, all projects had  to specify an end date and, if appropriate, a strategy for sustaining  themselves post-Peace II. Therefore, no Peace II project should be uncertain of  its post-Peace II future. None should expect an automatic share of mainstream  or further EU funds.</p>
