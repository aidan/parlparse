     <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised another fundamental issue, and I urge him  to have further discussions with the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I was  very grateful for the &pound;20 million capital allocation that was made in June, but  that simply deals with what is already in the pipeline. We still need financial  assistance to cover the shortfall in order to deal with the people in the  pipeline.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I instructed the Housing Executive to ensure that nobody  lost his or her place in the queue because of the lack of finance for  improvement grants. As soon as money becomes available, those grants will be  dealt with: money will flow to them. It is important that housing is put on a  sound financial footing so that those problems can be rectified.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Remember, there is not one person in the House or in the  community who is responsible for the economic downturn: it has beset us  globally. However, the one budget that has been deeply affected by the downturn  is the housing budget. That must be rectified as a matter of urgency. The  Member&rsquo;s good offices with his Minister for Finance and his ministerial  colleagues in the DUP would be greatly appreciated.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr PJ Bradley</strong>:  I was also curious about the question about South Down. Now that I have heard  Ms Ramsey&rsquo;s contribution, I am doubly confused as to why people with queries  about South Down are going to a representative in Belfast.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister advise the Assembly on how the Executive  can make good the overall shortfall in the housing budget without having to cut  expenditure on other services?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I advise the Member to read the SDLP document &lsquo;New  Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo;. In that document, the party has set out where  more money should be spent in areas such as housing, renewable energy and  upskilling, as well as stating where the money should come from. It is a unique  document and an important contribution to the economic debate. I understand  that the Ulster Unionist Party has also published a document highlighting where  money should come from.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">For my part, I have suggested measures such as the  reprofiling of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s debt, the sale and leasing back of  assets, and other measures to free up additional funding without necessitating  cuts to services. However, such initiatives require the approval of the  Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
