As Members will be aware, in October  2007, the Executive agreed the terms of reference and methodology for the  review. Since then, considerable preparatory work has been undertaken, and it  must be completed before the review can begin. We hope to move into the next  phase of the review process over the next few weeks. It is not possible to be  definite about the timetable, but the review will be progressed as quickly as  possible commensurate with doing a thorough job.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Although NICVA strongly supports a social partnership body, it  has consistently made two main points in correspondence with OFMDFM since  restoration. Those are that the original forum was flawed in its structure and  operation &mdash; particularly in its chairing and accountability arrangements &mdash; and  that a review of the forum should be completed to address those issues, rather  than reconvene the forum in its original form.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Suicide is a devastating event for all involved. It is clear that  prevention requires intervention that goes beyond the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. It needs an innovative, comprehensive,  multi-sectoral approach right across the public service. The inter-ministerial  subcommittee, which has met on three occasions, is chaired by the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety. Ministerial membership includes the  Minister of Education and the junior Ministers. The junior Ministers have  particular responsibility for children and young people, a group often affected  by suicide, and it is important that those Ministers are part of the subcommittee. Like all members of the  subcommittee, the role of the junior Ministers is to enhance  cross-departmental co-ordination.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister join with me in extending  our sympathies to the community of Bridgend in Wales?  Recent experiences there illustrate the impact that suicide can have on  a local community. Will the Minister say what role the inter-ministerial  subcommittee will have in overseeing the targets for reducing suicide that have  been incorporated in the Programme for Government?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I saw the recent news report, although I am not sure whether it  was on Channel 4 or BBC Two. It was a shocking and very sad story. Recently,  around 16 young people in Bridgend in Wales have lost their lives.</p>
