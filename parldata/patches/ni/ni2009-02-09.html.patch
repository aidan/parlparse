 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am aware of the significant reductions  in milk prices at recent United Dairy Farmers&rsquo; milk auctions; I understand that  they resulted primarily from a weakening of international markets. That is a  very worrying development, which, if sustained, could have undermined the  profitability of the dairy industry, which makes an important contribution to  the North&rsquo;s agrifood industry.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">I was teleconferencing with Hilary Benn in October when the  significant seven-pence drop occurred, and I was able to use that price drop in  my discussion with him to raise the issue of export refunds. Following that,  Executive colleagues and I worked hard to secure the reintroduction of export  refunds for dairy products, which were agreed at last month&rsquo;s EU management  committee meeting. Our continuing lobbying resulted in a major shift from the  usual position of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (DEFRA) on export refunds when its officials abstained in the vote held in Brussels.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of export refunds for dairy products is an  important step in the right direction, and our efforts to secure a successful  outcome have been welcomed by the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  and Dairy UKNI. I was encouraged to note that, following the reintroduction of  export refunds, there was a better price for milk at the January auction. I  hope that this will be the dawn of brighter days ahead for the dairy industry.</p>
-	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr PJ Bradley</strong>:  Month after month at the milk auctions when we learn the new prices and compare  them with cross-channel prices we discover that there is a differential of 10  pence per litre, which means &pound;500 per cow per lactation. Adding to that the  extra cost for feed, fertiliser and fuel, does the Minister agree that if that  downward trend continues it will lead to a continued exodus from our farms?  Does she have any intention of doing anything to support the industry in Northern Ireland?</p>

 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Perhaps the Member is asking about  direct support to dairy farmers. However, the operation of the dairy sector  falls under the common agricultural policy; therefore any support in addition  to the price-support measure such as intervention and export refunds and the  single-farm payment would have to be agreed at EU level.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, although I cannot provide further direct financial  support, we should seek to benefit fully from measures already in place; that  is why we pressed for the reintroduction of export refunds. I also welcome the  recent EU Commission announcement that it will continue with intervention  purchases beyond the fixed ceiling, if necessary, until 31 August. There are  measures in the rural development programme to help the dairy sector and to  help all farmers. The farm modernisation scheme, which opened last week,  provides measures by which farmers can apply for financial assistance.</p>

What discussions has the Minister had or does she plan to  have with the industry to assist with milk products exports; and what other  measures will the Minister pursue to return the dairy sector to profitability?</p>

The door-to-door  facility that is run by DRD at present has the ability to provide better rural  transport. However, questions remain about when it can cover most of the rural  outlaying districts.

As I have said, my officials  have been in discussion with DRD about a range of potential actions that can be  developed to deal with rural transport and access issues. Door-to-door schemes  have proved popular in west Fermanagh where, clearly, they address a social need.  My officials and their counterparts in DRD are examining ways to further extend  the scheme throughout rural areas &mdash; for example, through development of  social-care schemes.</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">The motion asks me to work with my ministerial colleague,  Michael McGimpsey, to tackle delays in the discharge of long-term patients from  learning disability hospitals, such as Muckamore Abbey. It is a pity that those  who tabled the motion did not fully appreciate the significant strategic and  co-ordinated work that is already under way to do just that. I will briefly  spell out some of the work that is being undertaken jointly between our  respective Departments to deliver health and housing solutions.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">A regional resettlement team was established in September  2007 to oversee the discharge and resettle&shy;ment of patients across all learning  disability hospitals in the North. Chaired by a senior official from the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the group takes its membership  from trusts, boards, the voluntary sector, health and social services councils,  and active discharge teams from each of the respective hospitals. My Department  is also represented on that team, as is the Housing Executive, which is a key  contributor to that work. That is proof, were it needed, that we are all  working together on this issue.</p>
