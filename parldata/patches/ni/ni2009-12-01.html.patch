     <p class="B3BodyText">The planned savings from ESA must be made, so we face a  simple but stark choice: savings can be made by cutting bureaucracy or by  cutting back on teaching and learning. I intend to cut bureaucracy. ESA is  about streamlining bureaucracy and raising educational standards. Both are  vital. I have, therefore, been considering the transitional governance and  management arrangements for the period before ESA is established. We need to  keep on the path of convergence. Therefore, I have decided to implement new  arrangements to achieve that aim.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">A smooth transition is on my agenda, as it should be for everyone  in this Assembly. I am, therefore, using existing legislation to press ahead  with interim arrangements from 1 January 2010. Those are designed to ensure  that we continue to reduce bureaucracy and streamline education services in  preparation for ESA; that momentum towards ESA is not lost and that work  towards convergence of services across the nine existing organisations is  accelerated; that greater uniformity is achieved in the services that are  provided; that school improvement and raising standards are pursued more  vigorously; that there are greater efforts to drive out savings through  efficiencies to protect front line education services; and that there is  increased financial oversight in this period of increased uncertainty.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">Simply reconstituting the boards would be contrary to the  Executive&rsquo;s objective of radical reform of education structures and would only  cause further uncertainty for staff and schools. I do not see value in simply  extending the entire board membership again for a transitional period. Many  education and library board members rightly state that they have already played  their part over the years. I have, therefore, decided to use existing legislation  to reduce the membership of the boards so that we have smaller decision-making  structures in place. For Members&rsquo; perusal, I have appended to the written  copies of the statement the numbers that will be involved in each transitional  board.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I plan to reduce membership of the boards by over half,  taking into account equality legislation and discussions with the Commissioner  for Public Appointments. I aim to ensure that the transitional boards will  reflect the communities that they serve. My Department will be in contact with  the relevant bodies that nominate to the boards about the details in the coming  days.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">It is perhaps the primary issue that is poisoning relations  between parties. To take it to another level, if the issue is not resolved in  the near future, there is the very real prospect of the institutions being  further destabilised. Indeed, we have potential threats or warnings, call them  what one will, that may have direr implications for the institutions.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">For clarity, is the Member saying that the difference  between our approaches is that although we agree that the Executive are  dysfunctional, he believes that if policing and justice is devolved that will  create stability? If, after there has been a justice Minister for some time,  the Executive continue to be dysfunctional, should that Minister resign?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: At  this stage, we are not talking about any potential personalities as Minister.  The Member is getting a little ahead of himself. The essence of the difference  is that the Ulster Unionists have identified a problem, and continue to point  out the nature of that problem, but have no plan as to how to fix that problem.  We recognise that the Executive are dysfunctional, but we believe that  addressing the issue of policing and justice, and addressing it soon, will help  to reduce the dysfunctionality.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">That will by no means remove all the problems in the  Executive, but it will make relations a little bit more harmonious and  businesslike. <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
