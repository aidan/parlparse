     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can I clarify that this is a Budget Bill,  discussing finance, not a debate on policy?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Again, I find that a curious remark, because Mr Farry&rsquo;s party leader,  discussing that very matter within my hearing before Question Time, berated  another party for its failure to discuss policies and practices. If you look at  Mr Ford&rsquo;s speech before Question Time, you will discover that he at least tried  to talk about policies and practices. So, there we have it: the party leader  berating the Ulster Unionists for a failure to discuss policies and practices,  and Mr Farry now apparently criticising his own party leader for having  discussed policies and practices as part of the Budget debate.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The Budget Bill has to be seen in the context of the Hillsborough arrangements.  We would not have a Budget Bill or the devolution of justice if it had not been  for the Hillsborough arrangements that were agreed in February. Part of those  arrangements, which were welcomed by the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance Party,  talked about what an addendum to the Programme for Government would look like.  We have been urged to look at that. Yet, when we begin to look at it, it is  curious that so many in the Chamber remain silent, and that others, within even  their own parties, seem confused.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
