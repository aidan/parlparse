 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  The Ambulance Service has not met its targets, and not only in Mr Buchanan&rsquo;s  constituency. Those targets are being reviewed again. Measures have been put in  place in the south-west in order to upgrade the service. For example, an  additional 24/7 accident and emergency ambulance has been operational since  August 2006, for which 11 additional staff were recruited and trained. A new accident and emergency ambulance has been in operation  since January 2007 to replace the spare vehicle. An intermediate-care crew has  been place since July 2006. Two paramedic rapid response units are operational from 8.00 am to 8.00 pm. Clinical support  officers have been in place since March 2006, and a new ambulance  deployment point at Fintona fire station has been available from March 2007.  Two intermediate-care vehicles were commissioned for the Omagh area and have  been in operation since early February 2007. All of that, in itself, will not  do the job, but it shows that the Ambulance Service has responded to the points  made by Mr Buchanan and others about ambulance provision. That was one of the  points that I made when I announced the new,  enhanced local hospital in Omagh. Ambulance provision was one of the  other investments to go with that hospital.</p>
