     <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Rivers and Lakes: Restocking</p>
     <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure how much his Department  has spent on restocking the lakes and rivers under its control in each of the  last three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1329/10<a name="AQO1329/10" id="AQO1329/10"></a>)</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: In the last three years, the Department has  spent the following amounts on restocking the public angling estate: &pound;218,603  in 2007-08, &pound;194,381 in 2008-09 and &pound;294,103 in 2009-2010.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr PJ Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Has he had any recent meetings with the  Northern Ireland Environment Agency about the restocking of polluted rivers? I  ask him to do everything that he can to lobby the Minister of the Environment  and the Minister of Justice to ensure that repeat polluters are severely dealt  with by the law.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I agree that pollution of rivers is a particular  problem. I have not had any meetings recently with the Environment Agency about  restocking and supporting fishing activity in the rivers, but I am aware of the  ongoing problems in a number of rivers. For example, after a recent fish kill,  DCAL restocked the Ballymartin tributary river to the Sixmilewater with 1,000  trout. We are conscious of the impact of pollution on a number of the rivers.  The Member&rsquo;s question may be better directed at the Minister responsible for  the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Minister touched on the question that I want to ask, which is about the  pollution in the Sixmilewater over the past couple of years. Will he outline  any other programmes that have been undertaken in the Sixmilewater? What other  stocking measures have taken place there in the past three years?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Using Peace I and Peace II EU funding, DCAL has  funded the Antrim and District Angling Association, Ballynure Angling Club and  Doagh angling club for rehabilitation work, which includes a fish pass at  Barbour&rsquo;s weir. As I said, we restocked the stretch from the Ballymartin  tributary river to the Sixmilewater with 1,000 trout. DCAL is also working with  Ballynure Angling Club and Antrim Angling Association under the salmonid  enhancement programme to remove brood stocks to Bushmills Salmon Station for  restocking purposes.</p>
