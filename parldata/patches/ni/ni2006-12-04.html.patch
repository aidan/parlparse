Money had already been allocated to them, fairly and impartially, by the  Northern Ireland Events Company. They had received their share, but they were  not satisfied. Sinn F&eacute;in cannot cope with equality; it prefers preferential  treatment. It prefers to see others discriminated against and discrimination in  favour of republicanism; its members do not like equality and fairness. The  Secretary of State overruled the democratic decision of the Northern Ireland  Events Company and the fair and equitable allocation of money to republican  groups by giving them more money at the behest of Messrs Adams and Kelly.</p>

Those who do not like  the Secretary of State&rsquo;s interference in the Chamber should think about how  everyone on this side of the House feels when the secret hand of the IRA Army  Council extends into the Chamber and directs the activities, actions and  statements of certain Members. Sinn F&eacute;in can cry all it wants about the  Secretary of State being about. People must wake up to the fact that he is here  because Sinn F&eacute;in has failed all the people of Northern Ireland by ensuring that democracy cannot run its course, and by  standing in the way of democracy for decades.</p>

It is right that we  should have the opportunity to debate the interference of the Secretary of  State, but, as a previous Member mentioned, there is a range of more pressing  issues to be addressed. It was therefore disappointing that my party&rsquo;s  amendment did not get chosen, because it would have provided an opportunity to  debate issues such as water charges, the rating system, academic selection and  the review of public administration. I am  glad to say, however, that we will  have a debate on the review of public administration.</p>

I have also heard rumours  that the hon Member for South Down Mr Nesbitt will not be standing for election  in the Assembly again. I do not know whether those rumours are true. If they  are, I urge him to reconsider, because this House obviously wants to hear more  of the exciting analysis that he often gives us.

My first thought was that he was having a laugh. It may be very noble of the hon Member  to criticise the Secretary of State for his interference, but he has  developed selective amnesia about his role, and his party&rsquo;s role, in the work  of the previous Assembly and about the interference of previous Secretaries of  State.</p>

Indeed, it was so  clear a resignation that I understand that he had to make his own way home that  day &mdash; his ministerial car had been withdrawn. Use of his fax machine was  withdrawn as well, and he no longer had access to his office. A few months  later, however, there was interference from the then Secretary of State, and a  resignation that had been as plain as the nose on anyone&rsquo;s face suddenly became  an &ldquo;unresignation&rdquo;.

On that occasion, the Ulster Unionist Party seemed to care little  about the integrity of the Assembly. Indeed, the party&rsquo;s then leader was  perfectly happy to benefit from the Assembly&rsquo;s lack of integrity.</p>

Unfortunately for the  Ulster Unionist Party, that was simply putting off the inevitable. The  Secretary of State and the Govern-ment have now passed the stage at which it  was pointless to try to rescue the Ulster Unionist Party. A &ldquo;rescue Reggie&rdquo;  plan is no longer on the agenda.</p>

 	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The most historic aspect of this afternoon&rsquo;s part of the  debate was the silent and seamless handover of the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair by Madam  Speaker to the Deputy Speaker, Mr Molloy. To the best of my knowledge &mdash; and I  stand to be corrected &mdash; that was the first time that a Sinn F&eacute;in Member has  presided over a debate in the Chamber. That was an interesting moment, and Mr  Molloy took the Chair without any objection from the DUP or anyone else in the  Chamber. Today, out of small beginnings, limited progress has been made.</p>
 	  	<p class="B3BodyText">The UUP wanted to have today&rsquo;s debate in order to highlight  the deficient manner in which the Assembly is  forced to do business. A range of political matters has been mentioned  today: 1798 was probably the earliest date mentioned, although another Member  attempted to go back as far as Henry II. Irrespective of those, however, it is  important to recognise that the Assembly lacks the credibility that comes with  being in charge of its own affairs. It appears to be very much subject to the whim of the Secretary of State, Peter Hain.  Members will do well to remember that Peter Hain dined out on speeches  that threatened ill against Assembly Members and their staff. He said that they  would all be thrown out of work and become unemployed. He worried my wife and  alarmed my children.</p>

Those who support a  united Ireland have no prospect of success.
