My officials have been exploring  that area of opportunity.

Those discussions were especially relevant to the forests within the signature  project areas that the Tourist Board has identified.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Forest Service officials have been involved in discussions  with the Tourist Board and other stake&shy;holders about the contribution that  forests can make and how that can best be delivered. We are forming  partnerships with other interested providers, such as councils, to better  realise the opportunities available.

     <p class="B3BodyText">A further programme was put together to support farmers who  wished to take the next step and become more active in building a new supply  chain. Under the Fit for Market initiative, we piloted the supply-chain  development programme with six groups of farmers. That demonstrated the  benefits of the programme, and it has now been adopted into axis 1 of the rural  development programme to be available to more farmers. In turn, that interfaces  with the processing and marketing grant scheme, and the marketing and  development grant scheme, to support market-led initiatives through financial  support, capital costs and non-capital expenditure.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is also working with farmers and processors  to increase their capability to improve and strengthen their supply chains. We  are supporting a three-year project with the University of Ulster  to analyse the vast amount of market data that is available from the Tesco  Clubcard database. My answer is quite long, so I will take a supplementary  question.</p>

The figures that have been published in the Irish  Republic show that there has been a 10% reduction in funding for the  North/South Language Body, which amounts to &euro;1&middot;84 million, and a 4% reduction  in funding for Waterways Ireland, which amounts to &euro;1&middot;64 million, when compared  against the 2008 out-turn figures.</p>

However, budgets have not been agreed and, from my  perspective, the priorities will be to deliver efficiencies from North/South  bodies and to further reduce the funding disparity between Irish and Ulster  Scots. Additionally, if current funding ratios are to be maintained, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  financial contribution to North/South bodies may need to be adjusted  accordingly.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">In the first instance, responsibility for increasing safety  at sports grounds and ensuring that it is not compromised rests with the owners  and operators of those venues. However, the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure is currently taking forward a safety at sports grounds initiative. The  aim of that is to encourage and assist owners and operators of major sports  facilities to improve spectator safety at their grounds. As part of that  initiative, the Department has introduced and is currently implementing new  legislation on safety at sports grounds; that is, The Safety of Sports Grounds  (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, Sport Northern Ireland, which is responsible  for the development of sport, including the distribution of funding, has been  running funding programmes designed to assist owners and operators of venues to  improve spectator safety at their venues. Those include a stadia safety  programme and, previously, an interim safe sports ground scheme.</p>

Many of us have concerns about that issue, but does the Minister know  whether there have been any major incidents or injuries at football grounds in  the past few years?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, which is  pertinent in the context of some headlines that followed previous questions for  oral answer. Unfortunately, discussions about spectator safety can cover  anything from a faulty turnstile or light bulb to major problems with stands in  which a significant number of people may be at risk. Some people in the media  concentrate only on the major issues, for understandable reasons. I am not  aware of any safety considerations at football grounds that have led to major  accidents in recent years. However, that is not a cause for over-optimism in  future. There are grounds in need of upgrading that have received money and  will continue to receive money. We must ensure that maximum spectator safety is  delivered and that participants play at grounds that have safety provisions  built in.</p>

Does he agree with me that, considering  the very high levels of illiteracy and innumeracy in Northern Ireland and particularly  the 250,000 people between the ages of 16 and 64 who have been failed by the  education system, there must be the closest co-operation between the library  service and the Department of Education?
