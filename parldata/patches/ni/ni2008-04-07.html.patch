 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr  Donaldson)</strong>: I thank the Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood for tabling the  question. As a constituency MLA, I had a meeting last week with the National  Federation of SubPostmasters in Northern    Ireland to hear directly about its concerns  on the recent announcement by the Post Office, which reflects the position of  the UK Government and is not a devolved matter.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Post Office has issued those proposals for  consultation, and the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister will consider, with other interested Departments, what representations  or action would be appropriate on what is now a matter of implementation rather  than of policy development. In the  meantime, we urge all Members to consider carefully the proposals with  the communities that they represent and to make their views known to the Post  Office.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also raised issues concerning access, social  disadvantage and vulnerable groups in Northern Ireland. The Department of  Trade and Industry, which initiated this review of the post office network, was  advised of the requirements of section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 when  it was developing its change strategy. At that stage, individual closures were  not specified.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The UK Government have accepted that there is a need to  support the network beyond 2011, and they claim that the new access criteria  provide a framework to ensure that vulnerable consumers in deprived urban,  rural and remote areas are protected. Post Office Ltd stated that steps are  being taken to modernise the network, and it is examining innovative ways to  deliver cost-effective services. However, the points that the Member made on  access and vulnerable groups can be considered and responded to in the  consultation process.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the model used by Essex County  Council, where services have been developed through a local provider. That is a  model that can be considered, but I stress that those are not issues for the  devolved Administration; they are issues for the Westminster Department and  Post Office Ltd. However, suggestions concerning Northern Ireland can be made in the  context of any responses that Departments make to the consultation.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister&rsquo;s cross-cutting responsibilities for older people, and for  tackling poverty and social exclusion, will the junior Minister advise the  House whether he has received any information from the Post Office or the  Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that gives him confidence that the  interests of elderly and vulnerable people have been adequately taken into  account?</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that many older people entrust the Post Office with  their savings and are reluctant to place them with any other institution, does  the junior Minister agree that it is important that the Post Office assures the  public that it continues to be committed to providing safe, accessible, local  opportunities for older people to save and manage their finances?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I thank the Committee Chairperson for his comments and questions. In the  Member&rsquo;s constituency of Newry and Armagh,  there are eight urban branches and 38 rural branches. It is proposed that two  will close, and eight will be replaced by outreach services. In Mr Attwood&rsquo;s  constituency of West Belfast, two branches are  proposed for closure. The closure of the Blacks Road branch is perhaps the most  controversial, and the Member has spoken about that publicly.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that it is a generalisation, but over 99% of  people who live in the UK  will still live within one mile of a post office. However, that does not offer  much comfort to people in rural communities who are losing their local sub-post  office. In response to the request from the Member for West Belfast Mr Attwood  for the Executive to consider the issue, we will take on board what the Member  has said.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Any discussions that take place between the Department and  the other Departments will consider the impact on elderly people with regard to  safety and accessibility. Our response to the Post Office will ensure that  those issues are highlighted and that the concerns that both Members have  raised are brought to its attention. As I said earlier, I encourage all Members  to take up the invitation to respond to the consultation. It is important that  communities have a voice in the process; Members are well placed to ensure that  that voice is exercised.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Over the weekend,  services at the accident and emergency department at the Mid-Ulster Hospital  were reduced. The department closed at 5.00 pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday  due to a lack of appropriate medical cover. I understand the views of Members  and the local community that that is an unacceptable position. The Northern  Health and Social Care Trust has apologised and has advised me that it was an  exceptional circumstance and one that left the trust with no alternative but to  reduce the opening hours of the accident and emergency department. Later today,  I will meet the trust&rsquo;s chief executive, and I will seek her assurance that  such an unacceptable situation will not arise again.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the decision that was taken at the  weekend was an operational decision, and an equality impact assessment was not  appropriate in those circumstances. The trust&rsquo;s measures were to address an  immediate issue of patient safety, and they do not signal a change in the  normal opening hours of the accident and emergency department at the Mid-Ulster Hospital. To address staff shortages,  the trust has recently completed a recruitment exercise for staff-grade doctors  in accident and emergency. It expects one additional doctor to commence work in  April, with a further two commencing work in August.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The situation is disgraceful. The  Minister said that it was an &ldquo;exceptional circumstance&rdquo; and that he intends to  meet the Northern Trust to seek assurances that it will not happen again. This  morning, I spoke to the Northern Trust, and it cannot guarantee that it will  not happen again. It cannot guarantee that it will have doctors this evening,  tomorrow evening or for the rest of the week. That is totally unacceptable, and  I ask the Minister for assurances about what he can do, and to outline to the  House what work he will undertake to ensure that this does not happen again.</p>
