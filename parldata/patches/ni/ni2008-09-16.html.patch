           <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: To qualify my statement, there had been  a meeting of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission in May in order  to clear up a small amount of business before the summer recess. That is why  there were a limited number of items on the agenda.</p>
           <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s question relates to tourism and protection of  stocks. I said that 25 projects had been approved. I presume that he is talking  about the hardship payments to the commercial salmon fishermen on the Foyle,  which were discussed at the Council meeting. The Loughs Agency made the first  payment, totalling &euro;2&middot;5 million, to affected fishermen in December 2007. The  second stage of payments, totalling &euro;600,000, was paid in April 2008. The final  stage of payment is expected in spring 2009.</p>
           <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. Will she provide more detail on biodiversity week and outline the  potential for the aquaculture sector in Carlingford and Foyle? Go raibh maith  agat.</p>

           <p class="B3BodyText">The aim of biodiversity day was to celebrate Ireland&rsquo;s  biodiversity and to promote awareness of the need to protect our natural  environment. As part of the Irish celebrations, six biodiversity hubs were  selected, including the Foyle catchment area. A total of 37 events were  scheduled in the Foyle area over the week, which attracted more than 1,500  visitors. The schools programme was fully booked &mdash; 32 schools sessions took  place &mdash; and the week was a resounding success.</p>
           <p class="B3BodyText">On the question of aquaculture development, during the NSMC  meeting in May the Loughs Agency presented its plans for aquaculture in the  Foyle and Carlingford areas. I believe that there is significant potential to  develop the sector, which is already valuable in the Foyle and Carlingford  areas. The transfer of aquaculture licensing powers to the Foyle, Carlingford  and Irish Lights Commission will allow aquaculture operations in Lough Foyle to  be licensed through the Loughs Agency for the first time, which is an important  step in ensuring a transparently good standard of practice in relation to  husbandry, hygiene, fish welfare, disease control and environmental impact.</p>
           <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her short statement. I note that 25 applications have  been recommended for tourism, angling and marine tourism. Has there been any  discussion with, or approval from, the Planning Service on those applications  that require such permission? Has that been dealt with? A difficult situation  is developing around tourism and planning developments.</p>
