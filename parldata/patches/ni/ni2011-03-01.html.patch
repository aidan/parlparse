     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Given the great reduction in the capital  budget, can the Minister detail how local councils will be affected?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Previously, &pound;200 million was set aside for the capital  waste infrastructure fund. We have looked at and addressed the issue and have  had discussions with waste management groups, and it was established that it  would be better if that funding were made available on a recurrent basis,  because most of them are involved in PPPs. The requirement for recurrent  funding will not kick in during this financial year, and it will probably not  kick in in the next financial year either. In the third financial year of the  Budget period and thereafter, we will, potentially, be in a position in which  recurrent funding will be required. In that sense, the &pound;200 million was not the  right model for delivering the waste infrastructure programme, and we are  currently in negotiations with DFP to seek a way forward on recurrent funding.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister will be aware that,  in its Budget response, PWC suggested that the Department would no longer be in  a position to fund site purchases or to finance projects and that that would  create potential cost implications for local government. Further to the answer  that the Minister has just given to the House, can he outline any discussions  that he has had with local government about ways to mitigate any such potential  impacts of the current draft Budget?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We have been engaged with the three waste management  groups in particular, because that is what the large capital budget had been  set aside for. As I indicated, it was identified that the best way forward was  through recurrent funding for the PPPs. There may be a requirement for a small  figure, in government terms, of some millions of pounds to acquire a site for  one of the waste management projects, but we certainly do not need a &pound;200  million capital budget to deliver the waste infrastructure programme.</p>
