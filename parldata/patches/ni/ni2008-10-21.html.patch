 	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have previously stated, my Department faces many  competing priorities. However, I am pleased to announce that I have managed to  secure extra funding for fertility services that will make a real difference to  reducing waiting times over the next six months. I will invest &pound;800,000, which,  commissioners advise me, will allow up to 200 extra women to be treated before  the end of the financial year. I expect the waiting time to be reduced to a  maximum of 12 months shortly afterwards.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the longer term, I aspire to meet guidance from the  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which recommends  that three cycles of treatment should be offered to those who seek fertility  treatment. However, just as in the rest of the UK, the lack of funding makes that  extremely difficult to achieve. As a first step, I want to ensure that we make  the best use of any additional recurrent funding that I am able to secure.  Therefore, as part of the consultation, I will ask whether couples want access  to a second treatment opportunity or whether they would prefer to further  reduce waiting times in the first instance. The question of which of those  options best meets the priorities of service users will form an important part  of the consultation.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional funding is good news for fertility services  and couples who desperately want to have a child. The aim of the review has  been to ensure fair and equitable access to that service and to ensure that we  make the best possible use of the resources at our disposal. I am therefore  pleased to announce the launch of a public consultation on publicly funded  fertility treatment in Northern    Ireland. I look forward to hearing the views  of the public and of Assembly Members, which will help inform the way forward.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, I have made the case for women who are  approaching the upper end of the age limit to be given priority so that they do  not end up being discharged from the system before they are able to receive treatment.  That is an issue that still needs to be addressed. When we debated this issue  in the Assembly in October 2007, the Minister indicated that approximately 590  patients were waiting for IVF treatment, and that approximately 420 cycles were  provided each year. Will the Minister provide an update on those numbers, the  current waiting times, and whether there have been any improvements since the  debate in October 2007? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The current waiting list  comprises just over 600 people, and the current treatment cycles are running at  just over 440 a year. With the investment providing an extra 200 treatments, it  is anticipated that that will allow the waiting list to come down to around 400  people, which almost matches the current number of available treatments. That  means that no one will wait longer than one year for treatment, which is a  positive step.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of age weighting has arisen time and again.  Stakeholders studied that issue and strongly feel that age weighting should not  occur because it is not equitable. If women at the upper end of the age scale  were age-weighted, women lower down would suffer because there are only so many  cycles available. Age-weighting one group of women would effectively deny  others treatment. Therefore, the way to deal with that is by attacking the  waiting lists, which I will do using extra investment.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>:  Representatives from five of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s counties have talked about Lough  Neagh during this debate, so I will add my voice from Fermanagh. I welcome the  opportunity to discuss the tourism potential of Lough Neagh. As has been  mentioned, it is the biggest freshwater lough in the British   Isles. It has a number of unique characteristics, and, depending  on one&rsquo;s perspective &mdash; although it is not the perspective of the Members who  are present in the House &mdash; it is either perceived as a barrier in the heart of  Northern Ireland or as something that bonds together five of the six counties  of the Province and six of our local authorities.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I prefer to think of it in the latter way, and there are  strong opportunities to maximise the benefits that tourism can bring &mdash;  including the wigeon. I used to have a dog named Wigeon, but I do not think  that that was the wigeon to which Mr Shannon referred.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board&rsquo;s &lsquo;Strategic Framework  for Action&rsquo; took the lead in identifying where the tourism sector needed to  prioritise efforts. I am aware that some people believe that there is too much  focus on those projects, at the expense of other equally deserving parts of Northern Ireland.  However, it is important that the five signature projects, which are central to  that strategic framework, be completed as planned. The Executive have provided  the money for those projects and, ultimately, they will benefit all the people  of Northern Ireland.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I say that in the full knowledge that Members who are  present would have liked Lough Neagh to have been the basis for a signature  project. I certainly would have liked the Fermanagh Lakelands to have been the  basis for a signature project, but we are where we are. I readily agree that  the signature projects are not the only show in town &mdash; I am very clear about  that, and Mr Molloy made that comment at the start of this debate.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need a good-quality tourism product to sell in the local  and international marketplaces. The Tourist Board&rsquo;s draft corporate plan  identified product portfolios, including culture and heritage, about which we  heard from Members opposite, sports tourism, waterways, and business tourism,  which is becoming a big part of what the Tourist Board is trying to achieve.  All those portfolios can be of considerable benefit to the Lough Neagh area.</p>
