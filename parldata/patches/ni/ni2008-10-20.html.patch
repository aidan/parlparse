 		    <p class="B3BodyText">One imagines that the reverse would be the case. GPs feel  frustrated, because they can explain in clinical and sometimes detailed terms  what a person is going through; however, there is little room to describe how  someone&rsquo;s mobility is affected, which is a key factor in making a decision on  mobility and care.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, one aspect that disturbed me was the  role of some of the medical examiners and practitioners who visit people in  their homes. Ian Paisley Jnr is 100% right in what he said. People,  particularly older people, open the door, offer tea and make a fuss of their  visitors. That is like old people years ago who cleaned the house because the  home help was coming. It is their cultural background, and they do not realise  that being able to go and put on the kettle may limit them from receiving a  benefit to which they are entitled.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">More than that &mdash; and, possibly, worse &mdash; people with chronic  depression, whose mobility is severely disrupted, and who, genuinely, should be  in receipt of the benefit, were told to give themselves a shake. If a medical  examiner does not have the wherewithal, compassion or empathy to understand a  condition that may qualify for award, that is disturbing. Given the high level  of mental-health illnesses, for all sorts of reasons, I urge that the report  and recommendations be accepted, and ask Members for their support.

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when all politicians are being criticised in the  context of the DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in stalemate and logjam in the Executive, it is worth  letting the public know &mdash; and particularly worth reminding the media &mdash; that a  lot of good work goes on in this place. I know, too, how much work the DSD  Committee put into the Charities Bill, and other legislation that I brought  forward to the Committee. The popular jibe about all those politicians up there  on the hill doing nothing, is, therefore, inaccurate and unfair. I gently  suggest to the media that they could do more to challenge such a perception,  rather than feed it.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members, and the Committee, will  appreciate that I have had insufficient time in which to do justice to the  report&rsquo;s recommendations by giving them the careful consideration that they  merit. I do not intend, therefore, to respond in detail to all the specifics in  the report, but I will give it the consideration that it deserves and respond  to the Committee in due course.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, I want to say a few words on the issues that  are raised in the report. Members understand my view on welfare entitlement: I  am determined that every person who is entitled to support under the welfare  system should receive all the support to which they are entitled. That is,  perhaps, particularly so in the case of disability living allowance, where  decisions on entitlement impact on vulnerable people. That is why I welcome the  opportunity to debate the way forward on the administration of disability  living allowance.</p>

 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The announcement was welcomed by many in the farming  industry, but, as yet, it has not been confirmed in Brussels,  or by the Ministers with the relevant responsibility in Britain and Northern Ireland. Such confirmation  would assist farmers with the costs that have been imposed on them, and it  would come at a critical time when essential savings must be made in the  farmers&rsquo; budgets.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, in issues relating to animal health, disease  control and the cost to the industry, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development and her Department have been found asleep at the wheel. The  Committee has had to take the forefront in pressing the Department on many  issues, but, at times, it has been with little success, unfortunately. One such  example relates to the incidence of TB and brucellosis. Following the  Committee&rsquo;s forcing of the Department to confirm that there is correlation  between badgers and the incidence of TB across the Province, we expected that  the Department and the Minister would take urgent action for the sake of animal  health. However, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has failed  to take action for the good of animal health, despite the fact that she was  granted the authority, by the Minister of the Environment, to cull 1,000  badgers. That is the issue that we are dealing with under the 30-months scheme.</p>

 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am grateful that the European Commission  has moved on the over-30-months scheme. Farmers in the North of Ireland will be  relieved that fewer cattle will have to go through BSE testing and that they  will not have to bear the resultant costs. Despite what the Chairperson of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development says, the Minister has been  responsible. Furthermore, she has acted quickly to protect the health of the  farming community and the stock here through the decisions that she has made on  various issues that have come before her in the past number of months. I  recommend that the Committee act similarly; it should act responsibly and  follow the process that is relevant to the over-30-months scheme. The process  must involve the Food Standards Agency, which has a relevant responsibility,  and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, which is  responsible for that agency.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The process must be gone through, and I understand that  they are looking at the process favourably. The European Commission has also  indicated that it is moving on the matter, and it is important that we consult  and relate our findings to the Commission.</p>
