I do so determined that, just as the new state of Northern Ireland was born from the flames of  those controversies, a new Northern    Ireland, for this day and for future days,  will be born from the fires of our past.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">The island   of Ireland is in economic  turmoil. We face rising unemployment. We do not yet know the outcome of the  discussions between the Dublin Government, the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) and the EU. Those discussions will have serious repercussions for the  economy in this part of the island. I note that some unionist colleagues are  nodding their heads in agreement. I welcome that, because anyone, regardless of  their political point of view, who believes that what happened in Dublin over the weekend  is to the benefit of this society is sadly mistaken.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: It is  hoped that the &euro;90 billion, which is &pound;77 billion, of financial assistance from  the United Kingdom, the IMF  and the European Union, which was announced today, will place the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s finances on a sounder footing.  However, there will be further difficult choices ahead. On 7 December, details  of the fiscal consolidation for 2011 will be announced in the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s  Budget, which is expected to have a significant impact on economic growth.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The Republic   of Ireland&rsquo;s economy has  already faced one of the deepest recessions in the euro zone, with output  falling by 10&middot;9% between 2007 and 2009. That has implications for the Northern  Ireland economy, as the Republic of Ireland accounts for more than 10% of sales  by local manufacturing companies and 28&middot;5 % of exports. That highlights the  importance of Northern Ireland  firms diversifying their export base and seeking out new markets, which is one  of the reasons why I will shortly lead a trade mission to China.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to have discussions with the Irish Government on  the matter only if the measures to reduce the Republic  of Ireland&rsquo;s Budget deficit have  direct implications for the Northern    Ireland economy.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">I hear Ms Anderson and others talking about finding  additional funds and resources, but where do they think that those funds will  come from? Do I go into the social care budget to take money from learning  disability funding? Do I go into the children&rsquo;s fund to take money out of child  protection funding? Is that what I am supposed to do, or should I take money  out of the funding for acute hospitals, cardiac surgery or paediatric services?  Those are the sorts of questions facing us. We do not have the money.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">We push for efficiencies and, indeed, have made huge  advances in efficiencies over the past three and a half years. I am the only  Minister to have delivered on the review of public administration. No Sinn F&eacute;in  or DUP Minister has achieved it, but I have achieved it. I have completely  reorganised the Health Service to save &pound;53 million a year and reduce  administrative jobs by 1,700. All the time, the same numbers of staff do more  and more work. That is what is called efficiency and doing better. However,  those staff need and deserve support. Inaccuracies do not support them  whatsoever.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">It is a very important subject, because the Health Service  is doing so well for the population. Our life expectancy is rising, and thank  God that more people are living longer. However, those people need help. They  need support to allow them to have extra years and quality extra years. That is  where domiciliary care comes in, and it is just part of how we address the  issue. I have put in extra money and will continue to do so, but demand  outstrips the supply of resource.</p>
-    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>As I have said to  the House before</strong>: this is just the beginning. People need to be prepared to  put their hands up to protect services, not just in health. Sammy Wilson has  said that he will protect health. His figures do not quite add up &mdash; he is  several million pounds short &mdash; but he is getting there. He is starting to get  it. When I listened to some of what Ms Anderson said today and Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane  said last week, I hoped that maybe Sinn F&eacute;in is starting to get it, too. Social  care is so important to health. We have to look after the elderly population.  We do not have a choice. If we do not look after elderly people in hospital, we  have to look after them in their homes. It is one or the other. If we are not  prepared to look after them at home, we will end up looking after them in  hospital, with all that that entails.</p>
