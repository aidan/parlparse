 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee wishes to give adequate time to scrutinise this important Bill. It has received 21  submis&shy;sions from 16 interested parties, and it has just  begun to take oral evidence from those individuals and organ&shy;isations.  Members will appreciate that that takes time.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will,  therefore, need a time extension in order to consider their views, and  the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s responses, before completing a  clause-by-clause scrutiny and compiling its report on the Bill. The Committee  faces a heavy workload in the coming weeks, which includes consideration of the  Budget, Planning Policy Statement 14 (PPS  14), environ&shy;mental governance, the review of public administration and  statutory rules</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">I, therefore, seek an extension of the deadline to 7 December 2007 to allow sufficient time for the  Comm&shy;ittee to consider the Bill and report on its findings, and I ask  Members for their support. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: I wish I could welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments, but I cannot.  When will she stop using our schools as some kind of ideological football and  get down to the real business of trying to create a fair and robust transfer  test? It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say that she will take  her time and not be rushed. When is the navel-gazing and introspection going to end, and when are we going to give some  form of assurance to the teachers, pupils, and parents with children in  year five, who do not know what is going to happen next? It is an abdication of  responsibility. Our grammar schools were supposed to have been saved at St Andrews.</p>
 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  People can be confident that I will bring forward arrangements that will be in  the best interests of all our children, and I will take the time necessary to  do so. That is my job, and I assure everyone here that I will do that.</p>

 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Grants for uniforms are available to families where a parent is in receipt of  income support, income-based jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or receives the child tax  credit and is ineligible for the working tax credit because they work for less  than 16 hours per week and have an annual taxable income of &pound;14,494, or less.  The grant available is not intended to cover the full cost of the uniform but  is designed to assist those in need with the cost of purchase. The wearing of  school uniforms is not a statutory requirement, but a matter for the discretion  of individual schools.</p>
 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, aLeasCheann Comhairle. What legislation covers school  uniform policy, and what are the Department of Education&rsquo;s guidelines?</p>
 	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  The wearing of the school uniform is not governed by legislation, but falls to  schools to determine. The day-to-day management of schools, including any rules  regarding the dress of pupils, is a matter for school principals, subject to  any directions that might be given by boards of governors. Following the issue  of the General Consumer Council&rsquo;s report on school uniform in 1992, the  Department wrote to all boards of governors in 1993 suggesting that they might  wish to consider: the importance of ensuring through school prospectuses, etc,  that parents are aware of the requirements of a school&rsquo;s policy on uniform; the  cost implications for parents, particularly those on low incomes, of a school&rsquo;s  policy on uniform, and the implications, in  terms of value for money and consumer choice of supplier, of uniforms  often being available from a limited number of official suppliers.</p>
