       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The additional funding that will be made available  is &pound;388 million over the four years. Of that, &pound;269 million is on current spending,  and &pound;118 million is on capital spending. Of course, there is also the &pound;820  million that was made available in the draft Budget, hence the figure that the  Member referred to in his question.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I, too, encourage the Minister for Regional  Development to see the A2 scheme through. I trust that, in recognition of the  generosity that I have shown him, he will use the additional money that has  been made available to proceed with that scheme.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In his statement the Minister mentioned the integrity of healthcare provision  in Northern Ireland.  How does he square that with the letter from the permanent secretary, which he  also mentioned in reply to a question, that stated that, come 1 April 2011, it  would be almost impossible to balance the budget for the Department of Health?  Does he take that letter seriously?</p>
-      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance of Personnel</strong>: When I get a letter from the permanent secretary that  indicates that the Health Service is about to go into bankruptcy, I ask myself  whether that state of bankruptcy descended suddenly upon the Health Service.  Usually, when businesses start to go down the tubes, there has been a long  process of occurrences and impacts and action that should have been taken that  perhaps was not. I ask myself why, when trends were identified during the past  four years, action was not taken, such as making savings or, as I said in my  statement, bringing a comprehensive case to the Executive for spending on  health. That has not been done. I also read in the letter from the permanent  secretary that the Minister refused to take actions that could have remedied  the situation. I ask myself whether that is a result of past incompetence,  present indolence or whether it is a future attempt to use the Health Service  as a cheap ploy in the election. If that is the case, it is a damning  indictment of the person who is in charge of the Department. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Productivity in Northern Ireland runs at 80% of the UK average, and  many business commentators felt that the draft Budget did not address that  adequately. What real changes has the Minister made in the Budget in response,  or does he dismiss those commentators, who include, of course, the Minister for  Enterprise, Trade  and Investment&rsquo;s economic advisory group? Does he dismiss them, as he did in  the Budget Bill debate, as &ldquo;sectional&rdquo; and &ldquo;partisan&rdquo;?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: In a moment, I will give the Member the figures so  that he can see that the Department has taken that seriously. I could accept  his criticism had he prefaced his remarks by saying that if I had taken money  from A, B and C, I could have given it to the areas that he has been promoting.  Let us look at what we have done. Perhaps the Member has not listened to or  read my statement; perhaps he simply ignored it. The Department for Employment  and Learning has gained &pound;51 million, most of which will go into further  education and training. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
