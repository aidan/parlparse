     <p class="B3BodyText">I can also tell the Member that in the South Down area, the  Department is working as a partner in the recently formed employment task force  for the Mournes area, which has been set up as a direct response to the  economic downturn. The group aims to deliver a practical working document that  will map out the short-term and long-term solutions for addressing issues  around the current economic recession.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The task force was established in March of this year and  includes all relevant stakeholders from the public, private and voluntary  sectors, such as Kilkeel Chamber of Commerce, DARD, the Planning Service,  Southern Regional College, Invest NI, the South Down Fishing Task Force, local  councillors and a number of representatives from the business sector.  Participation in that forum could be a key factor in finding a way forward in  the coming days.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: We have been trying, as in all areas. The Member  must understand that the Department provides services for every part of Northern Ireland.  Although the profile of the problems differs from area to area, there are  parallels between, for example, the Magherafelt area and the Member&rsquo;s  constituency. Construction was one of the key drivers in both those areas, and  that has been dramatically hit.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, on a recent visit to a jobcentre in the Member&rsquo;s  constituency, I discovered that not a single construction job was available  there. Nevertheless, many people have been encouraged to participate in courses  to obtain a skill and to attend college to get a qualification.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">We are struggling, particularly in construction, but funds  are available through my Department&rsquo;s main adult return-to-work provision,  Steps to Work, which was rolled out across Northern Ireland in September 2008.  Its design is sufficiently flexible to meet current and emerging needs, as  demonstrated, for example, in recent adjustments to accommodate apprentices who  have been made redundant from key sectors such as the construction industry.  Additional adjustments to that programme include enhanced provision for short  training courses of up to 10 days to try to give people a skill; increased  expenditure up to &pound;2,000 for training per individual, which was previously set  at &pound;300; and short training courses to assist participants to equip themselves  for available job vacancies. We are trying to do all that, but there is no  disguising the fact that the number of well-paid jobs on the jobcentres&rsquo; books  is dramatically reduced, and the Member must be aware of that.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: To  return to the question, redundancy is a very serious situation for anyone. Will  the Minister explain what types of retraining are provided through the Steps to  Work scheme?</p>
     <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Steps to Work is the Department&rsquo;s main programme  for retraining and offers an array of training opportunities. Advisers are  aware that when they meet a client they must first assess his or her needs.  That could include helping a client with essential skills, because we find that  if people do not have essential skills it is very difficult for them to  advance.</p>
-    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">Advisers then have to look at what the client has  been doing hitherto. For instance, if people have been working in the  construction sector there is not much point in training them for that sector at  the moment; we have to offer training in an area in which a client is more  likely to get a job in the short term, which could be in retailing or some  other area. The adviser then has to look at whether the client has a skill that  could be developed further.</p>
-    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">This is a much more flexible system, and we can  take new qualifications in new sectors into account. For example, in light of  recent revelations I said that if moat cleaning were required we would consider  an apprenticeship in that, because there may be some local demand for the skill.  That might be an area for us to explore.</p>

     <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what  opportunities have been identified to increase the percentage of community heating  systems using indigenous, renewable fuel sources.&nbsp; <a name=AQO2811/09>(AQO 2811/09)</a></p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster): I will be issuing a revised strategic energy  framework for consultation shortly, and it will set out the Department&rsquo;s view  on the future energy priorities for Northern Ireland. Among other  things, the consultation will ask for views on how my Department should  progress work on renewable heat. I expect that developing proposals on  renewable heat will include work on community-scale solutions for generating  heat cleanly, efficiently and cost effectively.</p>
-    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">I also plan to issue a cross-departmental action  plan on bioenergy soon. Following a review of the potential to exploit  bioenergy in Northern    Ireland, the priority for development should  be on bioenergy for heating and electricity. The cross-departmental action plan  will outline objectives that will support the development of bioenergy in Northern Ireland  and capitalise on the area&rsquo;s natural resources, contribute to the region&rsquo;s  security of energy supply, support jobs and businesses and help to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: I thank the Minister for her answer. Will  she say how and when such a scheme will be implemented? Will she also comment  on grid connection charges, which are detrimental to many who want to put  electricity back into the grid? I know that connection to the grid cost one  company &pound;700,000 and that such charges are stopping a lot of this work taking  place. As I understand it, there are no grants available from the Department to  assist with grid connection.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment: I thank the Member for her supplementary question. As I  said, we have already completed the scoping work on the strategic energy  framework. I chair an interdepartmental working group on the general issue of  sustainable energy, which is working very well together. It met on Thursday  past.</p>
-    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">The work on renewable heat is very much part of  the strategic energy framework. We need to reduce the amount of fossil fuel  that we use in this country, and an examination of district and community  heating will form part of the response. As the Member knows, some very good  entrepreneurs are examining the subject of district heating. The Carbon Trust  has done some work on industrial sites, and work is being done in west Tyrone  to look at providing heat for housing developments. Therefore, quite a lot is  going on.</p>
-    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">I am very clear that heat, in addition to other  issues such as electricity, has to be included in the strategic energy  framework. I hope that that framework will be published for consultation over  the summer months so that the Member will see what we plan to do.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Community heating systems have been  successful in Scandinavia, particularly in Denmark where more than half of all  homes are heated through such schemes. What discussion has the Minister had  with the Minister for Social Development about developing such an  infrastructure here? What support has the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment given to companies here that want to develop community heating  systems?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Community heating systems are very much part of the Department  for Social Development&rsquo;s plans. As the Member will appreciate, however, that is  a long-term strategy and will require substantial financial resources. As I  understand it, such systems will become a viable option for DSD only when it is  building new homes.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I referred to a developer in west Tyrone who is  looking to build 20 homes, and part of that development will include a  community heating system. A lot is going on in that respect. The Member might  be aware that a community-style heating system is being developed for the eco-village  that the Department for Social Development is planning for the former Grosvenor  Barracks site in Enniskillen. I have not had any meetings with the Minister for  Social Development about that matter, but a dialogue is ongoing and will continue,  through my interdepartmental working group.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">When I took the education portfolio, I inherited a system  that was geared towards the needs of 40% of children. I have issued guidance on  admission to post-primary schools in 2010, guidance that provides the basis of  an education system tailored to the needs of all our children, not just 40%.  The guidance is an opportunity to move away from a system that is based on  privilege and status and rejection and failure; it lays the foundations of a  system based on social justice, equality and academic excellence; it is a  system that gives all our children a fair chance.</p>
-    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Consider the  outcomes of the old transfer arrangements</strong>: one in four children in  non-grammar schools is entitled to free school meals; the ratio in grammar  schools is one in 17. Therefore, if we are agreed that we need to do more to redress  that imbalance, surely a free school meal entitlement admissions criterion is  the fairest means of achieving that objective.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">It would be funny if it were not so sad watching the  Members opposite trying to justify their defence of privilege. How did the  11-plus serve us in this year&rsquo;s admission criteria? How did the policies  espoused by the Members opposite support the 10 children from the Shankill Road, the  16 children from the New Lodge or the 25 children from Sandy Row that went to a  grammar school? There is no justification for some of the proposals of the  Members opposite or their defence of privilege.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In Derry, the four grammar  schools educate 43% of post-primary pupils in the county; the other nine non-grammar  schools educate the remaining 57%, and 13% of children are entitled to free  school meals. From the three primary schools largely serving the Sandy Row  area, 11 out of 79 pupils transferred to a grammar school. From the three  primary schools largely serving the Shankill area, 10 transferred to a grammar  school; and from the seven primary schools serving the Falls Road 49 out of 284  children transferred to a grammar school. We need to get real if we intend to  bring about change.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">It is not a tenable position for a Minister who is  committed to equality, social justice and educational achievement to continue  with this deeply flawed system. Getting rid of the 11-plus and bringing in a  fairer system is the best thing that we can do for working-class children  across the North, boys or girls, Protestant or Catholic, or from newcomer  communities.</p>
