     <p class="B3BodyText">Members will agree that it is vital that the scoring  mechanism reflects all the relevant equality issues and still enables strong  and sustainable projects to benefit from the programme funds. It is only by ensuring  that that we will reap the benefits of a good, strong and sustainable rural  community. The review of the projects scoring mark framework has continued  unabated in the areas that have opened for calls. Project staff are carrying  out eligibility checks and site visits on the applications, in preparation for  their assessment by the local action groups.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  am glad that the Minister answered both the question and my supplementary.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the fact that the Minister has reached the stage where the  information is being passed to the local action groups. Does she accept that it  has taken too long to get that information agreed and passed to the groups;  that rural areas for which axis 3 is designed have suffered because a decision  was not made until today; and that there will be no more delays?</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment</strong>: I can assure the Member that a new  delivery model for axis 3 affords councils a greater and more central role in  delivering rural development measures. Their involvement in delivering that  will provide good training in preparation for the greater responsibility of  councils for rural development delivery under the new RPA. However, the spend  is now getting on the ground, letters are going out, and I can assure the  Member that there will be no further delays.</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What assistance is available under  axis 3 for renewable energy projects?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: A number of areas are helping us to  support renewable energy. In addition, my Department is reviewing its renewable  energy strategy, the outcome of which will inform the axis 3 position on  stand-alone energy projects. In the interim, the Department is working to  promote the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency through our renewable  energy action plan. Key actions include support for profitable energy production;  supply chain development; forestry products and by-products; use of agriwaste  for energy; deployment of renewable energy technologies in the wider economy;  and energy efficiency. CAFRE is also delivering technology transfer programmes  on renewable energy. I have a very long supplementary, and I am conscious of  time, so I am giving you just the bare bones.</p>
