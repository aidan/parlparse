 <p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of when the A&amp;E department disappeared  from Limavady, but accident and emergency services have been rationalised to  the benefit of the population. As Members know, it is not simply a matter of  what is contained in the accident and emergency department, but the services  that exist behind it. A proper A&amp;E department requires paediatrics, acute  surgery and an intensive care unit. An A&amp;E department without supporting  services behind it would be catastrophic.</p>

 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am content that there is  equality of access for all groups of Health Service dental patients across Northern Ireland.  I have approved the recruitment of 38 additional Health Service dentists in  areas where access was problematic. The initiative has been successful and has  greatly improved access to Health Service dentistry. Furthermore, the community  dental service provides care and treatment for patients who have special needs  and are unable to access dental services in the high street. My officials are  negotiating a new contract with the British Dental Association Northern Ireland  that will further improve access to services. That contract will be piloted  next year.</p>
 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Will the Minister assure the House that  the new commissioning arrangements for 2010-11 will not have any adverse impact  on dental services? As a former healthcare worker, I know that dentists and  dental hygienists used to be able to enter residential homes and statutory  day-care centres to provide services to people in care. It was a good idea to  have a dental clinic in an outreach centre. Has the Minister any thoughts on  the provision of that service, which, I understand, is no longer available?</p>
