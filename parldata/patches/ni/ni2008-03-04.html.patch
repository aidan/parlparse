 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: If we are to have an in-depth examination of the problem by the  RQIA, surely it is better to let that organisation carry out its inquiry and then, if need be, have a full and  independent public inquiry.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Would it not benefit  the full public inquiry to be able to draw on the RQIA&rsquo;s decisions? Were  the inquiry to do that, we could proceed step by step, as we should do.  Moreover, as far as immediacy is concerned, has not the Minister said that the  RQIA&rsquo;s work will be finished in 12 weeks? How much quicker is that than to have  a public inquiry that could last 12 months?</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment represents the way forward. Therefore, I take  pleasure in commending the amendment to the House.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend my colleagues on the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety for bringing the motion  to the House. I thank those Members who contributed to the debate, and I thank  the Minister for responding. However, I am disappointed that certain Members,  and certain parties, felt the need to move the debate&rsquo;s focus to point scoring  and personal attacks. That is not good enough.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members spoke with passion and emotion.  Hospital-acquired infections is certainly a massive public-confidence issue,  and we must work at restoring the public&rsquo;s confidence in the Health Service.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is fitting that the call for a public inquiry into the  outbreak of clostridium difficile should have the full weight of the Health  Committee behind it. We thought that that was the case; however, it was Members  who supported the motion in Committee who tabled the amendment to it.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing the motion, the Chairperson of the Health  Committee set out the latest figures on cases of clostridium difficile, and the  number of deaths linked to the infection over the first six weeks of 2008. I  remind Members of those stark figures: 194 cases of clostridium difficile and 24 deaths in which clostridium difficile  was either the cause of death or a contributory factor.</p>
