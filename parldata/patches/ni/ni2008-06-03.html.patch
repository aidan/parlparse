That means that no case of infection is  regarded as acceptable, and the response to each new case is immediate and  urgent.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">Healthcare-associated infections cause pain and distress to  patients, and the outbreak has led to a loss of public confidence in our health  and social care service.

         <p class="B3BodyText">We have a limited time to resolve this issue, and I  question whether this is the right proposal and the right location. I am not  convinced that Rose Energy&rsquo;s proposal is the only option that is available to  enable Northern Ireland  to meet our targets and to comply with the requirements laid down by the  European Union. At the moment, I am in discussion with a Northern Ireland-based  company that uses a more environmentally friendly process, will recycle the  chicken waste, and will create a fertiliser by-product that the agriculture  industry can use. That is therefore a much more efficient and effective process  that will have the same advantages as Rose Energy claims for its process. The  company that I refer to is in discussion with DARD, DETI and DOE about this  matter. I seek to advance that option, because I believe that it is a better  alternative.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the needs of the poultry industry and poultry  farmers, as well as our targets and obligations, but I am not convinced that  Rose Energy&rsquo;s process is the best technology for achieving those objectives.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">I am far from convinced that this is the right location.  For years, I have been aware of the concerns of local residents about the  impact that the existing plant, which is on the Ballyvannon Road, has on the quality of  their daily lives. The road network in that area has been badly damaged by the  heavy vehicles that travel daily to and from that plant. The lives of local  residents have been made miserable, and I mean miserable. Residents have come  to me in tears as a result of this matter, and others have had to sell up and  move out of the area because of the impact that the existing plant has had on  the quality of their lives. If we factor into that the additional, heavy  traffic that will be generated by the transportation of chicken waste to the  new plant, I cannot understand how the quality of life for residents will be  improved. Indeed, it will have the opposite effect.</p>
-        <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The environmental  impact must also be considered. Mr Ford is correct</strong>: this is an  environmentally sensitive area that is close to Lough Neagh. Not just the  visual impact is in question; the impact on the environment as a whole must  also be considered. The issue is location sensitive. If one were searching for  somewhere in Northern    Ireland to locate a plant of this sort, one  certainly would not put it beside Lough Neagh, which is one of our greatest  natural resources. That must be taken into account.</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">The impact on tourism is also a factor, but the  environmental impact is the major factor that the Department should consider  when a planning application is made. The impact on the roads will also have to  be considered. These are narrow country roads &mdash; it is a rural area, and the  roads were not built to take the heavy traffic that is to be anticipated. At  the very least, Rose Energy needs to look for an alternative site if it is serious  about the proposal. This environmentally sensitive area is the wrong site for  the plant, which will have a detrimental impact on the lives of local  residents.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to poultry farmers who have lobbied me on  this issue. When the impact that the plant will have on the local community is  explained to them, they have shown themselves not insensitive to it. They are  prepared to consider alternative locations, and they are also open to  considering other processes.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">If a planning application is made, the Planning Service  will have to consider it in due course. However, in those circumstances, the  Department will be within its rights to exercise its authority to hold a public  local inquiry on the matter. The issues are of such a nature and of such  importance that, at the very least, a public inquiry will become necessary if the  plan goes ahead.</p>
