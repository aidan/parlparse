       <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Question For Urgent &nbsp;Oral Answer</p>
       <p class="H4StageHeading">Belfast  Health and Social Care Trust</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice of a question for urgent oral  answer to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
-      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion"><strong>Mr </strong>McCarthy asked the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety for his assessment of the leaked proposal  that the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust is to axe a total of 150 beds in  the Royal Victoria and Belfast   City Hospitals.</p>
+      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong> asked the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety for his assessment of the leaked proposal  that the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust is to axe a total of 150 beds in  the Royal Victoria and Belfast   City Hospitals.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: For months, I  have been saying that times are hard in the Health Service, with challenging  efficiency savings of some &pound;700 million and increasing demands. However, in  April 2009, the Assembly refused to exempt the Health Service from efficiency  savings. As I said at the time of the Budget settlement, it was as good as it  gets, but it was not enough. The situation has been further exacerbated by the  cost of the swine flu pandemic.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I am still in the position of having to fight for the money  that I need to protect the people of Northern Ireland, and I trust that  the Executive recognise that in their response to the September monitoring  round. My Department has now received proposals from the trusts, including the  Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, to achieve break-even, and those  proposals are currently being considered. No decisions have been made.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for coming to the Chamber to answer the question.  Devolution to the Assembly was meant to bring benefits to everyone in Northern Ireland.  The diabolical news of the loss of some 150 hospital beds is a shattering blow  to the many patients who are already waiting for a hospital bed. Indeed, Health  Service redundancies are completely outrageous.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">Alongside that additional work, other work streams have  been taken forward: the community safety partnerships have funded a street  intervention programme to tackle antisocial behaviour; the local council funded  two community festivals targeting both sections of the community in the Heights  area; and the gap project, which is a collaborative programme operated by local  churches, is a 26-week pilot scheme that offers a drop-in facility and  engagement with the local communities. Through neighbourhood renewal, the  sports and community centre in the Heights is being extended and refurbished in  an ambitious capital programme.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">However, we cannot afford to be complacent, nor will we be.  Genuine issues remain to be addressed. Sectarian attacks on property and people  have been carried out in the locality, reports have been received of widespread  intimidation across communities, and loyalists have issued death threats to the  McDaid family and witnesses to the attacks. Therefore, much remains to be done  at all levels.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that the initiatives that I outlined are short  term and reactive in nature. Neither OFMDFM nor those of us sitting in the  Assembly can end sectarianism in Coleraine or elsewhere. Only the people can do  that. However, we can support local people along the path of ending  sectarianism. Moreover, we can lead by example through demonstrating respect  for each other, sharing our history and developing a common agenda. That will  happen when we recognise that we enter the Chamber from different backgrounds  and with different experiences and aspirations. However, we enter as equals  with equal rights and entitlements, and we a share the common agenda of  delivering a better society.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyText">I am passionate about tackling sectarianism wherever it  arises. As several Members said, the problem is not restricted to Coleraine.  The biggest contribution that each of us can make is to challenge sectarianism  and to promote equality and understanding in our constituencies, because that  is where we can exercise maximum influence. I need go no further than my North Belfast constituency to find an example of an area  that has witnessed the worst effects of sectarianism. It is important to state,  however, that North Belfast has taken the best  and biggest steps to tackle the generational scourge of sectarianism.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM will continue to work with community and civic  leaders in Coleraine to support and resource their work. I hope that the legacy  of all our endeavours will be no more deaths or injuries as a result of  sectarianism. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
