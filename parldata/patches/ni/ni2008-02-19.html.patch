 	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are plans to develop a new health and care centre that will provide integrated primary care  services for the community of Larne, as well as plans for a new fire and  rescue station in the town. The community also needs access to locally provided  palliative care and rehabilitation services, and I know that the board and the  trust are examining proposals to ensure that that happens.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that those who need acute services can  continue to access an acute hospital within a reasonable time. Indeed, Members  can take comfort from the fact that travel  time from Larne to Whiteabbey Hospital and Antrim  Area Hospital  is under 30 minutes; from Larne to the Mater Hospital  it is 32 minutes; and from Larne to the Royal group of hospitals it is 34  minutes.

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Minister appreciate that the most northern part of the East Antrim constituency &mdash; Carnlough &mdash; is approximately  one hour from an acute hospital. We are not  just talking about the town of Larne,  but the entire hinterland. Indeed, there are other areas in the Glens where  travel times are even longer.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I am aware that Mr Beggs&rsquo;s constituency extends beyond Larne. The rule is that  patients should be able to reach an acute hospital from wherever they live  within the golden hour. That is why hospitals are sited where they are, and  that is a rule that we endeavour to ensure is always followed. We developed the  first responder service to allow more inaccessible communities to get help  immediately, before an ambulance arrives. As I understand it, that also applies  in Island Magee.</p>
