 	        <p class="B3BodyText">We also wish the subcommittee to help to achieve the  greater integration of children and young people&rsquo;s policy, funding and service  delivery, and that will be done without compromising or blurring the roles and  responsibilities of individual Ministers.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The re-establishment of  the ministerial subcommittee is only  one of a large number of public service agreement targets associated  with children and young people that we have set. Those targets are ambitious;  however, we are ready and willing to rise to a high standard and to work  tirelessly to ensure their full and swift delivery.</p>
 	        <p class="B3BodyText">The subcommittee will  strive to achieve transparency through the timely sharing of information  that is relevant to children and young people, and which will help to  facilitate joined-up working. The first meeting of the ministerial subcommittee  on children and young people is being arranged with other Ministers.</p>

All of this is about partnership. We want to involve the scrutiny Committee, as  we have already done, and we welcome its input. We also intend to ensure that  all stakeholders are a part of this exercise. The whole Assembly is on board,  because this is our future. The scrutiny Committee will be kept up to date on  all issues that arise.</p>

Furthermore, will the junior Minister give the Assembly a working definition of  severe child poverty and explain how he plans to eradicate it?</p>
