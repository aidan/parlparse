 		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is an enormous defect in the Programme for Government  and the legislative package.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Executive have put great emphasis on tackling  sectarianism. Why are the First Minister and deputy First Minister not putting  similar emphasis on that? Why are they not bringing forward legislation to deal  with that evil in our midst? I look forward to a situation in which that can be  remedied and to this time next year, when we will have a richer, deeper and  much more imaginative programme of legislation.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have set  themselves up as the official Opposition or the unofficial Opposition,  and then there are those who are not sure  whether they are in opposition or in Government but who will make the  decision someday. Despite those problems, the Assembly has moved forward.  Despite the great difficulties that have existed  and will continue to exist, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have proven that they  are prepared to move forward.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, in that context, we have the roll out of  legislation. We also have the draft Budget and the draft Programme for  Government, which are out for consult&shy;ation by Members and the wider community,  and from which will flow other legislation as necessary. As has been repeated  in the House today, legislation for its own sake would be a mistake. However,  the greatest boost that we have given to  society so far is an Executive that are up and running and working  together.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is worth reading. However, I am still unclear as  to whether the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP support the amendment.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the SDLP  and the UUP have three Ministers in the Executive. I look for the  legislative format that those three Ministers are bringing forward. If they wish, they could bring forward a raft of  measures prior to the Budget and the  Programme for Government, but I see none. There is the opposition within  and the opposition without, to which they refer.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott talked about &ldquo;tolerance and inclusion.&rdquo; Every  time I hear the Ulster Unionist Party talking about tolerance and inclusion, I  almost have to pinch myself to make sure that it is serious. That party ran the  state alone for 50 years, and it did not do so on the basis of tolerance and inclusion. Its reaction to the Irish  language &mdash; both inside and outside the Chamber &mdash; is neither tolerant nor  inclusive.</p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The question that a lot of people in Northern Ireland will be asking today is  why they bothered with devolution. Devolution was supposed to be about local people taking control of their own  futures and innovating on policy. However, the legislative programme  that has been put forward by the Executive today offers anything but that.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was great hope in our society for change; however, at  some stage, that hope has to be turned into delivery. The manifestos of the  various parties prior to the Assembly election were all worthy documents, and  were full of great proposals regarding the issues that they would address once  they were in power. We have seen little of that today.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislative programme outlines a mere 18 Bills. Those Bills are about parity, and about bringing  Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom. Frankly,  we could have simply tagged on to those Bills through  legislative consent motions. The Bills are about internal housekeeping  and bringing matters into line because of human rights implications.  Furthermore, there is carry-over legislation from direct rule &mdash; measures that  direct rulers were going to take in any case. The ball had already started  rolling on a raft of proposals that are only  now coming to fruition. Where is the  new thinking? Where are the fingerprints of the four parties in the  Executive on this legislative programme? They are not there.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Issues that have been discussed include legislation on a  shared future and a single equality Bill, which is something very close to the  heart of Sinn F&eacute;in. Neither of those is anywhere to be seen. Other issues  discussed were the Football (Offences) Act 1991; mental-health issues and  implementing the Bamford Review; free personal care for the elderly; a marine  Bill; and the establishment of an environmental  protection agency. Those are only seven issues; the list goes on and on.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party colleague Naomi Long has campaigned actively  throughout the direct rule years on this issue, with a view to strengthening legislation  on dangerous dogs. We are glad of the  opportunity to bring the matter to the attention of the House.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current legislation stems from the Dangerous Dogs Act  1991, which applies to the whole of the UK. Its introduction was  accompanied by significant tabloid attention, following a series of dog attacks  that attracted a great deal of publicity at the time. The Act was supplemented  by the Dogs (Amendment) Act (Northern    Ireland) 2001, which gave power to courts  and magistrates to order the destruction of dogs.</p>
