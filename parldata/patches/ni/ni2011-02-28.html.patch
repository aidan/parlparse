     <p class="B3BodyText">Patsy McGlone had concerns about the statement made by  Friends of the Earth, which was released in conjunction with the British Retail  Consortium and NIIRTA. It is worth bearing in mind that the British Retail  Consortium is against a levy of any type on plastic bags or any bags, and it is  important that the matter is viewed in that context. I spoke to a  representative of the British Retail Consortium this morning, and even though  he is against a levy, he welcomes the fact that it is being amended so that the  Assembly can look at the scope of extending it to other types of bag. So, he is  very much in favour of that as opposed to a levy on plastic bags only.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised at some of the comments from Friends of the  Earth. Declan Allison made a statement in conjunction with two other groups  this morning, I believe. Mr Allison is on record as saying that linking the  green new deal to the levy sends out a very strange message that using plastic  bags is a good thing. That is a bit of a contradiction when compared to Friends  of the Earth&rsquo;s position in its response to a consultation on a Scottish  proposal for a bag levy. In that case, it argued that the funding should be  ring-fenced for environmental projects. I do not know whether Mr Allison is out  of line in regard to Friends of the Earth policy, but mixed messages certainly  seem to be coming from Friends of the Earth in that respect.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson supported the Bill, and I welcome that. He  said that it is also important that the green new deal is set up as soon as  possible. I fully agree with that. If the Bill does not go ahead as planned,  that will jeopardise the funding streams necessary to fund the green new deal  and environmental projects, which is what the Bill is partially about. However,  primarily, the Bill is about effecting environmental change and reducing the  amount of plastic bags in circulation. We should move forward in the same way  that the South did. The proceeds should go towards environmental measures as  opposed to into the central pot.</p>
