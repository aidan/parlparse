 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Programme for Government has just been  introduced to Members, and questions are about to be taken on it. However, a  significant number of pages appear to be missing from the documents that have  been circulated. The documents are exceptionally thin, and those sections to  which the First Minister and the deputy First Minister referred in respect of a  shared future and good relations appear to be absent &mdash; certainly from the copy  that I have. Is there a chance that those pages have been left at the printers,  and will it be possible to have them circulated later?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I understand the point that Mrs Long is making. However, that is certainly not  an appropriate point of order.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I call the Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, I inform Members that more than 40 Members wish to ask  questions. That is understandable, considering the business of the House this  morning. I remind Members that if their questions are short, that will enable  their colleagues to also ask questions.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr <strong>Kennedy)</strong>: That is timely advice, Mr Speaker. As Chairperson of the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, I  welcome the publication, for consultation, of the draft Programme for  Government 2008-11, and the draft investment strategy. I also welcome the clear  indication of the First Minister, confirming the status of the document &mdash; that  it is a draft Programme of Government, for consultation, which may be subject  to change.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the importance of the proposals, I have some concern  that, taking into account the Christmas holidays, the consultation period will  effectively last for a shorter period than normal. It is a pity that the  proposals could not have been published earlier to ensure that there is a full  12-week consultation period.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I inform the First Minister and the deputy First Minister  that, yesterday, my Committee &mdash; in the historic location of Magee College,  Londonderry &mdash; received an informative and  thought-provoking presentation from representatives of Save the Children on the  level of child poverty. That presentation was part of the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry  into that matter.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government  that it will be a priority of the Executive to tackle the levels of poverty in Northern Ireland  in general, and, in particular, the intention to halve child poverty by 2010,  and end it by 2020. What are the specific actions that have been included in  the draft Programme for Government to achieve those aims?</p>
