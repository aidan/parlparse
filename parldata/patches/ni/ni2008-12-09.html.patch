             <p class="H4StageHeading">The Way Forward on Tuberculosis (TB)</p>
             <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement on the way forward on tuberculosis (TB).</p>
-            <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on my decision on the  way forward on TB in the North.</p>
+            <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on my decision on the  way forward on TB in the North.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">A new strategic approach on how we deal with TB, agreed  jointly by industry and Government, has been identified with key stakeholders.  The aim is, through a partnership between industry and Government, to move  towards the eradication of TB in the most cost-effective way and in a realistic  time frame. The timing and implementation of the strategy as we progress  depends on how and when it is resourced.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">First, I shall set the scene by outlining the current TB  disease situation in the North. We have made considerable progress with TB in  recent years. Since levels for the disease peaked in 2002, the herd incidence  has been reduced by almost 50%. That is in sharp contrast to the experience in Britain, where  the incidence of TB has been increasing. In the North, overall, the trend in  disease levels has been downwards over the past five years or so.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">However, bovine TB is a very complex disease, and it  continues to be one of the most challenging and costly animal-health problems  that we face. The total cost to Government of controlling the disease in the  2007-08 financial year was more than &pound;21 million, plus costs to the sector. It  is worth mentioning that those costs include a great deal of emotional cost to  the farmer if his herd is restricted or contracts TB. A human element is also  involved, because TB can be passed to people. I know of people who caught TB as  a result of contact with animals. Therefore, when I refer to costs, I am  talking not only about the financial costs but about the human cost of that  awful disease.</p>

             <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the statement that the Minister has made, I  am glad that the Department and the Minister have finally seen some sense and  listened to the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development and, more  importantly, to farm businesses throughout Northern Ireland, and are now  working towards eradication of the disease.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated that she believes that brucellosis can  be eradicated in Northern    Ireland in the next five years. Will she  tell the House why she is continuing with a &pound;6 million study into the  prevalence of TB in badgers, when her Department has for years been conducting  analysis of badgers that have been killed on the roads to do the very same  thing? Will she also expand on how she hopes to eradicate brucellosis from Northern Ireland  herds within the next five years, and explain how it took so long, and at so  much expense, for her and her Department to come up with the obvious solution?</p>
             <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before the Minister answers those questions, I say to the House that the  convention has always been that the Chairperson of a Committee is given some  latitude when asking particular questions to ministerial statements. That is no  different this morning, and perhaps the Minister will wish to address the  question at the beginning of Dr McCrea&rsquo;s contribution, although it does not  relate to the statement this morning.</p>

I discussed the situation this morning with officials and advisers and given  the circumstances, I felt that it was appropriate to break tradition in this  case and give the House a further update this morning. However, after I make  this statement, I will not take further questions on the issue, because the  matter of TB is very important, and that is what we are here to discuss today.</p>

             <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday evening, my officials completed their tracing  visits to all the premises notified to the Department by the Department of  Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the South as having received potentially  contaminated feed. Those results were passed to the Food Standards Agency  (FSA), which, as Members will know, concluded that no pigs born and reared in  the North had received any contaminated feed. The FSA also advised that there  is no risk from pork or pork products containing only pork from the North.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">My officials also found that eight herds of cattle had been  fed product from the affected Southern supplier. Samples were taken of that  product, and are being tested as I speak &mdash; I anticipate the results later this  week. At this time, those herds are restricted, and all animals that received  that feed have been highlighted in our animal and public health information  system (APHIS) so that they cannot enter the food chain without testing clear  for any contaminant. Furthermore, traces of animals from the herds that have  gone to slaughter have been provided to the meat plants concerned, so that they  can identify any products that remain from those animals.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">At present, we have no results from animals or feed. When  those are available, they will be provided to the FSA for risk assessment of  any threat to public health. My Department is taking precautionary and prudent  measures to protect the industry and public health while we await the results  of those tests and the subsequent risk analysis. My Department continues to  work closely with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety,  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Food Standards  Agency, and we expect further information from the Department of Agriculture,  Fisheries and Food when results of its further tests become available. We will  also be liaising with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in  preparation for an EU meeting in Brussels.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>

             <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The remark that I made was that  one can always learn lessons with the benefit of hindsight. One of my concerns  was the communications between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland &mdash; that  was the specific issue about which I was talking &mdash; and how the information was  disseminated through the Departments here. I will examine that issue because I  have concerns about it. I will conduct a review of how those matters came to my  attention because, as I said, I was not made aware of the situation until  Sunday afternoon.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked specifically about beef products, and my  point is that, at this moment in time, the Food Standards Agency is saying that  there is no evidence to suggest that consumers should stop eating beef, and  that milk is safe to drink.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">Tests are ongoing, and samples will continue to be taken &mdash;  those tests take three days to complete. The Food Standards Agency is  independent of my Department, and, indeed, independent of all Northern Ireland  Departments, and at the moment, after examining the evidence, the FSA has  advised me that it is safe to eat meat and drink milk, and I want the House to  receive that message today.</p>

I thank the Minister for his  comprehensive answer. The message that we want to send out from here today is  that it is safe to eat beef and that it is safe to consume dairy products. Does  the Minister agree that a degree of caution must be exercised &mdash; be that by  Members, the media or spokespersons of interested organisations &mdash; because  although people&rsquo;s best intentions may be to protect the consumer, unguarded or  unconfirmed comments will only serve to damage one of our most important  sectors.</p>

             <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: At this point, I am trying to  deal with the situation and the facts as they are and as I find them. In the Irish Republic,  a series of tests has been conducted, the results of which showed that several  premises were clear, several had animals with dioxin levels just above the safe  limit, and others had animals with dioxin levels well above the safe limit.  Consequently, the Irish   Republic has ordered a  trade withdrawal. I can confirm that, at this point, the Food Standards Agency  is not asking for, or ordering, a trade withdrawal. That is an important piece  of information.</p>
             <p class="B3BodyText">We are in a changing situation. However, I emphasise that  there is a very low risk to public health from contaminated animals entering  the food chain; and the risk of harm to individuals that I am talking about  requires long-term exposure to dioxins. Nevertheless, if test results show that  we have animals with dioxin levels above the safe limit, I will not hesitate to  take the appropriate steps. At this point in time, my advice is that it is safe  to eat beef, that consumers should not stop eating beef, and that milk is safe  to drink.</p>
             <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that the spectacular overreaction yesterday &mdash; when  pork was taken off the shelves even though no pigs had consumed contaminated  material &mdash; has not engendered consumer confidence but has caused a crisis in  consumer confidence, which is spreading to the meat and milk industries? The  sooner that Mr McGimpsey and the FSA take actions that engender consumer  confidence, the better for all of us.</p>
