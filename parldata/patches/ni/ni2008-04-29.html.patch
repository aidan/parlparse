 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Member explain why Members of his party do not attend Health Committee  meetings and why, when they do, they leave early?</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does my friend want me to answer that point?</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will take an intervention from my colleague.</p>
-		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mc McCallister</strong>:  Mr Easton&rsquo;s question is more relevant to me, since I am a member of the Health  Committee. The last time that Mr Easton raised that same question, he missed  the next Health Committee meeting. It is strange that he has become the  self-appointed attendance officer for the Health Committee. Sometimes, Members  are prevented from attending Committee meetings because they have other matters  to attend to. My attendance record is not much different from the majority of  other members of the Committee. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must make his remarks through the Chair. I remind  Members that we are having a debate on the dental service, not on the goings-on  of the Health Committee.</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  That is excellent advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. The attendance officer for the  Health Committee should understand that. Does my honourable friend find it  strange that Mr Buchanan snipes about underinvestment in the Health Service,  and yet supports the draft Budget?</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I could not agree more. I cannot understand why Mr Buchanan talks about  underinvestment when it was indeed his Minister who denied our Minister the  resources that he needs to deliver the world-class service that our people  want.</p>
