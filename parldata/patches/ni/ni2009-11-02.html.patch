       <p class="B3BodyText">Although we have, in the main, encouraged courses with an  economic element, a significant proportion of resources is still available for  recreational and similar courses. The college is the responsible authority for  promoting itself locally. No government Department is best placed to  micromanage such a situation. Local people must have a major say in how that is  done, because they know the territory and the local demands.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">The South   Eastern Regional   College was quick off the  mark in responding to the economic downturn, which is a subject that we will be  returning to in a moment in another question. There has been a substantial  capital build, and we are encouraging as many people as possible to use those  facilities for such purposes. With the widespread support that we have, I am  confident that we shall succeed.</p>

       <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>The Question  was as follows</strong>:</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">To ask the Minister for Employment and Learning whether he  can provide an assurance that technical colleges will prioritise and support  the training of potential employees in high-tech engineering, such as polymer  and biochemical engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  291/10<a name="AQO29110"></a>)</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Employment and Learning: I am happy to  give the Member such an assurance. My Department sets the broad strategic  framework for the further education sector in Northern Ireland and channels its  funding accordingly. For example, one of the Department&rsquo;s public service  agreement targets is to increase the proportion of college provision that is in  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  priority skills areas, one of which is manufacturing engineering.</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  The C&rsquo;Mon Over campaign is designed to attract students to return after they  have finished their education elsewhere. Has the Minister found any evidence to  suggest that the students most reluctant to come home are those who have been  through integrated education or those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual?</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I do not have an answer to that question. The  statistics that I rely on are compiled nationally, and I do not believe that  they are broken down in that fashion. Also, I have no anecdotal evidence one  way or the other, and, unless the Member can provide me with some information,  I am not able to answer her question.</p>

Newcastle and the first phase of Downpatrick were opened  earlier this year, and Bangor,  Newtownards, Ballynahinch, Lisburn and the second phase of Downpatrick will be  delivered by October 2011.

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you undertake to review the Question Time  session held with the Minister of Education? Many sides of the House are  concerned that she consistently fails to answer or address the questions posed  to her. That leads to background noise in the Chamber, and I am mindful of your  earlier comments about that. I remind the House that all Ministers have a duty  to come to the House for Question Time and to give proper and full answers to  the questions posed.</p>
