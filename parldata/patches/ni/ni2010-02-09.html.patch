     <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you will appreciate that  both Mr Shannon and Mr Butler, in common with Mr Burns, raised similar issues  in their supplementary questions. The bottom line is that I am determined to  provide the best possible housing resources with the limited money that is  available to me. That is good use of public money.</p>
     <p class="H5StageHeading">Ross Road  Flats and Ross Cottages</p>
     <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development why she is maintaining Ross Road flats and  Ross Cottages despite the detrimental impact these dwellings are having on residents  in the Falls area.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 738/10<a name="AQO738/10" id="AQO738/10"></a>)</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Social Development</strong>: I have visited the lower Falls area, and I am acutely  aware of the problems that are faced by residents and the local community.  There are a total of 20 properties in that area; 12 flats; two houses, and six  cottages. All except three are currently occupied. Those homes are just over 30  years old. The Housing Executive has maintained them well during those years,  although I accept that further work is now needed at those properties. I  understand that the Housing Executive is already in discussions with residents  and the local community on how work can be taken forward.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">The underlying problem is not the flats themselves, but the  actions of people who come into the area and engage in antisocial behaviour and  serious criminality. It is primarily a community-safety issue, which the wider  community must work to address, alongside elected representatives and relevant  statutory agencies.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister told the House that  she has visited the lower Falls on a number of occasions. However, has she ever  visited the Ross Road  flats and Ross Cottages? I do not believe that she has. Is she willing to meet  local representatives, political representatives and resident groups in that  area? It is important to point out that the flats are the focus of antisocial  behaviour in the community. Many residents in the community are calling for the  demolition of the flats. I urge the Minister to ensure that they are  demolished.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There is no single or simple answer to the Member&rsquo;s  question. A wide range of issues will always have to be taken into  consideration. I want to increase the housing stock, not reduce it. Paul Maskey  asked me whether I would visit the Ross    Road flats. I await the revised proposals from the  Housing Executive, and I will be happy to meet the residents after I have  considered those. Within the past month, I met some of the residents on two  separate occasions. I met several of them at Conway Mill and at the official  opening of St Peter&rsquo;s Immaculata youth club. On each occasion, I said that I  would be happy to meet them at some future stage to discuss their concerns.</p>
