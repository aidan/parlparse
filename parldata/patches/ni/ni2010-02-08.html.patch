       <p class="B3BodyText">We are where we are, with a good service that could be  improved by a adding a specialist service. I ask Members to recognise that the  implementation of that specialist service will require extra investment.</p>
       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It gives me great pleasure to make  a winding-up speech on the debate. I thank all Members who took part and  supported the motion. I want to give special mention to Research and Library  Services for providing an extremely comprehensive research pack. In particular,  I thank Dr Janice Thompson, who enabled the Committee to make comparisons with England, Scotland  and Wales.  It is always useful to make comparisons with our nearest neighbours.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I want to take the opportunity to welcome the Minister to a  debate. He will probably want a gold star for finding the time to attend  today&rsquo;s debate, but he received a demerit for his non-attendance at last  Tuesday&rsquo;s debate on cancer treatment.</p>

Furthermore, the debate concerned a social  security issue, and no Minister was named until the last minute. For such snide  remarks to be made in a discussion on an important issue &mdash;</p>

       <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  It was not a point of order, but I am glad that the Minister made the point.  Between 27 April 2009 and 2 February 2010, the Minister attended 20 of 51  health debates in the Chamber. I welcome him to today&rsquo;s debate, but the lack of  ministerial attendance on Tuesdays is an issue.</p>
       <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) for  providing the Committee with a briefing paper in preparation for today&rsquo;s  debate. In common with others, the Royal College of Midwives supports the  implementation of specialist services for perinatal mental health.</p>
