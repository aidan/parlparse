 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ba mhaith liom an r&uacute;n a  mholadh. I move the motion.</p>
 		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  The issues of equality and human rights are important, and they should  certainly be embedded in the heart of our vision for Northern Ireland. We can trace  those issues back to the time of the Enlightenment, especially to the time of  the Scottish Enlightenment. In fact, one of our local folk, Francis Hutcheson  from County Down, contributed much to the development of the Scottish  Enlightenment. These are issues that we should feel comfortable with.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the motion gives me cause for concern. The issue  of a single equality Bill is a long-standing one. The proposer of the motion  has mentioned the extensive consultations that have already taken place on the  issue &mdash; but how extensive and inclusive were those consultations? I suspect  that if we went out into the centre of Belfast, or any other part of Northern  Ireland, and asked people on the street what they knew about a single equality  Bill, or whether they were aware of the consultations that took place or had  been asked to contribute to them, the vast majority would say that they knew  nothing about it.</p>

 		    <p class="B3BodyText">The reason for that could be that so much of the  consultation has been conducted through what is generally described as &ldquo;the  voluntary sector&rdquo;. I refer to some figures about that sector, which has taken  such a key role through organisations such as the Northern Ireland Council for  Voluntary Action (NICVA) on those matters. The monitoring reports of the  Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI) for the years 2002-04 show an  employment pattern of significant and increasing disadvantage &mdash; some might say,  discrimination &mdash; against the Protestant community in the voluntary sector. The  2004 employment figures for NICVA, which is  supposed to represent the community, show that only 40% of its staff  came from the Protestant community, whereas 60% came from the Roman Catholic  community. Other key organisations in that sector &mdash; for example, the Rural  Community Network (RCN) &mdash; have reached the stage at which their representation  from the Protestant community is less than 25%. Consequently, there is an issue  about how inclusive and representative much of the consultation has really  been.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is another matter to which I wish to draw Members&rsquo;  attention. We are grateful to the Equality Commission &mdash; the key organisation in  the equality sector &mdash; for sending a briefing by email yesterday in which it  calls for greater enforcement powers. It might wish to use those powers against  itself. This is an organisation that is  tasked with monitoring and changing employment patterns in every section  of Northern Ireland society, yet it cannot get that right itself.  Among its staff there is a 60% representation from the Roman Catholic  community &mdash; only 40% are drawn from the Protestant  community. That is a deterioration from 2002, when Protestants  represented 44% of the workforce and 56% came from the Roman Catholic  community.</p>
 		    <p class="B3BodyText">Key organisations in the voluntary sector, and the Equality  Commission itself, have significant work to do to make themselves fit for  purpose, so that there can be real debate and engagement on the issue of  equality, the type of legislation that is required and, indeed, the sort of  commission that is needed. We must get those matters  right. It is an absolute disgrace that the Equality Commission, year  after year, has abjectly failed to improve the position of its own employment  pattern.</p>
