     <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 arises from a recommendation made by the  Regional Development Committee, having sought advice from the Examiner of  Statutory Rules during the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. I thank Committee members  for their helpful recommendations, their detailed scrutiny of the Bill with all  interested parties and their timely consideration of the Bill.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 1 to clause 3 concerns the delegated powers of  the Bill, which currently provides at clause 3(10) that the first permit  regulations to be made would be subject to the affirmative resolution  procedure, but subsection 11 provides that any other regulations are to be made  by negative resolution. The Regional Development Committee has recommended that  an amendment be made to widen clause 3(10). Consequently, the first set of  regulations under section 10 and any subsequent regulations that create a  criminal offence or increases the penalty for an existing offence may not be  made unless a draft of them has been laid before the Assembly and approved by  resolution.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation and therefore  propose to amend clause 3(10) to provide for permit regulations that create an  offence or increase a criminal penalty to be subject to Assembly approval.</p>

During the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage debate, I indicated  the Committee&rsquo;s support for the principles of the Bill. The Bill stood referred  to the Regional Development Committee on 27 January 2010 and my Committee  completed its Committee Stage in order that its report was printed on 26 May  2010.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">During the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage, the Committee for  Regional Development sought evidence from a range of stakeholder organisations  and a number of Departments. The Committee also took evidence from departmental  officials. All of that evidence was taken on board when producing the final  report.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the two amendments being debated, the  Committee sought and received clarification from the Department for Regional  Development on a range of issues, including the cost of issuing permits for  works on roads; the need for notice periods before works on roads commenced;  the guidance, as against regulations, to be developed for events on roads;  managing the impact of works on roads to peak-time traffic flows; the impact of  permit scheme proposals on the extension of gas and other utility networks; and  the meaning of &ldquo;special events&rdquo; in relation to the closure of roads.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also recommended that the operation of a  permit scheme to enable the works on roads is monitored on an ongoing basis and  reviewed after three years to ascertain whether the co-ordination of works on  roads has continued to improve. This debate is not the time to go into any  details of those topics, and I will save my further remarks for the Bill&rsquo;s  Final Stage. However, before I address amendment No 1, with Mr Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s  indulgence, I take this opportunity to thank those who responded to the  Committee&rsquo;s call for evidence and the Department for its co-operation during  the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage.</p>
