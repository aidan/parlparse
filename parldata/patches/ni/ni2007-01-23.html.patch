 	  	<p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dodds has injected a dose of reality into the debate. Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd came out with that phrase that we hear ad infinitum, that if the  Assembly were back, we could all do wonderful things. Mr Dodds reminded us that  this is a parity issue about which the Assembly could do precious little. It is  the responsibility of any Assembly to highlight issues and to speak on behalf  of people, especially those who live on the margins. I have spent the best  years of my life as a public representative, trying to improve the lot of those  who live on the margins. Therefore, I consider the Welfare Reform Bill to be  essential, and I welcome its aims and objectives. I hope that the Bill is  enacted, because simply talking about its objectives is not enough.</p>
 	  	<p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that Mr McCarthy, a gentleman whom I hold in very  high regard, is in the Chamber. When I was Minister for Social Development, I  remember vividly taking some flak when I turned down the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  suggestion that all pensions be increased by &pound;5. That was a laudable  suggestion, but Mr McCarthy came to agree with me that it was a ridiculous  suggestion because it could never be achieved. Northern Ireland has a block  grant and that fell outside our allotment; it was a parity issue and could not  be done. I was pleased to learn that Mr McCarthy now accepts that fact.</p>
