If united, the Government in the Republic  of Ireland and the Executive will be able to achieve greater  leverage, funding and support for Northern Ireland.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:6.5pt;"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: Obviously. The Assembly must have as  much support and as many friends as possible. The First Minister has said that  on several occasions. President Barroso&rsquo;s visit to this Building occurred  chiefly as a result of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s encouragement. To gain the greatest  advantage for the people we represent, we must use all the resources and good  will that are available to us. I have no doubt that the people we work with in  the Irish Government will be our friends at court.</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The junior Ministers are assisting the First Minister and me to  take forward our important commitments and priorities with regard to children  and young people. They will have a key role in driving the 10-year strategy for  children and young people and in setting in  place the most appropriate arrangements for its delivery.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with the First Minister and me, the junior Ministers  have already met with the Commissioner for Children and Young People and have  begun a series of meetings with non-governmental organisations. A further  schedule of visits, to take place in the autumn, is being arranged with  organisations that work with children and young people. That will help to  inform us of the key issues that face children and young people.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to place on record my thanks to Ms Ramsey and  other representatives of the all-party group on children and young people for  their positive contribution to this agenda. It is important that we find an  appropriate way for that role and engagement to continue.</p>
