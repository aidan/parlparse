 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned bigger issues such as capital values  and metering. We will now have the opportunity to debate those in the House.  The panel made it clear that the second phase of the report will examine very closely affordability and how an increased  contribution from domestic consumers towards water and sewerage services can be  mitigated in order that the worst off do not  suffer as a result of the charges. As  I said, the panel comprises people who have a broad range of experience  &mdash; particularly the chairperson &mdash; on matters that relate to water poverty. I am  confident that the panel, in engagement with the parties that have an interest  in the matter and with all the other stake&shy;holders, will draw up robust  affordability propositions that the Executive can consider and that the  Assembly can decide on.</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Given that many thousands of senior citizens throughout Northern Ireland  have indicated that they wish to have water meters installed in their homes,  will the Minister give an assurance that that option will still be available to  those people who are over the age of 60 who wish to avail themselves of it?</p>
 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Murphy</strong>:  That option is enshrined in current legislation, and it is to that legislation  that the water company operates. Until the  Executive decide otherwise and introduce their own legislation, that  will remain the case. The Executive must decide whether they wish to pursue a  different objective for pensioners, and it would be up to the House to agree  any new legislation.</p>

Together with the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, we had the opportunity to brief them on the exciting  economic opportunities here, and to encourage them to consider investing. The  visit was initiated by President Bush&rsquo;s special envoy, Paula Dobriansky, as  part of her very effective focus in securing support for the planned investment  conference here next May. We believe that the conference will mark a massive  step forward in helping to grow a dynamic and innovative economy, which is one of the key priorities in our draft  Programme for Government.

Alternatively &mdash; and this is the power that came in three  years ago under article 65A &mdash; the Department may make a provisional tree  preservation order that takes immediate effect on the date specified, providing  protection for the trees. A tree preservation order with immediate provisional  effect must be confirmed &mdash; rather like spot listing &mdash; within six months of the  date of the order, otherwise the protection afforded to the trees expires.</p>
