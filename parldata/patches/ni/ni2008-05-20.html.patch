 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn noted the mixed message in the report and how  the advisory council wanted to keep cannabis classified as a class-C drug but  also referred to the mental-health and other problems associated with the drug,  which I referred to at the beginning of my winding-up speech. He also spoke of  the progression of young people using so-called soft drugs moving on to harder  drugs. Although some commentators say that there is no link, it is clear that  young people who start taking cannabis &mdash; and who get into the habit of taking  cannabis &mdash; are more likely to experiment with other drugs and move on to  ecstasy, LSD or other harder drugs, and that is a real problem.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague George Robinson spoke of the local impact in  Limavady, and the number of arrests and drug-related crime in that area. The  statistics in Limavady largely reflect what we are seeing in Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole.  He referred to the different types of stronger drugs, how dangerous they are  and the impact that they have on the mind.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey said that I should take credit for making the  Prime Minister bow his knee to this Assembly or to me personally. However, she  said that we are dealing with a serious issue, and it is important that we get  that message across. Cannabis is a serious issue, and it has a serious impact  not only on society &mdash; as Ms Ramsey said &mdash; but on an individual&rsquo;s health. She  referred to the social impact of the drug, and that is important. She also said  that it was wrong to declassify the drug four years ago, and referred to  yesterday&rsquo;s debate and the link with depression.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ramsey</strong>:  The Member has taken on board my point that he should not run away from the  fact that he may be putting the British Government under pressure. Will he take  on board my point that he should have a word in the Finance Minister&rsquo;s ear to  ensure that adequate resources are put into the community and voluntary sector  to tackle this issue?</p>

 	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  was going to refer to that point. Of course it is important that we have  adequate resources, and it is important that Departments ensure that the money  that they are streaming into various agencies goes to the right places, which  can make a real difference to the lives of young people and local communities.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Basil McCrea referred to the fact that cannabis can lead  to societal problems and what he called &ldquo;risky behaviour&rdquo;. He spoke of the  difficulties involved not only with cannabis but with alcohol, and that is a  fair point. He also referred to the role of parents, which is important. The  decision to reclassify cannabis four years ago undermined the role that parents  play in the cannabis debate. Parents try to discourage young people from  underage drinking and from taking cannabis. However, the Government sent out  the wrong message and undermined parents when they decided to declassify the  drug. Mr McCrea also spoke of the link with organised crime &mdash; as did other  Members &mdash; and referred to the recent &pound;50,000 fine on the north coast. He also  rubbished the myth that personal use does not have a knock-on effect. That is a  fair point.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Claire McGill spoke about the message being sent out to  young people, and the number of families that have been ruined by drugs. As  always, she referred to her own area of Strabane and Omagh and the impact that  drugs were having there, and she revealed some startling statistics.</p>
