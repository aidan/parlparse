 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see that every child gets the best possible start  in life. Children and families are at the centre of what we do. Opportunities  are as important at the preschool stage as  at other stages in a child&rsquo;s education. I want to ensure that this  Assembly is committed to providing quality choices for those parents who wish  their child to participate in the preschool environment.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">By the time that  children start to attend the preschool setting,  they will already have had a variety of experiences and developed in a  number of ways. In order to use, and build on, the learning that has taken  place in the home and its immediate environment, adults should provide children  with a rich variety of play activities and other experiences in a stimulating  and challenging environment. The focus should be on allowing children to learn  without experiencing a sense of failure.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Young children require a safe, secure, healthy, stimulating  environment, with adequate supervision; appropriate periods of time for  learning through sustained involvement in play; and adults who treat them as  individuals and sensitively participate in their play. Given these needs, it  follows that young children require a curriculum that meets their physical,  social, emotional and cognitive needs at their particular stage of development.  Their curriculum should motivate, challenge and stimulate them; and should be  broad and balanced, allowing children to make choices and providing them with  opportunities through play and other experiences. Unfortunately, unless more  preschool places are made available in Lagan Valley,  we will not provide young children with those very important requirements. That  is nothing short of a disgrace, and the Minister, her Department and the boards  need to investigate it as a matter of urgency.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to what everyone said. There are big  issues for the Department, and for us as a society. I want to assure everyone  that I am committed to ensuring that all children have the opportunity to avail  themselves of preschool education, regardless of the community that they come  from, of whether they come from our new communities that have come from  different parts of the world, and of whether they learn through English or  Irish.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007-08, I have made the following resources available:  Sure Start, &pound;12 million; statutory preschool provision, &pound;34 million; and  voluntary, private, preschool provision, &pound;10 million. That represents an  overall commitment of &pound;56 million. In addition, in the 2007 Budget I secured &pound;8  million to enable early-years services to be funded, plus a further &pound;8 million  over the next three years for service development.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with everybody who said that the first few years of  a child&rsquo;s life are of critical importance to their future development and  well-being. It is during those early months and years that a high percentage of  children&rsquo;s learning takes place, attitudes are formed, first relationships are  made, concepts are developed and the  foundation of all later skills and learning is laid.</p>
