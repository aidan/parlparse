     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  It goes to show the sincerity of the Health Minister, who, of course, is an  Ulster Unionist. I also pay tribute to him &mdash;</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must insist that the Member comes to his question.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  We welcome the health centre in Banbridge, and the people of Banbridge welcome it.  It is long overdue. If funding had been available to the Minister, what  services and additional improvements could he have made in the Health Service?  Again, well done, Minister.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Service and Public Safety</strong>: I referred to the capital project  at Altnagelvin. I also had a strong desire for the building of the new  children&rsquo;s hospital at the Royal. Members will be aware that the environment in  the children&rsquo;s hospital is extremely poor. It is a 70-year-old or 80-year-old  hospital, and that is where we put the most vulnerable members of our society:  our children. The service there is very good, but the environment is extremely  poor. That is another example of the schemes &mdash; I have pages of them &mdash; that  require to be done.</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 30-odd years, health has not had the  investment that it should have had, because we funded &pound;500 million a year to  fight a terrorist war. That is where the money went and, after all that time,  there is a deficit in health, roads, education and so on. We need to fill that  deficit and address it. Health is definitely not getting the priority that it  requires. For example, when you consider that double the capital is going into  roads as is going into health, it seems that we prefer bypasses to hospitals. That  will be an issue for the next Assembly.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Unfortunately, I cannot stand here as  a representative for Foyle and say, &ldquo;Well done, Minister&rdquo;. The announcement  that the Altnagelvin radiotherapy centre is to be mothballed or deferred will  be met with widespread disappointment and anger in Derry  city and across the wider north-west. In fact, many people will say to me that  this decision may put lives at risk as well as causing tremendous upset. Will  the Minister agree that it is time to stop treating Altnagelvin&rsquo;s radiotherapy  centre as a political football? It is time for the Health Minister not to wind  down towards the end of this mandate but to crank up efforts to resolve the  issue and sit down with the Finance Minister in the North and the Health  Minister in the Republic and deal with the matter once and for all so that it  proceeds apace.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have sat down with the Finance  Minister here on a number of occasions, and this is the result. I have made  attempts to talk to the Health Minister in the South by phone, but, clearly, he  is very busy. We have to have that commitment from the Irish Republic  because one third of the patient flow will come from Donegal. I understand  that, with the new cancer centre in Galway,  the need might not be as great. That is why their support, which I got previously  from Mary Harney, is crucial.</p>
