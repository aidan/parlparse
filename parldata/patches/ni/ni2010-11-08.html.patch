     <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of non-farming rural dwellers is one from which  we do not need to move away. We need to continue to work on that issue, and I  put it to the House that I will work with every party, other Ministers and  Committee Chairpersons to try to identify a satisfactory resolution. The issue  will be very difficult to resolve and there will not be a perfect solution.  However, I am committed to continuing to work to find a solution.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  In relation to the Planning Service&rsquo;s workload, does the Minister agree that  the longer we try to put off the subgroup meeting, the more cases will be  referred back to the Planning Service and, indeed, the Planning Appeals  Commission? Does he agree that to create more efficiency and savings, it would  be better that the subgroup met to have a further discussion and, hopefully, to  agree a better way forward?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: PPS 21 is a final document. When we arrive at a resolution  to the issue of non-farming rural dwellers, the decision will be applied as an  addendum to PPS 21. The planning reform Bill would give planning powers to  local government and put decision-making in the hands of locally elected people  who know, for example, Fermanagh and south Down better than I do. I am  committed to the planning reform Bill coming before the House. I hope that  others are as committed to ensuring that we pass that form of local democracy  down to local people so that they can make those decisions. I am very happy to  do that on the basis of checks and balances, as identified in the local  government reorganisation Bill, being put in place. That is the way forward.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCrea:</strong> I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to working with all parties, Committees and  Members to ensure that PPS 21 and the issue of non-farming rural dwellers are  kept on the table. The Minister referred to other planning policy statements  that he has had to bring forward. Will he be so gracious as to inform the House  which of those are outstanding and explain any reasons why he has been unable  to bring them to the House so that the people of Northern Ireland can benefit?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment:</strong> We are looking at a number of planning policy statements,  which will need to go out to public consultation. One planning policy statement  relates to enabling development, which would help us to deliver something that  would benefit local communities through tourism, recreation and built heritage.  Another relates to economic considerations and would give substantially  stronger powers to planners to make determining decisions when there are real,  tangible economic benefits to applications or when there is an economic  downside. For example, some planning applications may result in the loss of  hundreds of jobs. We do not have as much power as we could have for ensuring  that determining decisions are made. Those planning policy statements are all  in the mix, and I trust that they will be brought before the Executive very  soon, to allow for public consultation.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">The planning reform Bill will be the mechanism to  fundamentally reform planning and to make the system much more responsive and  beneficial to the needs of local communities than is the case.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree:</strong> Could the Minister give his assessment of the number of planning applications  for new houses in the countryside that have been granted since the introduction  of PPS 21? What controls are in place to ensure that development does not  become disproportionate to the level that was envisaged during the formation of  PPS 21?</p>

     <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the European human rights protections regarding  languages apply only to minority languages that are indigenous to the area.  That is a somewhat narrow view that neglects the much wider diversity and  language need in our midst. Since the EU expansion in 2004, we have seen a huge  increase in the number of migrants coming to Northern Ireland whose first  language is not English. It is estimated that there are up to 80,000 migrants  from across the world in Northern    Ireland. It is likely that there are more  people speaking Polish or Chinese than speaking Irish on a daily basis in our  towns and cities.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Ethnic minority communities &mdash; both long-established and more  recent arrivals &mdash; would like to see a wide-ranging minority language strategy  to address two issues. First, they require more information on services to be  available in their language to make it easier for them to understand  governmental structures and access essential services in order to better  integrate into society. Since 2004, for example, Northern Ireland Health and  Social Care&rsquo;s interpreting service has received over 150,000 requests for its  services in more than 40 different languages. Services such as those are vital  for the day-to-day lives of residents of Northern Ireland. It is a matter of  need, rather than ideology. A minority language strategy could mainstream  translation and interpreting into all government Departments and statutory  bodies that have contact with ethnic minorities to ensure that services are  easily available to everyone.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, they would like some recognition of mother-tongue  teaching for the children, as those communities are entitled to keep their  language alive by passing it from generation to generation. That is no  different to learning Irish or Ulster Scots. Currently, community organisations  such as the Polish Association, the Chinese Welfare Association and the Belfast  Islamic Centre provide mother-tongue teaching to children without any public  funding at all, compared to the &pound;6 million given by DEL in 2009 to the Ulster Scots and Irish  language bodies.</p>
