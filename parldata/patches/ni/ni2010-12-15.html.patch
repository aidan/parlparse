     <p class="B3BodyText">It also became clear during our engagements that a big  debate is obviously happening in European states about their own budgets. That  is a state of negotiation that will continue over the the coming weeks and  months. We were obviously there to lobby on our own behalf, and we were  certainly allowed to do that. However, it was clear that many people thought  that they had the opportunity to lobby us to get us to influence others about  their contribution to the European Union. In short, we were very encouraged by  what we heard. However, the outcome of those programmes will depend on the  outcome of the negotiations that are taking place between member states.</p>

At  this stage, suffice it to say that we recognise that a lot of Europe&rsquo;s approach  to our moving forward substantially on the issue of Peace IV and the  continuation of the International Fund for Ireland will depend on what it hears  from other areas. For example, we all know that, at present, the Committee on  Appropriations in the United States  is dealing with the issue of the contribution that the US may make to the International Fund for Ireland.</p>
