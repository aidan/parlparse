 <p class="B3BodyText">I recently visited another company in west Belfast, Label One, which has opened new  offices in Ballygomartin. I was pleased to be at that opening, and I hope to  visit that constituency again before the end of March.</p>
 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I assure the Minister that her answer was well and truly received and heard on  these Benches.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister inform us of the current position of the West Belfast and Greater Shankill Task Forces initiative?</p>
-<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise and Investment</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. I issued a draft Executive paper in June  2009 outlining options on the way forward for the task force initiative, and I  await a response from several colleagues, receipt of which will allow the issue  to be discussed by the Executive. The draft Executive paper details options for  taking the initiative forward. One of them is to transfer responsibility for  the initiative to OFMDFM. However, that is a matter for colleagues to decide. I  hope that we will be able to discuss that Executive paper very soon.</p>

 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  The Minister referred to her powers of persuasion and embarrassment. Perhaps  she could use them in this instance. Given that many Northern Ireland firms  bask in the status that a Queen&rsquo;s Award to Industry bestows, does she not think  that it is unfortunate that some employers in the private sector are indicating  to their employees that they may not be able to have the day off for the royal  wedding in April, unlike their colleagues in the public sector?</p>
 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I very much hope that that is not the case. Apart from anything  else, productivity would be particularly low if people were forced to work on a  day when their colleagues in the public sector were enjoying the celebration of  our future king&rsquo;s nuptials in London.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to some respite from the canvassing trail on  that day and to enjoying it. I heard that productivity was very low yesterday  because people took sickies. Someone said that 350,000 people took a sick day  yesterday. I certainly do not want to see people being forced to take a sick  day. I would much rather that their employer gave them a holiday to celebrate  what will be a national event.</p>

 <p class="B3BodyText">Other public representatives who tried to contact the  Housing Executive or the housing associations will know that it was absolutely  impossible to get through on the phone. I spent over an hour on the phone to BT  on Boxing Day trying to get what I thought was a fault on the line fixed, but  there was no fault. I then phoned the PSNI, also on Boxing Day, and reported  the fact that the so-called emergency number that we were given was not  working, and I asked whether the PSNI could intervene. However, the PSNI could  not get through either.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, we resorted to sourcing plumbers and electricians  to get emergency repairs carried out. Despite the chaos, Minister, far from  admitting that mistakes were made and that lessons needed to be learned &mdash;</p>
 <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  We do all recognise that everything could have been done a lot better. However,  it is probably worth noting that, out of the thousands of calls made on 28  December, 87% were answered, in one way or another, by the Housing Executive.  Unfortunately, out of the thousands made, less than 1% of calls were  successfully answered by Northern Ireland Water. Perhaps being able to put  those two figures in contrast helps us to understand the scope of what was  happening inside the Housing Executive and inside Northern Ireland Water.</p>
-<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  In a direct response to me, the Minister for Social Development insisted that  the offices were open during normal working hours over the Christmas period.  However, the people of Derry and the people in  many other areas wanted the offices open during abnormal hours, such as on  Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day &mdash; not just normal working hours.  Whatever about 28 December, we were dealing with an absolutely massive problem  in our constituency throughout those three days, and nobody from the Housing  Executive or the housing associations was there to assist. No matter what party  Members represent, I am saying that people in our community &mdash; those who were  experiencing problems &mdash; realised that they could not get through on the  emergency number. It was not only elected representatives who had that problem;  it affected many others. Indeed, it was community activists, Sinn F&eacute;in  activists and representatives who were on the street.</p>

 <p class="B3BodyText">In many cases, senior Housing Executive staff could not be  contacted at all. When my office managed to get in contact with one senior  Housing Executive officer on his mobile phone &mdash; this goes back to the point  that was made earlier &mdash; he was not at all pleased. He was not pleased that we  were interrupting his outing to the Boxing Day sales at Junction One. He almost  gave out to us because he was on holiday. Good for him that he had a few days  off, because the vast majority of people were dealing with their roofs falling  in, and there was nobody there to help them on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and  Boxing Day. That is the reality of the situation that we were facing. While  thousands of tenants were struggling to get by without heat or water, senior  Housing Executive managers were enjoying their Christmas holidays as usual.  Clearly, they did not think that it was a problem. Clearly, no contingency plan  was in place.</p>
 <p class="B3BodyText">None of this is about political point scoring, regardless  of what Members are feeling about where the motion emanated from. If the motion  had come from the party opposite, we would have supported it, such was the  scale of the problem that we were collectively dealing with. The motion is  about ensuring that lessons are learnt. Therefore, an investigation into NI  Water is justified. I hope that we will get to the bottom of that situation,  fix the problem and learn the lessons, just as we need to learn the lessons  with regard to the Housing Executive to ensure that there is no repeat  performance. The mistakes that happened over the Christmas period can be dealt  with in future, and an independent investigation will achieve that. Many people  were on the receiving end.</p>
