 	      <p class="B3BodyText">The hard-working rural population in Northern Ireland  is often left isolated because, at present, it is without ambulance cover. We  must, therefore, ensure that a speedy response to emergency ambulance call-outs  is provided in rural Northern    Ireland. It is fair comment to say that the  Minister envisages such provision being delivered by rapid-response vehicles.  As has been stated previously, perhaps those vehicles are well suited to being  a first response to emergency calls in urban areas, but they are not the answer  in the rural communities. They are a waste of the resources at the Ambulance  Service&rsquo;s disposal.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Locally located ambulances will reduce response times and  ensure that patients can be transferred to hospital without the requirement of  a second vehicle. Mr McQuillan pointed out that the strategic location of  ambulances in rural areas could be accommodated with the co-operation of local  medical practices. I hope that the Minister will seek to expand such provision  throughout Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  more remote areas. I agree entirely with my colleague&rsquo;s remark that time is of  the essence in responding to emergencies. Much is always made of the golden  hour &mdash; or, as it is called now, the golden half-hour &mdash; being critical for  patients. If that golden half-hour is so vital, let us strive to ensure that an  ambulance is dispatched, rather an RRV.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said previously that, if every minute is essential  in securing the best possible outcome for a patient &mdash; as I had personal  experience of four years ago &mdash; saving lives and reducing hospital admissions,  then the idea of strategic location of ambulances is an essential element of  that concept. I fear that otherwise a life will be lost. I stand by my  comments. Let us put an end to the disadvantage that people in living in rural areas  feel when they require an ambulance. The Minister and the Assembly must ensure  that rural communities are treated with equality. I support the motion.</p>
-	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services, and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank Adrian  McQuillan for tabling the motion and Lord Morrow for seconding it. This is the  third debate that we have had on the Ambulance Service since the 7 October. On each  occasion, Members have highlighted the importance of ambulance services in  rural communities. Just last week, the Assembly discussed ambulance services in  Omagh and North Antrim, and during the debate in October other members raised  concerns about their local areas, including the Ards Peninsula  and Enniskillen.</p>

 	      <p class="B3BodyText">On each occasion, concerns were expressed about the changes  in service provision proposed by the Ambulance Service in response to the  Executive&rsquo;s requirement for efficiency savings. I would point out to Mr Craig  that Peter Robinson described them as efficiencies &mdash; not cuts. That is what we  are working on. I am required to implement a 3% efficiency saving, and when Mr  Robinson, as Finance Minister, talked about those requirements, he referred to  them as efficiencies. He was right to call them efficiencies; they are not  cuts.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity afforded by these debates and  recent oral questions, of which there have been a number, and views expressed  by the general public, to confirm that the Ambulance Service proposals are not  about cutting services. They are about providing a more effective and  responsive Ambulance Service to the people of Northern   Ireland, and increasing access to skilled paramedic care  for all the people of Northern    Ireland, no matter where they live.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said it before, and I am happy to say it again: I am  committed to providing a quality, fit-for-purpose, twenty-first century  Ambulance Service for all the people of Northern Ireland, including those  in rural areas. Our emergency response capability will be increased by these  changes, not reduced.</p>
