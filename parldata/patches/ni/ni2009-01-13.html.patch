 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 42(4)(c) also requires us to explain, if  appropriate, any steps taken to minimise the future use of the accelerated  passage procedure. I am aware that some members of the Committee for the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister suggested decoupling clauses 1  and 2 of the Bill. However, they need to be aware that the Bill is about  addressing, as a matter of urgency, hardship, whether arising from unforeseen  circumstances or from a person&rsquo;s experience of poverty, deprivation and social  exclusion. The Executive need powers to respond urgently in either situation.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our experience since restoration has shown that, as an  Executive, we need to be in a position to react quickly to unforeseen events  and to ensure that measures can be put in place urgently in order to deal with  inadequacies in current provisions for tackling poverty, social exclusion, or  patterns of deprivation. The Bill provides us with the legislative basis upon  which to do that, and it is important that it be enacted at the earliest  opportunity. We hope that the powers that the Executive will have under the  Bill will avoid the need for urgent Bills to tackle unforeseen events in the  future or gaps in the arrangements to tackle poverty, social exclusion or  deprivation.</p>
 	      <p class="B3BodyText">We assure the Assembly that, where time permits, our  practice will be to take Bills through the Assembly under the normal process,  as we have done, for example, in relation to the Public Authorities (Reform)  Bill.</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Gallagher began the debate by proposing the  motion. He expressed the deep concern in the community throughout the North of  Ireland about this issue. He mentioned that the Bain Report highlighted the  effect of declining rolls, and he called on the Department of Education to  provide leadership on this issue.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">We had to wait a considerable length of time for the sustainable  schools policy to be published. Mr Gallagher referred to the somewhat  mysterious emergence of the policy last night on the Internet without prior  notice being given to any parties or to the Education Committee. Although that  is regrettable, we should be glad that we have the policy now at long last.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher also referred to the closure of the Duke of  Westminster High School in his area and of the threat that St Mary&rsquo;s High  School in Brollagh faces. In the company of Mr Gallagher, the Chairman of the  Committee and I visited St Mary&rsquo;s. We were extremely impressed by the high  quality of education that was provided in that school.</p>
