         <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to what Robin Newton had to say. I apologise for  agreeing with him on three or four points, because that will probably not go  down terribly well.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">However, he was right to say that we must work  collectively, and he was correct in saying that the upgrading of skills is key  if the economy is to emerge from the crisis. He used a good turn of phrase when  he said that we must not mistake &ldquo;activity for action&rdquo;. I agree with Mr Newton  that there must be a balanced approach to dealing with FDI, as well as SMEs.</p>
