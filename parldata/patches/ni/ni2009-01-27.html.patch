         <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member of the House should recognise the need to make  a provision to allow the payments to be made. Those payments could never have  been made last year. They would have required funds to be put in place, which  became available through the December monitoring round process &mdash; a process that  the Executive accelerated. Normally, the results of the December monitoring  round are not announced until this time of the year, but the December  monitoring round was brought forward so that the funds would be available in  order to give us the flexibility to make the payments. Even then, there will be  administrative requirements to be met, and after the passage of the Bill, the  Social Development Minister will require time to put those in place.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>The third issue that  Members referred to was a &ldquo;power grab&rdquo;. The answer to that is simple</strong>: we do  not need any new legislation if we want to grab more power for OFMDFM. The  enabling legislation for that lies in section 17 of the Northern Ireland Act  1998 and in a later Order, which allows us to vary the functions of  Departments. We needed no further legislation if we wanted to grab power. The  powers that are being sought under clause 2 relate to issues that are already  the responsibility of OFMDFM. Those two facts put to death the suggestion of a  power grab, the prospect of which was raised publicly for purely  party-political purposes.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth issue concerns an area with which I have more  sympathy, and it generated proposals for several amendments. Members sought to  specify, in the Bill, normal processes that would, in practice, have occurred anyway.  I understand that Members &mdash; the male Members in the Assembly, at least &mdash; like  to have a belt and braces approach. However, it is unnecessary to burden legislation  with references to things that happen anyway. That is the case both with  respect to duplication, such as putting the requirement for Executive decisions  on the face of the Bill, and to some of the procedures suggested in the  amendments at Further Consideration Stage. Neither the deputy First Minister  nor I have any desire to dodge Committees or to go behind their backs with  regard to issues that may emerge from the Bill.</p>

         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate the First Minister giving away. I feared that he was about to move  away from the point that I wish to raise.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">I take entirely the point that he made about Ministers reporting  on schemes to their departmental Committees. However, if I may put to the First  Minister a point that I put to the deputy First Minister yesterday about  amendment No 13, which was defeated &mdash; the idea that the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister should provide a general report annually to the Assembly  on the overall operation of such schemes. Perhaps the First Minister can give  me a better answer than the deputy First Minister did yesterday as to why that  amendment was rejected.</p>
         <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will give the Member three answers. My first is that it may  well be that for any purpose after its first purpose there will be no further need  for the Bill. Do we put in legislation a requirement for the First Minister and  the deputy First Minister to give annual reports if the Bill is not used during  the course of a year? Do we include in the Bill a requirement to come before  the Assembly when the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister already performs a particular role by scrutinising what the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister do? Should we do that when  existing procedures allow any party to table a motion that would have to be  answered by the deputy First Minister or myself on these matters?</p>

         <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have decided to twist the facts to try to make  out that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has deprived the Department for  Social Development of funding. Every Member and every Minister knows that the  Department submitted bids for funding way in excess of what was going to be the  reality. Those seven bids were, I believe, for almost twice the moneys  available. Therefore, I hope that members of the Minister&rsquo;s party will come  clean and admit that the Department for Social Development and social housing  are very much a priority for the Executive.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that there are still tough choices to  make, but they must be made based on fact, not on speculation and political  agendas. There is no doubt that the economy will take time to recover, and that  it will, effectively, budget plans for some time. Therefore, all Departments  must make their core targets those that were set out in the Programme for  Government. However, it is a relief that we have a steady hand on the financial  wheel at the Department of Finance and Personnel to ensure that those targets  are met without lumbering future generations with debts, which some Members  think that we should take on and expect our children and grandchildren to pay  for.

         <p class="B3BodyText">The Department made a bid for &pound;200 million for the  budgetary period 2008-2011 to provide funding for councils to cover up to 50%  of the overall capital costs of compliance with the EU landfill directive  targets. The Committee has been advised by the Department that the three waste  management groups established to address the waste management needs of the  North&rsquo;s 26 councils have not been in place long enough to be able to use the resources  that have been made available by the strategic waste infrastructure fund. The  Department now wants &mdash; on its terms &mdash; to re-phase the money into the next  budgetary period.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dodds referred to that unspent money in his strategic  stocktake statement last week. He stopped short of giving a commitment that  sufficient funding would be found for waste management in the next budgeting  round. That is particularly worrying when considered alongside the fact that  there is likely to be a net reduction in the block grant &mdash; relative to the  position when the budget was agreed last January &mdash; over the period 2009-2011.</p>
         <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of waste management must not be  underestimated. We are obliged to meet statutory targets to reduce the impact  of our waste. By 2020, 50% of our household waste must be recycled, and the  amount of biological municipal waste going to landfill must be reduced to 35%  of that produced in 1995. Those targets will not only be challenging to us over  the next decade, there are obligatory intermediate milestones to be met in 2010  and 2013, which will be used to indicate that we are moving in the right  direction to meet the goals set for 2020.</p>
