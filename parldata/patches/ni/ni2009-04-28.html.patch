     <p class="B3BodyText">Individuals should listen carefully to Government advice,  which will be made available via the media and distributed on printed material.  People should consult the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website if they are  considering travelling to any affected areas. The current advice is against all  but essential travel to Mexico.  Information and advice for travellers will be available at all airports and  ports. Our enhanced monitoring and reporting will identify people with symptoms  that need to be investigated further.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">At this point in time, no confirmed cases of swine flu have  been found in Northern    Ireland. However, as the Chief Medical  Officer said, we should expect that there will be cases in due course. The  Government have prepared detailed plans and procedures already to ensure that  the country will be able to deal with cases of swine influenza. GPs across the  country have been notified and made aware of the symptoms and of what to do if  they suspect that a patient has pandemic flu. Hospitals are well prepared and  have specific plans to deal with a pandemic. We have stocks of antiviral drugs  that will be used to treat all those who become ill.</p>
     <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that Members will understand that, as a result of  these exceptional circumstances, I will be unable to respond to the motions  that have been scheduled for today. It is essential that I participate in a  number of important planned meetings on this serious public health threat.  However, I will be pleased to respond to any issues that Members may have on  those motions if they write to me about the matters in question.</p>
-    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for coming  back to the House today to keep us up to date with what is happening. I have no  doubt that the robust plans that the Minister outlined are in place. However, a  number of cases, albeit unconfirmed, has been identified on this island. What  will be the implications for us if those cases are confirmed?</p>

     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It has been reported from the Irish Republic  that none of those cases has reported positive. At the moment, there are no  confirmed instances of swine flu in Northern   Ireland or, as I understand the information from Dublin, in the Irish   Republic. Scotland has two confirmed cases, and England and Wales have no confirmed cases. I  have no doubt that there will be an increase in the number of people being  tested, because people who have concerns will contact their GPs. I also do not  doubt that tests will be run on a number of occasions. We will have to wait and  see how many positive tests arise and then decide what the consequences and  specific counter-measures will be with respect to the prescribing of antiviral  drugs.</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  How close are the experts to developing a vaccine for this type of flu? I  noticed that some tour operators were cancelling flights to Mexico. Is the  Minister&rsquo;s Department advising people not to travel to Mexico, and does that advice include travel to  the United States?</p>
     <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said in my statement, when  it comes to travel we follow the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,  which is advising people that they should travel to Mexico only if it is essential to  do so. I am not aware of any advice to people that they should not travel to  the United States.</p>
