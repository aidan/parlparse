The Council discussed a progress report on these issues under the Czech presidency, and took a decision on whether to refer legal questions concerning the court&#146;s structure to the European Court of Justice. The UK advocated referring these questions to the Court of Justice as soon as possible, and urged a rapid reply from the court. Doing so would allow us to make progress on creating a more efficient, affordable and responsive European patent system, which would help boost European innovation and competitiveness.</p>
