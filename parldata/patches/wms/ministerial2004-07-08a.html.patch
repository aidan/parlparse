  0n 29 April, I made a statement to the House, setting out how the Government proposed to handle authorities which had set excessive budgets for 2004&#150;05, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1019&#150;1021. I said that we were designating six local authorities and one fire authority, under the Local Government Finance Act 1992, with a view to capping them in a year. I also said that we were nominating a further four fire authorities and three police authorities with a view to taking action to restrain their budgets in 2005&#150;06&#151;either by setting a notional budget for this year against which future increases would be measured or by capping them in advance for next year.
