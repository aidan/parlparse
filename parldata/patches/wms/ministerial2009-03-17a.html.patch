Member states agreed conclusions on the single market as a source of competitiveness and engine of economic recovery and that protectionism should be avoided in all circumstances. Single market priorities included rapid implementation of the Services Directive and Small Business Act. I emphasised three key points: to protect the integrity of the single market; to continue to improve the functioning of the single market; and to identify priority areas for action through targeted reforms.</p>

In discussion, member states wanted short-term responses to the economic crisis to be consistent with long-term structural reforms. Industrial and economic support measures should be co-ordinated and respect single market rules. Member states agreed that priorities for competitiveness were SME access to finance, innovation and research, reducing administrative burdens and the energy internal market. I stressed the need for globally open markets, completing the Doha world trade round, reviewing the EU budget, active labour market policies and for low carbon investment. The key issues paper was formally adopted after some discussion on the text.</p>

I also said that the UK had reservations about the viability and value for money of vehicle scrappage schemes, but welcomed flexibility for member states to implement schemes as appropriate. In discussion the Commission raised concerns about the impact of the EU-Korea free trade agreement and in response I highlighted the wider benefits for the EU.

The Commission said that member states would be involved in a mid to long-term strategy for the Transatlantic Economic Council before the EU-US summit in June. Regarding the external dimension of EU competitiveness, the Commission emphasised the need for regulatory convergence and the benefits of multilateral agreements. On the Small Business Act package of EU measures to support small businesses, the Commission stressed the importance of implementation in view of the current economic crisis.</p>

- An asset survey of Service Family Accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales has been carried out as part of the Housing Prime Contract with Modern Housing Solutions. The survey was initially designed to compile an asset register (detailing for instance the make and model of boilers) but its scope was extended to collect &#147;standard for condition&#148; information and life cycle data for planning purposes. The results of the survey will provide improved management information to help us plan for the future and we will use the data from now on to inform reporting on the condition of SFA.</p>

-<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="90317m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09031764000046">The survey was visual and carried out by professionally qualified surveyors. Over 300 items of data were collected for each property and the improved information resulting has led to changes in the numbers of properties in each of the four standards for condition (standard 1 being the highest and standard 4 the lowest).</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="90317m0001.htm_para26"><a name="09031764000047">Previously reported figures reflected the results of a condition survey undertaken in 1996. The more detailed information collected in the present survey has changed the balance between standard 1 and 2 for condition. Overall, around 90 per cent. of SFA in England and Wales falls within these two standards but 32 per cent. are now assessed at standard 1 and 57 per cent. as being at standard 2, broadly reversing the previous position. Standard 2 properties are considered to be of a high standard, and both those and standard 1 properties have been assessed by the NAO as meeting or exceeding the Government&#146;s decent homes standard.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="90317m0001.htm_para27"><a name="09031764000048">The condition of each property is assessed against eight groupings of items (for example relating to the building fabric, or kitchen). Each grouping receives its own Standard for Condition and the lowest of these decides the overall standard of the property. Hence a property could be assessed as standard 2 (rather than 1) if seven of its groupings are at standard 1 but one is at standard 2.</p>
-
-<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="90317m0001.htm_para28"><a name="09031764000049">The number of houses falling into standard 4 has increased, though remains fewer than 450. Service families are no longer required to live in such properties, although some choose to do so. From 2012 no families will have to live in properties at either of the two lowest Standards for Condition. We remain committed to housing our personnel in high quality accommodation and this survey will help us achieve that objective.</p>

-the debate on the location of research facilities, the UK argued that decisions should be made on the basis of science&#151;where the facility would best contribute to excellent research, and that these infrastructures were important in promoting the mobility of researchers across Europe.

On the basis of my letter to the Czech presidency, the Commission has been tasked with bringing the issue to the VAT Committee quickly for a decision on the proposed VAT exemptions. The Committee&#146;s decision would need to be agreed by ECOFIN Ministers. The UK noted that whilst its initial view was that these research infrastructures did meet the criteria in the VAT directive to be exempt from VAT, an acceptable solution on this could only be found in the VAT legislation or its implementing guidelines. The UK also stressed that it could not agree to substantive VAT wording in the research infrastructure regulation itself. Ministers also discussed how to facilitate a decision on the location of the <i>European Spallation Source</i> (ESS). Member states with an interest in ESS would discuss this further with the view for a decision to be taken before summer 2009.</p>

The Council also took note of the progress made on negotiating a draft decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a <i>European Metrology Research Programme</i> (EMRP) article 169 initiative; first reading agreement with the European Parliament is expected to be reached within the current legislative term. The Commission also introduced a new communication setting out the value of <i>ICT facilities </i>for science. The presidency informed the Council that conclusions on the evaluation of R&amp;D activities including a recent evaluation of the sixth Framework Programme were being developed.
