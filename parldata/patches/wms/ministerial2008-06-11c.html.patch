 <p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="80611m0001.htm_para20"><a name="080611104000066">I learned on the evening of 10 June that at the request of Save the Children Fund (SCF) the paperwork for the clearance of its relief goods was handled by a clearing agent. No payment was received by this clearing agent for its service to SCF, and the full extent of the involvement of the clearing agent was to clear the documents for the shipment with the Burmese customs. While the airway bills for these supplies list the clearing agent as the consignee for the goods, the relief goods themselves were transferred directly from the aircraft to SCF&#146;s warehouse for onward distribution by SCF or other NGOs.</p>
