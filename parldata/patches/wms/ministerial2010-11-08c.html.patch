- I am today laying an amendment to The Mutilations (Permitted Procedures) (England) 2007 before Parliament, principally to extend the use of routine beak trimming of laying hens beyond 31 December 2010, while restricting the method used to the infra-red technique only. I know this is a significant issue for the House, as demonstrated by the large number of signatures for my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing West (Peter Bottomley) (EDM 260). I therefore want to set out the background behind these amending regulations and explain this Government's approach to working towards a future ban on beak trimming.<a href="<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101112/corrtext/101112c0001.htm#column_4MC">"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101112/corrtext/101112c0001.htm#column_4MC"</a><i>[Official Report, 12 November 2010, Vol. 518, c. 4MC.]</i></p>
