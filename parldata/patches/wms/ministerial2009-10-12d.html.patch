 <p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="91012m0001.htm_para10"><a name="0910122000053">As part of the EU's Lisbon Strategy for jobs and growth, the UK must present to the European Commission by 15 October 2009 its National Reform Programme (NRP) 2009, setting out UK progress on economic reform.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="91012m0001.htm_para11"><a name="0910122000054">The NRP responds to the recommendations the European Council agreed in March 2009 for the UK on fiscal sustainability and skills and employment, and the Council's points to watch for the UK on housing supply and R and D. The NRP 2009 also reports on UK progress in the areas of the business environment and climate change, energy policy, and sustainable development, which were re-emphasised by the European Council in March 2008 as priority areas over the 2008-10 cycle of the Lisbon Strategy. Reporting is in the context of the current downturn and medium-term reform measures, in line with the European economic recovery plan (EERP). The NRP 2009 does not make any new policy announcements: rather, it reports on the implementation of existing reforms, and looks forward to announced future policies.</p>
