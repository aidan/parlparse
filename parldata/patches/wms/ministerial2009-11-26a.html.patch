  The Education, Youth and Culture Council will be held on 26-27 November in Brussels. I will be representing the UK on 27 November when culture and audiovisual issues will be taken. Michael Russell MSP, Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution for Scotland, will also attend the Council.</p>
 
 <p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="91126m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09112624000059">The first item on the agenda concerns the Council conclusions on promoting a creative generation. These conclusions are part of a range of initiatives, suggested in 2007 by the Commission Communication on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world, which call for culture to be considered in broader aspects of the Council's work-in this instance education and digitisation. The UK has been broadly supportive of this approach and I intend to endorse the adoption of these conclusions.</p>
