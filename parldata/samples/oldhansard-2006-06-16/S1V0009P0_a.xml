<p>During the First Session of the Third Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the Kingdom of Great Britain the Twentieth, appointed to meet at Westminster, the Twenty-eight Day of August, and from thence continued, by several Prorogations, to the Fifteenth Day of December, in the Forty-seventh Year of the Reign of His Majesty King GEORGE the Third, Annoque Domini 1806.</p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-03-05">Thursday, March 5,1807.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>A considerable crowd assembled this evening, in the avenues leading to the gallery, in expectation of hearing the discussion and further examination of witnesses on the Westminster election petition; but owing to a ballot and a call of the house taking place, the doors Were not opened till half past six. On the admission of strangers into the gallery, we found the house engaged in a conversation relative to some irregularities that had been committed, or accident occasioned by persons forcibly entering through the body of the house, by which some members were likely to be injured. Mr. Yorke declared that in case of any repetition of suck a proceeding, he should think it his duty to enforce the standing order for the exclusion of strangers. Mr. Fellowes complained in strong terms of the crowd in the lobby, through which he had passed with much difficulty, and at the risk of having his arm broken. Mr. Barham observed, that he had seen a number of strangers force their way in spite of the resistance made by the officers of the house. The Speaker declared it to be the duty of the serjeant when he found that the avenues to the house were crowded with strangers, to provide proper persons to clear them, and to maintain order.&#x2014;Mr. White appeared at the bar, with the reduced list of the committee, ballotted to take into consideration the petition complaining of an undue return for the borough of Guildford. The following are the names .of the said committee: sir J. Callander, H. Everett, esq., H. Brownlow, esq., R. Dawson, esq., H. Peirse esq.,

T. Thistlethwaite, esq., W. Mellish, esq., lord Lovaine, W. Loftus, esq., A. Henderson, esq., lord Paget, W. J. Denison, esq., C. Vereker, esq., Nominees, hon. A. Wellesley, H. C. Combe, esq.&#x2014;On the motion of lord Howick, there were ordered to be laid before the house, accounts sheaving the time of service in his majesty's navy, of Thomas Weatherhead and William Drake; also, accounts shewing the pensions paid to W. Drake from the chest at Greenwich; the occasions on which the said pensions were granted, &amp;.&#x2014;On the motion of lord Howick, the house was ordered to be called over on Tuesday, when the noble lord declared, that unless a sufficient excuse should be made by the defaulters, he should move, that the course of proceeding adopted in 1793, of taking them into custody, should be enforced.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[ROMAN CATHOLIC'S ARMY AND NAVY SERVICE BILL.] Lord Howick rose</member> <membercontribution>in pursuance of the notice he had given some time ago, but which had been suspended in consequence of an alteration which it had been deemed advisable to make in the arrangement of the measure, to move for leave to bring in a bill for securing to all his majesty's liege subjects the privilege of serving in the army or navy, upon their taking an oath prescribed by act of parliament; and for leaving to them, as far as convenience would admit, the free exercise of their respective religions. He should have hoped that such a proposition was not likely to meet with much opposition. He should have imagined that to state it to be a desirable object for all goverments to unite every description of persons living under them in their own defence, was to state .a position
<image src="S1V0009P0I0017"/>
<col>3</col>
which would admit of no dispute. If any additional weight could be given to the strength of this position, it would be given by considering it as applicable to the present time. Was it prudent; was it politic, when we were contending with such a powerful enemy, to prevent a large portion of the population of the country from contributing to the common defence? As, notwithstanding his hopes, the affirmative of this question seemed to be held by some hon. members, he would trouble the house with an explanation of the grounds, on which the bill which he had the honour to propose, was founded. In doing this he should avoid as much as possible entering into the question of the general expediency of such laws as those which his proposed measure went to annul. It was not to be disputed that every government had a right to impose those due restraints which were necessary for its security; but that necessity Must be strong and apparent. This was a principle true and incontrovertible. Against what had the exclusions, which it was the object of his bill to remove, been in general directed? Not against religious Opinions themselves, but against religious opinions as supposed to be connected with some political principles of attachment, which were inconsistent with the existing order of things. On this ground and onthis ground alone, had the principle of exclusion been supported latter times. On this sole ground had it been supported by a writer, whose name it was impossible to mention without paying him that tribute of applause which was his due, he meant the late Dr. Paley, a man not more estimable for the excellence of his life than for the simplicity and logical precision of his works. If it were now necessary to state that the connexion which formerly existed between the religion and the politics of the catholics of the United Empire had ceased, and that therefore those restrictions which were applicable only to their politics, and not to their religion, were rendered unnecessary, he should feel no difficulty in making that statement, and in maintaining it by unanswerable arguments. If this were allowed, the proposition necessarily followed, that at the present season of difficulty and danger, when it was desirable to unite every heart and hand in the cause of the country, it was most unwise to exclude from that union so large a portion of the people as the catholics of Great Britain and Ireland, amounting in number to nearly a fourth of the whole population of the kingdom, and to pre-
<col>4</col>
vent them from sharing in the danger and glory of their countrymen. The fact was, that at that very moment a great proportion of our soldiers and sailors (particularly of the latter) were catholics, and was it fitting that parliament should not allow that by right which was already allowed by connivance? By the law which passed in the parliament of Ireland in 1793, the catholics were allowed to hold commissions in the army, and to enjoy those privileges in Ireland, which it was the object of the bill that he meant to propose to communicate generally to the catholics of this country. The bill would go to admit persons of every religious persuasion, to serve in the army and navy without any condition, but that of taking an oath particularized in the bill. Of course, if this indulgence was granted to catholics, it was unnecessary to state that there could be no objection to grant it to any other set of dissenters from the established church, unless some danger could be shewn which, he did not at present see. The provisions of the bill would therefore extend to persons of all religions persuasions. What had particularly drawn the attention of his majesty's government to this subject was, the, strange anomaly which existed in consequence of the act passed in Ireland in 1793, by which the roman catholics in that country were enabled to hold commissions in the army, and to attain to any rank except that of commander in chief of the forces, master general of the ordnance, or general on the staff. They might rise to be generals, but they were not permitted to be generals on the staff. The effect of this permission so granted to the catholics in Ireland, was a most striking incongruity; for if a catholic, who was by law qualified to serve in the army of Ireland, should be brought to this country by any circumstances which demanded the presence in this country of the regiment in which he served, he would be disqualified by law from remaining in the service, and would have only this alternative, either to continue in the service contrary to the law, and thus subject himself to the penalties and forfeitures consequent thereon, or to relinquish a profession in which he had risen to the rank which he might hold, either by the sacrifice of his fortune, or more probably by a succession of meritorious services, such as proved him qualified to defend the prosperity and assert the honour of the country. So absurd an inconvenience must be remedied. It was felt to be an inconvenience
<image src="S1V0009P0I0018"/>
<col>5</col>
when Great Britain and Ireland were separate nations, and had separate parliaments; and when the act of 1793 was proposed in the Irish parliament, it was declared that similar proposition should be made in two months in the parliament of Great Britain This was distinctly promised; lord Clare in the house of peers, and lord Bucking hamshire in the house of commons, distinctly stated, that it was the intention of his majesty's government, with all convenient dispatch, to propose a similar bill in the British parliament. The measure which he was about to submit to the judgemnt of the house was calculated to remove the inconvenience, and to reconcile the incongruity complained of, and at the same time to maintain the faith of the British government, by redeeming the pledge to which he had alluded. The beneficial effects of the Irish act were immediately felt, and had since been still more apparent, while not the slightest inconvenience had resulted from it. The shores of Egypt and the plains of Calabria were decisive proofs of the advantages which we had derived from that act, as they were also decisive proofs of the valour and patriotism of those distinguished heroes, who, by their gallant exertions, had deserved and obtained the eternal gratitude of their country. After such a lapse of time since the passing of the Irish act (the causes of which delay he would not then stay to examine, as he feared they could not be satisfactorily explained,) it was his intention to propose to grant to the catholics, and other dissenters of Great Britain, those privileges which, while they were an indulgence to them, would be a source of benefit to the country. As far as it was possible to collect the opinions of the house or the general feelings of the public on this subject, there seemed to be no objection to the measure, as a necessary consequence of the act of 1793, and as a redemption of the pledge given at that period. The only objection started appeared to be by those who thought that the proposed measure, by going farther than the act of 1793, established a new principle of concession which ought not to be acceded to. It would now therefore be necessary for him to state in What the two measures differed. The first difrence was, that the proposed measure went to permit persons of every religion to serve in the navy as well as in the army. When the Irish act was passed, it was distinctly stated, that in the bill to be submitted to the British parliament leave to serve, in the navy would be included, and the only rea-
<col>6</col>
son why it was not included in the Irish act was, that Ireland had no navy. If it were right to allow catholics to Serve in the army, Here could be no possible objection to allow them to serve in the other branch of our varlike establishment, so immediately connected with the prosperity of the country. The difference in the extent of the privileges granted by the two measures was this: the Irish act, while it admitted catholics to hold commissions in the army, did so under certain restrictions, by which, as he had before-mentioned, they were prevented from becoming commanders in chief of the forces, masters general of the ordnance, or generals on the staff. No such restriction was intended to be proposed in the present instance, because it was not believed that such a restriction was founded on any good principles; for if any danger attended the admission of catholics into the army, it was the duty of the legislature not to restrain, but wholly to exclude them. The same principle which induced his majesty's ministers to propose the adoption of a similar law for the two countries induced them to propose the abolition of a similar law for the two countries, induced them to propose the abolition of restrictions &#x2014;consistency; for there could be nothing more incongruous than the consequences of these restriction, which might be attended with considerable inconvenience to the service. A catholic might, by the Irish act, rise through the regular gradations, and become a field officer: he might become a major, a lieutenant-colonel, a colonel; in this last capacity, he might have the command of a corps equal in number to that frequently under the orders of officers of superior rank; he might shew himself eminently qualified for a situation of greater trust; he might distinguish himself to such a degree as to be called upon by the voice of the army and the people to fill that situation; but it would be impossible to create him a major-general! This was a great discouragement to the catholic officer; it was a greater disadvantage to the country, which, by such a restriction, had lost- the extended services of many a brave and skilful man. Nor did the restrictions form any security against danger, if danger could be supposed to exist. And after all, it must be considered, that the proposed measure only enabled his majesty to appoint such persons to situations of high importance. Their appointment must depend upon the executive government who of course would avoid any dangerous or im-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0019"/>
<col>7</col>
proper use of their authority. In addition to the advantage of enabling the country to avail itself of the whole extent of its population, without any of those restrictions which operated merely to keep up a spirit of discontent, and to damp that ardour which might otherwise be so successfully directed to the public service, the proposed Measure, in addition to these things, provided for all who should enter his majesty's service the free and unrestrained exercise of their religion, as far as it did not interfere with their military duties. Perhaps it would be said that this might be accomplished in another way, by giving directions to that effect; but he was apprehensive that this could only be partially done; besides, the insecurity and instability of such a mode of proceeding would deter catholics entering into the army, and would furnish to those who might be desirous of preventing them, sufficient means of persuasion. Let them have full security in the shape of a clause in an act of parliament: let them have the sanction of the legislature and all doubt would be removed. if there was any possible utility in this provision, when it was considered that it could be attended with no possible inconvenience or danger, he trusted that it would meet with no objection. He had thus stated briefly the objects of the proposed bill. Briefly, because he was not aware that in this stage the measure would occasion much debate. He could, indeed, hardly persuade himself that any serious objection to it could exist in the minds of the house or of the public; with regard to the latter part of it, the whole extent of the provision was, to prevent dissenters from being interrupted in the exercise of their own religion, and compelled to adopt a religion, irreconcilable to their faith. This was the whole extent; it held out no encouragement to them; it established no institution for their support or increase. The abolition of restrictions in point of rank would place before the sons of the gentry of Ireland, those fair objects of ambition, it would open to them that career of glory, the pursuit of which was synonimous with the advancement of the best interests of the empire. On the commonalty of Ireland the measure must have a powerful effect, by affording a salutary check to the increasing superabundant population of that country, as it would induce numbers to enter into the service of his majesty; even of those who by their own discontents, and by the artifices of others, had so lately been urged into
<col>8</col>
insurrection and rebellion.&#x2014;The noble, lord concluded with moving, " That, leave be given to bring in a bill for enabling his, majesty to avail himself of the services of all his liege subjects in his naval and military forces, in the manner therein mentioned."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval </member>, <membercontribution>although he would not at present enter into any debate on the proposed bill, yet, as the principle of it was one which he felt it his bounden duty to oppose, he thought it right, even in the first instance, to apprise the noble lord of the nature of his objections, and to call the serious attention of the house, and of the public, to one of the most important and most dangerous measures that had ever been submitted to the judgment of the legislature. It was not so much to the individual measure which he objected, but to the system of which it formed a part, which was growing day after day, and threatening to expand into the most alarming magnitude. If it was desirable to preserve any thing of our ancient and venerable establishments it could only be effected by making a stand against every fresh attempt at innovation. To what did the proposed measure tend? With any degree of consistency its supporters could not stop short of abolishing all the tests which the wisdom of our ancestors had thought it necessary to interpose in defence of our religious establishment. The proposed measure was a partial repeal of the test act, founded on arguments which went to the repeal of that act. It was his firm conviction, that if the legislature wished to preserve Ireland to this country, if they wished to keep the two islands united, they would maintain the protestant interest in Ireland, under which toleration was permitted, and not run the risk of sacrificing that interest to another, which, when in power, had not permitted toleration, and which, if it regained power, might revert to its former practice, as it declared that its principles were Unchangeable. It was the more necessary to pause on this subject, as it had been thought wise and liberal to provide the means of support for a priesthood to instruct three millions of people in the catholic religion, and thus perpetually to combat the progress of protestantism. From the arguments that were advanced at the present day, a man might almost be led to suppose that one religion was considered as good as the other, and that the reformation was deemed only a convenient and political measure. He was far from ascribing indifference on this point to the noble lord, who, he was sure, gave the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0020"/>
<col>9</col>
preference where it was justly due; but the noble lord had said, that it approached to a spirit of persecution for parliament to hesitate in appropriating the funds of the country to the support of those who preached a doctrine subversive of the religion of the country. He might be wrong; it might be policy so to dispose of the national revenue: it might be called for by the true and enlightened spirit of Christian toleration. He certainly did not think it was. He had as great a regard for true toleration as any man. He would never restrain the free exercise of religious worship in any individual; for he could not conceive that one man could commit a greater crime against another than by such an interference. But however strongly he might feel this sentiment, the application of it to any particular measure was a very different consideration. The noble lord proposed to open the army and navy to persons of all religions, and he founded this proposition on the Irish act of 1793, and on the incongruity which this act produced. To this he could not bring himself to consent, without a much stronger case than that which was made out by the noble lord. If the grievances which had been stated by the noble lord ever existed in possibility, they had at least never been experienced in practice. There was not an instance of a single individual having been injured or prosecuted in consequence of them. Besides these grievances, if there were any, had existed not only since the union of Great Britain and Ireland, but since the union of England and Scotland; for there was no difference between the inconvenience sustained by the catholic of Ireland, on entering his majesty's service, and the inconvenience sustained by the presbyterian of Scotland or doing the same. The presbyterian of Scotland was sacrificed as much as the catholic of Ireland; but had there been any disposition evinced on the part of the presbyterian of Scotland to withhold his services? But setting this aside, he denied the proposition of the noble lord in point of law; he denied that a catholic, who obtained a commission in Ireland, was liable to any penalties, called over to exercise his military duties in Great Britain. If this was not so, we should have an act which compelled a man to perform a certain duty, and which yet did not protect him in the execution of that duty which it compelled him to perform; such an act was not to be found in the code of British and Irish jurisprudence. Did not the united parliament, which must be sup-
<col>10</col>
posed to be as well acquainted with the laws of Ireland as with the laws of Great Britain, pass every year a mutiny bill, which enabled the king to require the services of every man in his army in any part of his dominions to which he might think proper to summon him; and was it to be supposed that be was insecure in doing that, the refusal to do which would subject him to be shot? And after all, if any inconveniences actually did occur, the annual indemnity act would completely cover the case. This was, therefore, not a substantive grievance, and to ground the proposed measure on it was a mere pretence. There were ulterior causes for its being brought forward. What were they? It was proposed to do away the restrictions by which catholics were prevented from holding superior commissions in the army, and this on arguments which would affect equally every situation in the country, civil as well as military. It certainly was a great discouragement in any profession that the professors could not arrive at the highest distinctions. In his own profession it must be great discouragement to a catholic lawyer, to know that he could not be made a judge or a chancellor. (hear !) He saw that some of the gentlemen opposite were prepared to go the utmost extent, and to say, that in every profession and every employment there onght to be no distinction between the catholic and the protestant. Did those gentlemen perceive that their reasoning extended even to the succession to the crown? He had thrown out these observations to provoke this expression of sentiment from the gentlemen opposite, and to shew that they thought the road to the highest honours in the state should be opened to persons of every description, without any disqualification whatever. Taking it on this ground, the question would become narrowed; it would not be, whether you would allow catholic officers superior rank, but whether you would allow those arguments to be well founded by which that proposition was maintained, whether you would tranquillize Ireland by feeding its insatiable appetite with the hope of getting all that it demanded. If this were to be the policy of this country, there was but one line of wisdom to be pursued:&#x2014;to do every thing; to transfer the church of Ireland to the catholics; for unless that were done, little progress would be made in tranquillizing Ireland. Partially to redress grievances, would only have the effect of making those that remained more severely felt, or 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0021"/>
<col>11</col>
at least more loudly complained of. Why, then, the question was simply this, whether the legislature would give up the protestant ascendancy in, Ireland, or whether they would make a stand, and say, "We have already done every thing that toleration requires and that the catholics have a right to demand?" Undoubtedly, such a declaration would be the dictate of sound policy and discretion. In one of his. statements the noble lord had palpably contradicted himself; for, in the first place, he endeavoured to make the house believe, that the army and navy were crowded with catholics, and then he recommended that they should have a free admission. With respect to the proposition for the free exercise of religion, it was unnecessary; for if it were thought proper, his majesty might introduce such a regulation in the articles of war. But if it were to be made the subject of a legislative. provision, the utmost confusion must ensue. One soldier would go to a methodist's chapel, another to a presbyterian conventicle, a third to a roman catholic church; in short to every place of worship but a protestant one; for it was curious enough, that there was to be no legislative provision for the protestants to go to the church of England. But, if all this confusion would take place in the army, what must happen in the navy? The noble lord had declared that he apprehended no inconvenience from this unprecedented toleration in the navy. No inconvenience! Suppose the captain and crew of a man of war were roman catholics, they must have a roman catholic clergyman&#x2014;(A cry of no! no!)&#x2014;Why, as a captain of a man of war had a right to appoint his chaplain, if he were a roman catholic, he would scarcely appoint a protestant clergyman. Perhaps it was intended that this should be determined by the admiralty board. But it would be difficult for that board accurately to ascertain the proportion in a crew between the catholics and the protestants. This too he would maintain, that, in case of any invasion of Ireland by a French force, the commander of which should issue a proclamation in support of the roman catholic religion, that invasion would not be so vigourously repelled by a roman catholic captain and crew, as by a protestant captain and crew. These were considerations which ought to excite the jealousy and apprehension of the house and of the country; but he was not so anxious to call their attention to the particular measure now proposed as to the principle of innovation which was
<col>12</col>
gradually increasing; and was much more formidable, thus stealing on by degrees, than if it were, fairly exposed in all the magnitude to which it seemed intended that it should arrive. In that case, the notice of parliament would be strongly attracted to the subject; it Would take it up in an extensive point of view; it would determine upon it deliberately, and he trusted wisely. The consequences of a storm he should not be apprehensive about; but these gradual approaches were dangerous, because each by itself was not deemed worthy of notice. It should be considered, however, that even if they were little in themselves, their consequences were not so. For his own part, he. was satisfied that if parliament allowed their accumulation, it would ultimately have that extorted from its weakness, which its wisdom would be desirous to withhold.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Temple</member> <membercontribution>said, that he considered it a misfortune to have heard the speech that had been delivered by the hon. and learned gent. who had just sat down: he could not help saying, that it appeared to him to savour much of opinions long since obsolete, and to breathe a kind of spirit fitter for the darker ages, than for the liberal and enlightened times in which we at present lived. Was it necessary at this time of day to go into formal proof of the impolicy, the madness of intolerance? Was it necessary now to prove, that it ever defeated its own end, and contributed to establish what it had conspired to overthrow? He hoped that it was not, and yet the speech of the hon. and learned gent. Would lead the house to suppose, that that gentleman himself entertained doubts of a truth, he might say, universally assented to, and confirmed by the successive experience of ages. He would ask the hon. and learned gent. if it were wise, just or politic, to exclude the brave fellows who made up a considerable portion of our navy and army, from the advantages and the glory of the service, when they shared in all its dangers? It was not usual in so early a stage of a bill to go into all its merits, and he should not now do so; he could not however abstain from entering his solemn protest against the revival of all those intolerant bigotries, which had in all times been productive of the most mischievous effects. The hon. and learned gent. had insinuated gloomy predictions in case of the enemy affecting a landing in Ireland. Upon what were these .apprehensions founded, but the evils which the proposed bill purposed to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0022"/>
<col>13</col>
remove; by removing the evil, the discontent so much dreaded by the learned gent would no longer exist. It had been said too, that if so much was given to the catholics; they would requite all; they would not stop here, nor be satisfied till the establishes church of Ireland was a roman catholic one. But to this argument he considered it a sufficient answer to say, that all that was asked in the present instance was a boon of a limited extent; and that was only in case of more being asked, or being attempted to be granted, that the hon. and learned gent's, argument would have its effect. In short, the whole question reduced itself to this, whether the exact boon now asked, was such as, if granted, could render the catholics, either in this country or Ireland, the objects of jealousy or distrust? In vain would it be to expect allegiance from those, who were, at the same time, told, that they were unfit to enjoy the benefits of that allegiance; or to look for attachment from those, who were not to receive any support from the government of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr Yorke</member> <membercontribution>approved of the principle of the bill proposed, as applied to the roman catholics of England; but it was a distinct question how far it should apply to Ireland. He did not think it fair that the roman catholics in Ireland should have any advantages over those in any other parts of the empire. His hon. and learned friend's speech did not appear to him to have deserved the severe animadversion to which it had been subjected by the noble lord who had spoken last. The noble lord had objected to that speech as more worthy of the darker ages. No one who knew the great talents and enlightened mind of ,his hon. and learned friend could suppose that any speech of his could deserve such a description. The sentiments his hon. and learned friend had uttered, were those of 1688, and he wished to know if the noble lord thought the times that placed the house of Hanover on the throne of these realms were the darker ages. He agreed entirely with his hon. and learned friend as to the necessity of putting at length some limits to those daily innovations on the church of England establishment. He did not wish to revive unpleasant remembrances, but, at the same time, as it was impossible to forget the spirit of insurrection which prevailed amongst the Irish catholics in the year 1798, so it must not be wondered at, if feelings of considerable jealousy were excited on the present occa-
<col>14</col>
sion. As to the roman catholic of this country, they had undergone the purgation of centuries, and must be considered as good am loyal subjects. He saw, no necessity for introducing the present bill, and particularly that clause which went to authorise to all persons in the army and navy, not of ail communion of the church of England, the free exercise of their religious worship; for he had never heard any practical difficulty stated, or any real ground of complaint respecting catholic officers and men being prohibited from attending divine worship in their own way; and he had personally known some catholic officers in the army, who had made no difficulty of going with their division to church. When the Reformation first took place the catholics made no objection to attend the worship, but only the sacraments of the church of England; for although the protestant church expunges and rejected what it considered as erroneous, still it retained a part of the formularies made use of in the church of Rome; he therefore saw no serious grievance existing which required to be remedied by an act of parliament; and he really thought it was much better policy not to attempt to remedy the grievance in this way, which ought not to be resorted to without a cause of strong necessity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Montague</member> <membercontribution>declared, that he considered whatever related to the protestant religion, as distinguished from the roman catholic, to be of serious importance to this country, and that the preservation of the protestant establishment was essentially requisite to maintain the peace both of this country and Ireland. Upon the subject of religion, the house had two Principles to look to; the first was that of toleration, without which nothing could go on well in a country; and next to this was the security of the establishment. He was afraid, from the arguments which had been adduced by the noble lord who had introduced this measure, that similar innovations would be pressed upon the house, and would at last proceed so far as to render it impossible for parliament, to maintain the tests which experience had proved to be so useful. The same sort of arguments would go to admit all dissenters into all offices and places of public appointment, even those which a large majority of that house, formerly, and which the nation at large had considered as dangerous to the religious establishment of the country. The constitution of this country and a church establishment were so interwoven with each 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0023"/>
<col>15</col>
other, that the one. could not be affected without endangering the other. He, therefore, for one, would consent to toleration so far only as it did not tend to endanger the establishment, and he was entirely of opinion with his hon. and learned friend near him, that they had already gone far enough, and that any further innovation would be unnecessary; for what was the argument of the noble lord? It was an argument founded upon the anomaly between the two religions. This argument proved too much, for if this bill was proposed to remedy this anomaly, then would the innovation grow greater and greater every day, until the anomaly was destroyed by putting the two religions precisely on the same footing; by repealing the bill of rights, and the test act. As to the terms 'darker ages,' he, for his part, did not think that the persons who prefered the protestant religion had darker understandings than those who thought all religions equal. As to the operation of the bill proposed, his learned friend was about to put the case of a ship commanded by a roman catholic captain, but as he was diverted from it. he should beg leave to put it for him:&#x2014;The captain is a catholic; his crew partly roman catholics. Well; the captain brings-a catholic priest on board, may, not one priest (for he is not to be limited), but a dozen of them, perhaps; and what is the consequence? The priests disseminate their popish doctrines through the ship: some are converted, some not; disunion is thus bred among the seamen; and, instead of preparing to beat the common enemy they turn against one another, and fall to controversial preaching&#x2014;(loud laughter) It was not a thing to laugh at: he would assure the gentlemen that it required more serious consideration. He could not help alluding to the levity of certain gentlemen opposite. He was the more surprised to see his noble friend among them (lord Howick) but he was sure the noble lord would be far from intending him any personal incivility. But, as to the popularity of the measure itself, he could not help warning ministers of urging upon the people an innovation of such popular odium. He reminded ministers of the riots of 1780, and cautioned them to beware of similar consequence. The noble lord, little as he seemed to feel this warning, would not be quite so indifferent if his house were burned to the ground (a laugh). Why! was he to be told that it rage of controversy was to be confined to doctors of divinity (a laugh)? Were there
<col>16</col>
not to be found as furious polemics in the mob, as among these who had graduated? As to any obstruction given to the roman catholics in the exercise of their religion, he did not believe it. He asked of gentlemen on the other side, if they knew a single instance of such obstruction? [Here Sir John Newport distinctly answered in the affirmative]; It might be so; but he confessed he had his doubts. He must again advert to the attempts which he perceived were made-to put him down. But gentlemen little knew him if they expected to succeed in such attempts. He would raise his voice and speak the sentiments of an honest and independent member of parliament. He had now said what he had to say upon this question, and gentlemen had defeated their own purpose; for if they had not so interrupted him, he should have sat down much sooner.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fremantle</member> <membercontribution>declared, that in his view of the subject, the measure now proposed did not bear upon the constitution of the country. There was no clause in this bill that went to provide for the establishment of the catholic clergy, either in the army or navy. It did not militate either against the bill of rights or the act of settlement, and he should feel sorry if such an impression as this were made upon the public mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr.T. W. Plummer</member> <membercontribution>said, this measure appeared to him to be one which called for the serious attention of the house. The country had been deprived for a long time of the services of a large body of people, and now that a fair opportunity offered for granting the present boon, he trusted the time was come, when no honest catholic would be deprived of the opportunity of serving his country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Corry</member> <membercontribution>lamented, that upon the introduction of this measure, an alarm should have been raised, as if it would draw the protestant establishments of England and Ireland into danger. He hoped gentlemen would come to the consideration of this question without prejudice. It was a question of importance, and its tendency was to prevent the natives of Ireland from being banished from the ranks of military fame and glory at home, and being drawn into the service of foreign countries. This measure went to secure their services at home, and ought therefore to be examined upon its own merits. The principles of the revolution ought always to beheld in the greatest veneration; but when the house looked to the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0024"/>
<col>17</col>
objects of that revolution, there would be found to be two principal objects in view, namely, the religious and civil liberties Of the country. With respect to the latter, he trusted they would never be attended to by a British parliament, and that that house would look with incessant jealousy to any measure that tended to overthrow the liberties of the country; but, with respect to the other object, the protestant religion, it should be remembered, that the question was then, whether a popish house should sit upon the throne? But would any man pretend, that there was a similar danger now? or that the popish religion was ever likely to gain such an establishment in parliament, as to endanger the protestant religion? He was sure that such danger was remote indeed; and that in the present measure, no scintilla of danger of this sort was likely to arise; and he also trusted, that the house would not partake of that alarm, which the hon. and learned gent. had endeavoured to create.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. I. H. Browne</member> <membercontribution>thought certainly that gentlemen should not be too hasty to take an alarm, till they saw the bill. But with regard to the catholic religion, he considered its spirit to be as hostile to the liberties of this country, as any arbitrary power could be. He trusted that there was no dread of any foreign conqueror; but should a succesful and formidable usurper, who has cemented tyranny wherever he has gone, penetrate to Ireland, and avail himself of the Pope's bull, for the re-establishment of the catholic religion in that country, he could not think, that additional indulgences would ensure the loyalty of that body. He was far from thinking that concession after concession would conciliate the affections, or ensure the obedience of the Irish catholics. He foresaw considerable danger from these concessions, as they tended to prepossess the minds of the catholics with expectations of still farther concessions. He was averse to innovations, unless an existing evil could be proved, which could not be remedied but by law; but in the present instance, he was not aware that any such practical inconvenience existed. Unless the house was prepared to go the length of saying, that every office in the united kingdom was to be open to persons of all religions, he could see no good argument for advancing catholics to the highest appointments in the army. He should, however, have no objection to put all the roman catholics in the united kingdom upon the same footing as the Irish
<col>18</col>
catholics now were. The Irish roman Catholics had at present every thing which they could reasonably wish for: their property was secure; provision was made for the education of their priests; the military and legal professions were opened to them; in short, they had every thing-they could wish for, excepting political power. Ought they; then, to be insensible of the blessings they enjoyed, or ungrateful for the benefits they possess under the best of sovereigns, merely because they did not possess political power? It had been the wisdom of our ancestors to restrain the executive power from conferring the highest offices upon roman catholics,.and we ought to revere their memories, and. also to do justice to posterity, by maintaining the fences which our anoestors had erected.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>in reply, said, he had hoped that his motion for introducing the bill would have passed without any discussion. He wished this question to be treated on its own merits. He did not consider it as standing upon the ground, of toleration; but that it rested on the footing, that, in consequence of what had formerly passed in the Irish parliament, it was necessary ,to make the laws in the two countries consistent with themselves, and not to suffer the catholics to be in that anomalous situation in which no people were ever placed before. He saw no reason for that alarm which some hon. gentlemen had endeavoured to create; for, as to this measure, it could,be attended no danger to the religion or establishment of the country. He could not concur opinion with the hon. and learned gent, that if a person in the army was called out in obedience to the order of his superior, and at the, peril of his that therefore he could not incur any penalty under possible circumstances;. he could not subscribe to the hon. and learned gent's exposition of the law, particularly on the subject of compulsory service, and more especially when he recollected the opinion which that hon. and learned gent. had formerly given on the subject of the volunteers. The Irish act of Parliament could only regulate the army of Ireland; and if an Irish regiment removed to England, it was then upon the English establishment, to which the acts of the Irish parliament could not extend, and consequently its officers were subject to all the penalties which a British legislature had enacted. But, from the moment of the union taking place between the two countries, and when there was no longer an Irish army, but the army of the United Kingdom,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0025"/>
<col>19</col>
and to which the acts of the united parliament can alone extend, he doubted whether the Irish catholic could receive any commission in the army. He acknowledged, that, <i>de fucto</i>, the catholics did hold commissions, but it was contrary to existing laws; and although no advantage bad been taken of this breach of the law, he would ask, whether it was fair to place the catholics in such a situation, and to pass that over by connivance, which the law forbad, instead of giving it a legal sanction? The hon. and learned gent. had professed himself a friend to the principle of toleration; but toleration, to be complete, must be free from any exclusion whatever, and the only true principle of exclusion, on account of religious opinions, was, when these opinions were connected with political principles hostile to the state; but when this ceased to exist, he would contend that then all ,disqualifications ought to cease. The hon. gent. who spoke last had contended, that the catholics were only excluded from political power, but was not that an important object? For, how could civil rights be secured to any considerable degree? without the possession of political power? And must not such persons as were disqualified from the acquisition of political power, feel discontented? And ought-such exclusions to be considered as necessary, unless when danger would arise from conferring them? But in granting the present boon, no such danger would arise. The Irish parliament had already sanctioned the Measure, and formed the precedent. It was-true, that Irish catholics might at present enter as soldiers and sailors;but a clause in this bill was provided to grant them security for the free exercise of their religion, and it would afford the catholic officers a greater facility of recruiting for the army and navy. When his hon. friend (Mr. Mountague) had carried,his alarm so far as to doubt whether this bill would not change the navy into a religious disputing club, and that when all hands where piped, the ship would become a scene of religious controversy; he must say that he could not treat such an argument with his accustomed gravity; but it was reserved for this night's debate to assert that the way to excite religious debate was to soften down differences. His hon. friend had reminded the house of the year 1780, and the fires which were then lighted up. He well remembered that disgraceful scene: but what was the cause? Was it in consequence of the catholics having had new privileges granted them, that they
<col>20</col>
stirred up division? Was it not rather, on the contrary, that a certain person (some what in the spirit which had discovered itself that night) had made use of inflammatory language, which had produced the fatal effect? When his hon. friend spoke of the danger to which this house might be exposed, he had only to request of his hon. friend not to promote that danger, by unnecessary alarms: for himself he entertained no such apprehensions. After the extinction of the riots in 1780, when liberty was granted to the catholics, and when the question of similar concessions with the present was agitated in that house, no such consequences ensued; nor would they, at the present, unless the spirit of bigotry should again excite false alarms of dangers, without reality, so as to excite an attack upon men's lives and properties. He declared no man was a more sincere friend to the protestant church of England than himself; but he did not think that the best way of supporting it was by pains, penalties, and exclusions; but on the contrary, by moderation and candour. The present he considered to be a beneficial measure, and that not only to the catholics but to the country at large,.and on the principle of general advantage; nor did he consider that there was any thing diigraceful in making concessions, when occasion required. He only wished this measure might undergo a fair examination, being convinced that the result of free discussion always was, that the cause of truth would flourish and prevail.&#x2014;The noble Lord then moved for leave to bring in the bill as stated in the motion; which was agreed to without a division. The bill was read a first time and ordered to be read a second time this day se'nnight.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY &#x2014;PRUSSIAN SUBSIDY.]&#x2014;Mr. Hobhouse</member> <membercontribution>brought up the Report of the Committee of supply. On the resolution for granting 80,000l, to make good a like sum granted to the King of Prussia,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bankes </member>, <membercontribution>regarding this grant as the first instalment a subsidy to Prussia, and regarding subsidies, though they might be wise in some circumstances, as very generally unwise, felt, himself bound,to state his sentiment at some length. He would recal the attention of the house to the subsidies granted since the commencement of the late war, every one of which it was thought hard to refuse at the time, but everyone of which had altogether failed of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0026"/>
<col>21</col>
producing the benefits expected from it. He first instanced the subsidy to the King of Sardinia, agreed upon in 1793, the amount of which was to be 200,000l. a year during the war. But the King of Sardinia was obliged to make a separate peace in less than 3 years. In the same year a treaty of subsidy was entered into with Hesse Cassel, and that power was obliged to make a separate peace in 2 years. In 1796, another treaty was made with no better result. The electoral troops of Hanover, the mar-grave of Baden, and the landgrave of Hesse Darmstadt, subsidised at the same time, all made peace in the same year. In 1793, a subsidy was granted to Russia, guaranteed by the United States. The sum was 50,000l. a month during the war, and 300,000l. in advance, but Russia made a separate peace in 1795. A larger subsidy was granted to Austria in 1795. There was a loan to that power of 4,600,000l. in 1796, and a further loan of 1,603,000l. in 1797. But Austria also was compelled, by distress, to make a precipate peace shortly after. A new loan of 2,000,000l. was advanced in 1800, and, shortly after, the battle of Marengo extinguished all hopes of benefit from the co-operation of Austria. In 1798, a treaty of subsidy was concluded with Russia. The sum to be supplied monthly was 50,000l with an advance of 300,000l. But the policies of the court of Russia changed suddenly, and that power became our active enemy. In 1800, the electors, of Bavaria and Mentz, and other powers, were also subsidised with as little effect. Since the renewal of the war on the continent in 1805, another treaty had existed, and it was only last night that sums had been voted to pay some arrears accrued under that treaty. But that treaty had had no better effect than the former. The fatal battle of Austerlitz compelled that power to make what terms she could, and now we had to make good to Sweden and to Russia the arrears of tint unfortunate subsidiary alliance. The present grant seemed to be the commencement of a new system of subsidy. He should not be disposed to cavil at this sum, if it were not to lead to many larger grants. (lord Howick said across the table, no; there is no treaty of subsidy.) The hon. gent. in continuation, said, if there was no provision for subsidy in the treaty with Prussia, he had trespassed too long upon the house. He had addressed the house only on the idea that a larger subsidy was in contemplation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H.Petty</member> <membercontribution>sated, that this advance
<col>22</col>
was made by lord Hutchinson for the particular exigencies of the army and the fortresses in Silesia. He conceived the cause of the misunderstanding, that this advance was the commencement of a subsidy, arose from its having been mentioned in the message from his majesty communicating the intelligence of the treaty of peace with the king of Prussia. But there was nothing of subsidy in the treaty, the advance had been made in consequence of a discretionary power given to lord Hutchinson, whose discretion could not be doubted in case any particular emergency required such a grant or any particular services could be effected by it. This advance had had great effect in preventing the progress of the enemy in the quarter in which it had been applied. He agreed with the hon. gent. that in making future treaties of subsidy, we ought to be regulated by past experience, and that our advantages ought to be regulated by the benefits, which according to past experience, we might reasonably hope to receive.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bankes </member>, <membercontribution>under the explanation that had been given, had no objection to make good the advance that had been made by lord Hutchinson. He was pleased with the assurance given by the noble lord, that in future treaties of subsidy past experience would be made the guide, and that vast sums would not be advanced without any certain benefit.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>said, that lord Hutchinson had a discretionary power to make advances in case of any pressing emergency, and he was sure every person would agree that such a discretion could not be placed in better hands. There was no treaty of subsidy But he would not have the house go away with the idea that government was precluded from granting a subsidy, if circumstances should render it desirable. He agreed that many of the former subsidies were must unwise in principle, and most unproductive in even. But every case depended upon its own circumstances. A principle of caution ought always to be applied, to prevent the advances from being made unnecessarily, or incautiously, so as to hazard a risk, that no benefit would be derived. He dissapproved of all subsidies which would hold out English money to induce foreign powers to enter into war without any objects of their own. But when they were engaged, or ready to engage, for common interests, he thought it would be very wrong not to hold ourselves at liberty to second and support them. He allowed that past experience ought to be

<p><member>[MR. PAULL'S PETITION RESPECTING THE WESTMINSTER ELECTION.]. Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for taking into further consideration the Petition of James Paull, Esq., complaining of undue tampering with the witnesses summoned to give evidence before the committee, about to be appointed to try the merits of the late Election for Westminster. [See in vol. S, the proceedings of the 26th of February and the 2d of March.]</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that by the forms of the house, a witness could not stay in the house during the examination of the witnesses. He had summoned Mr. Paull as a witness, but he begged to state that he had no objection to his remaining at the bar the whole time of the proccedings&#x2014;The counsel for the petitioner were then called in, and </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plumer</member> <membercontribution>addressed the house as follows:&#x2014;"Mr. Speaker; I now proceed to discharge the duty which, under the indulgence of the house, I have been permitted to reserve for this day, in stating the petition of Mr. Paull and the evidence in support of it, and, sir, with every grateful acknowledgments to the house for the indulgence I have experienced, I must, at the same time, state to the house the inability I am under to profit entirely by it. The very voluminous body of evidence and the inability of access to it till a very late period, have prevented my adverting to many of the circumstances which have been stated. I shall, therefore, content myself with addressing only general observations, except on particular parts of the testimony which we are able to collect as most important on the subject: and, in discharging this duty, I shall, on every consideration, most rigidly abstain from every topic which does not directly belong to the duty imposed upon me. I shall endeavour to discharge that duty,as briefly as I am able, from every consideration of duty and of respect to the house, as well as other considerations with which it is, unnecessary for me to trouble you.&#x2014;Sir, I shall in the first place, state what are the allegations contained in the petition, and then briefly remind you of the evidence you have heard in support of it; and, on this subject, I am persuaded, whatever judgment the house may finally think proper to pronounce with respect to this petition, I hope I am not too sanguine in expecting, that whatever difference of opinion
<col>24</col>
may prevail on other parts of the subject, yet on one there will be no difference of opinion; namely, the sincerity of the individual who has presented this petition to the house&#x2014;the sincere and honest belief of the truth of its contents. I do not expect any credit to be given from any Personal consideration either to any thing I state, or any thing stated, by the individual for whom I have the honor to appear, but I am persuaded every gentleman will see, that a petition of this nature could not have been addressed to the house in common prudence, if there had not been a sincere and honest belief of the truth of its contents; because, it could not possibly answer any purpose of benefit to the individual who has exhibited it, prematurely to bring under the consideration of this house the merits of that case by which he will be able to support a petition hereafter, to disclose all that he had, or a part of what he had to bring forward upon another occasion, with the probability, .not of having it more advantageously discussed, but he must be fully aware that the wisdom and judgment of this house would infallibly discover it to be so, and that the consequences could. be only ruin and disgrace to him and to his cause; that the contest must be pursued here with every disadvantage to himself, where his opponent, being of necessity a member of the house, has every opportunity given him to discuss and to question throughout the whole of the proceedings, while he, the other litigant party, is not permitted to stand in the same situation; that every possible advantage, therefore, would be derived front these circumstances on the one side, and every disadvantage on the other, by prematurely bringing this under consideration was quite obvious. Why, then, was this done? For what purpose was the petition presented? For what purpose was this inquiry brought under the consideration of the house in this novel shape? Why was it done? Surely, no one will be at a loss to recollect why it was done, when they recollect what was the situation of the petitioner&#x2014;under what circumstances he stood. This petition was presented after an application had been made with success, to postpone the hearing of the petition which he had previously presented, and for which, he was making preparation, by having served various witnesses with the highest authority to compel their attendance and to ensure their attendance. After he was thus engaged in preparations to bring forward his cause, expecting it to have been heard on the 24th of feb., he had
<image src="S1V0009P0I0028"/>
<col>25</col>
intelligence given him, upon which he thought he might securely rely, that practices had been made use of by various persons whose names I will presently state&#x2014;that practices prevailed to a very considerable extent, which threatened the loss of several of his witnesses, and which were addressed, from day to day, with the hope of endeavouring to persuade others to deprive him of that testimony, at least of a part of it, which was afterwards to support his cause.&#x2014;Now, sir, laying aside all personal considerations end considering this petitioner as merely in the character of a party having presented a petition to the house, which was in progress to being heard&#x2014;which stood for hearing&#x2014;which he had a right to prosecute, complaining of his having been deprived of the right to a seat in this house, on behalf of himself and a number of electors, who, to the number of 4 or 5000, had given him their votes upon the occasion, what was it his duty to himself, to them, and to the house to do, if he thought this charge was well founded; if he had reason to believe that these practices did actually prevail; what was the duty he owed to the house, to himself, to his constituents, I might even say to the individual who is accused, but to bring it forward where it was sure to be fairly, impartially and thoroughly discussed, in order that it might at least be seen, whether the suspicions that prevailed abroad upon this subject were well or ill founded?&#x2014;What was it incumbent upon him to do more than, if he brought it forward, to bring it fairly forward, and, in the first place, for that purpose to put his cause into the hands of the most respectable solicitors there are in the profession, and I am persuaded that I shall be fortified by the knowledge of every member of this house who knows those gentlemen, that in all the profession there cannot be found gentlemen who stand higher, of purer honour, of greater respectability, and more unblemished character than Messrs. Williams and Brooks, and their clerk, Mr. Powell, who are engaged in the business. More honourable and more respectable persons do not exist in the profession. I hope the house will forgive me, if I presume thus to testify in their behalf; because, if, on a subject of this nature, from any accidental causes witnesses appear on any account to be less deserving of credit, a degree of blame and disgrace may appear to attach to those who are concerned. I do not know whether that May not comprehend all that are concerned on this side, and I
<col>26</col>
therefore have been particularly desirous to present myself upon the occasion and to bear my share of blame upon the subject, at any inconvenience to myself, rather, than shrink from the discharge of my professional duty on behalf of any person for whom I may be employed.&#x2014;Sir, I take the liberty of saying it is of infinite importance, not only to the individual, but to the public, that the persons who deserve the character of honest men, should receive it; because it is of the highest importance, that causes and petitions should be in such hands, rather than that, by their falling into the hands of others, practices should take place which it is not easy to detect. This was the comfort of the person for whom I appear, and whatever representations there may be to the disadvantage of it; whatever judgment gentlemen may be disposed to pass on the evidence they have heard, there is not a single tittle of evidence, much as the witnesses have been pressed, and properly pressed, by questions addressed to them from every quarter; there is not one single tittle which shews that the conduct of the petitioner, from the first moment he was made acquainted with the suspicions respecting the subjects of this charge, was any otherwise than would have been observed by the most honorable man living; having first cautioned the witness who disclosed these facts to him; guarding him not to speak any thing but the truth, and by no means to overstate the truth; having on no occasion offered him any money, or any inducement whatever, not distinctly to disclose the fact, and every subject relating to it. I hope, therefore, I stand fair thus far with the house, that the conduct of the petitioner was from the peril either of losing his testimony or preferring his complaint to the only competent authority to receive it; for it would not have been respectful for the petitioner to have carried his complaint any where else. If there were just grounds to carry a complaint any where, it could be no where but to this house, and it could be conducted only in the way it has been, up to the point I am now stating&#x2014;Sir, permit me to observe in the next place, what are the charges contained in this petition, and what is the evidence in support of it. The petitioner states, that he was a candidate at the last election for the city of Westminster; an unsuccessful candidate in consequence of which he had presented a petition to this house, complaining of an undue election, and praying that that subject might be taken into consideration; that that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0029"/>
<col>27</col>
stood for trial on the 24th of Feb; that that was afterwards postponed till a more distant date, and that intelligence was given to him that persons were actually at work to deprive him of his testimony, to induce persons to go out of the way, and particularly to dispossess him of important documents by which he hoped to support his cause. The petition has fairly and distinctly stated, not in general terms only, who were the persons that had been guilty of this practice; but the names of the witnesses that were sent, or attempted to be sent, out of the way, and the particular circumstances attendant upon the transaction.&#x2014;Sir, it is particularly stated in the petition, that one William Drake was, and still is, a material witness summoned on behalf of your petitioner; that the said Drake having, on or about the 10th of this instant Feb., &amp;c. ["Mr. Plumer here read an extract from the petition ending, "and added, that when they had succeeded in putting it off, such persons should have money to go out of the way to prevent their being summoned."]&#x2014;Now, sir, these are the allegations contained in the petition, which I hope the house will excuse me for having thus specifically read, for the purpose of shewing how specific notice is given to these persons of the charges against them, and the nature of the evidence to be brought.&#x2014;Sir, in support of this petition, you have heard 8 witnesses examined, the witnesses named in the petition, and if they are deserving of credit, upon which subject undoubtedly the house are to decide, but respecting whom it was quite impossible for those who produced them to know, otherwise than that their testimony on paper, or all the account which could be discovered of them was favorable to the testimony they were to give; and such, as induced all those who heard them, truly and honestly to believe the truth of their statement&#x2014;if their account is deserving of credit, the charge is fully, distinctly, and pointedly proved. It is proved in terms, in the very terms of the petition; you have heard those 8 persons actually substantiate the charge against all the individuals who are the subjects of it; they have distinctly told you, that in the early part; of the month of Jan., and particularly in the beginning of Feb., after these witnesses and different persons had been served with a speaker's warrant to give their attendance on the 24th of Feb., Mr. Burgess, who was the solicitor of the sitting member, his agent and manager, proved to be such, and em-
<col>28</col>
ployed by him throughout the whole business&#x2014;Mr. Burgess, who had actually employed a gentleman of the name of Wallis under him, and another person of the name of Gallant, three persons, one employed by the sitting member, and the two others employed by Mr. Burgess in the election business, and paid by him for what they did upon the subject of it, they are all three of them proved by these witnesses, six in number, to have been actually employed.&#x2014;Mr. Burgess in his own person, and also Wallis and Gallant in aid of each other in applying to these witnesses, whom they knew to be at that time served with a speaker's warrant to attend upon the committee, they having express notice of that, and therefore being bound in all fairness, and according to all practice, to abstain from any personal conference or examination of any of them, have proceeded actually to take down their testimony, to get an account of the evidence they were hereafter to give, and knowing perfectly well the nature of that testimony, and how fatal it would be to the cause in which they were engaged, have addressed to these several witnesses topics of argument and propositions, for the purpose of inducing them to withhold that testimony, that they did distinctly inform them of the intention to postpone the hearing of the petition; that it was the intention to apply for that purpose, and that when that application should have been made with success, the consequence would be to leave no longer in force the several warrants with which they had been served&#x2014;that one of them in particular, Mr. Wallis, possessed himself actually, of the speaker's warrant, got it into his own possession, and represented to several of the witnesses, how truly, how justly, and how properly those whom I have the honour to address, know, without my particularly dwelling on that part of the case, but represented to them, that they were no longer under obligation to attend the future trial of the petition, but might in future absent themselves and keep out of the way, offering money for that purpose, inducements to them severally to keep out of the way, to prevent their being forthcoming at the time of the trial of the petition.&#x2014;Questions were put to the witnesses, "for what purpose were you to keep out of the way? Were you conscious of any crime you had committed; of any wrong you had done, that should induce you to absent yourself?" No! Was that the cause of their being desired to keep out of the way, to protect
<image src="S1V0009P0I0030"/>
<col>29</col>
themselves, or to guard against the detection of any crime committed by themselves?&#x2014;Read the evidence:&#x2014;the testimony they have given is, that their evidence has been taken down; that it was discovered that they could detect what had been done during the election; the fictitious votes which had been given; the bribery and corruption which had been committed; the instances in which persons had been induced to give repeated votes at the election. These persons being found capable of giving testimony upon such a subject as that, that was the motive, and not any crime committed individually by themselves; and, therefore, they might with perfect safety, and with perfect truth, answer the questions put, and yet that makes no difference as to the probability of the inducements which were addressed to them, not for their own security, but for the security of those who might be hurt by the testimony they were hereafter to give.&#x2014;Upon this part of the case, as well as upon other parts, undoubtedly the cause which I have to support labours under considerable disadvantage; because I am under the necessity of considering it in this stage of the business, abridged as it must of necessity be, and excluding from the consideration much of the testimony which would be confirmatory of the account thus given; because, with great propriety, the house have confined the enquiry to the endeavouring to remove out of the way written or parole testimony, without entering into the merits of any thing Which passed in the election. You have, therefore, very properly stopped us from going into evidence of the actual practices and the transactions during the election, or of the knowledge of these persons of the contents of that important document on which I shall presently observe. You have necessarily excluded, therefore, all that collateral testimony and account which might be given on that part of the case, and which would confirm or refute all the account thus given of the attempts to keep these witnesses out of the way.&#x2014;The materiality of their testimony; the importance of it; the nature of it; you are all unable Particularly and distinctly to, know; because, of necessity, the case must be deprived of any consideration of that part of the subject; and I forbear to state any part of that on which you cannot receive evidence. But, it is enough for me to state, if their testimony might be material; if their testimony was proper to be received, and the credit to be given to it fit to be considered
<col>30</col>
by a proper tribunal, it is nothing to say they are not witnesses who would be believed; the object of this petition is to prevent the deprivation of testimony. The opportunity of presenting to a proper tribunal that testimony, and surely, at the same moment you exclude the materiality of that testimony, and prevent its being properly examined, it will not be said it is very incredible, that such an attempt should be made, and much less that it is impossible, because the witnesses would not have been credited or cannot prove that which is material. We had a right to have their testimony heard; we had a right to have these witnesses forthcoming; we had a right to keep them untainted, and not visited by the opponent patty at the time they knew they were under orders-to attend on the future tribunal to hear the merits of the case. Therefore, undoubtedly, the conduct of these persons, the solicitor of the sitting member and of Mr. Wallis and Mr. Gallant all employed under him; beginning in the month of Feb. holding out the expectation of the postponement and laying hold of them&#x2014;to address this, argument (whether well or ill founded) was undoubtedly, I should submit, a species of conduct which would receive no sanction or authority from this house.&#x2014;Sir, in addition to that, you hear that in the early part of the month of Feb., namely, on the 10th of that month, soon after the solicitor and the persons employed under him had been thus work with the several witnesses&#x2014;you find, what I am sorry to be under the painful necessity of stating and of bringing directly home to the principal gentleman who is the subject of the charge, by direct positive proof that on the 1Oth of Feb., 14 days only before the hearing of the cause, the witness was sent for by a message to attend at the house of Mr. Homan in Frith Street, soho whom does he meet there? Mr. Homan; Mr. Johnston, a person concerned with Drury Lane Theatre, and a Mr. Edwards, a former servant of the sitting member, and now a box-keeper at Drury Lane theatre. These 3 persons there assembled ply him with liquor, address conversations to him upon the subject, and then remove him upon the day in a hackney coach to the house of Mr.Edwards, and at Mr. Edward's house he there positively states that he met Mr. Sheridan himself; that he had a conference with Mr. Sheridan on the subject that he there distinctly disclosed to Mr. Sheridan that he had an order from the speaker to attend as a witness against him, and not-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0031"/>
<col>31</col>
withstanding, that at the house of Mr. Edwards, to which he was accompanied by Mr. Johnston, at that house he had a conference with Mr. Sheridan, who there entered into conversation with him upon the subject of his future testimony. That witness, who says that he had been in habits of friendship and near alliance with Mr. Sheridan before, and, that he had been acquainted with him to 5 years together, and had been honoured with the greatest marks of, his confidence that one gentleman could give to another&#x2014;has told you, that he was held, in close conference for a considerable time at the house of Mr. Edwards.&#x2014;Now, Sir, it is said this witness has by his demeanour created that general impression to his disadvantage, that no credit is due to what he states; that his appearance has betrayed him, and shewn the strongest marks of his resentment and vengeance and of indignant feelings towards the individual against whom he is giving testimony. Sir, I should only beg leave to observe that this gentleman is no friend of Mr. Panl&#x2014;is no acquaintance of his&#x2014;he is a perfect stranger to him, and if there be any thing exceptionable or improper in his conduct, all he knew of him was, that he was nearly allied to the sitting member; that he had long been honoured with his acquaintance; that he had been in the strictest intimacy with him and visiting in his house; that was all he knew of this gentleman, except that he appeared to be an officer, in a gallant profession, in which he had lost a limb&#x2014;at least it was so represented to him, that he knew nothing of him, but what was apparently honourable and right, except that he came with strong feelings of resentments respecting which very resentment I shall be glad to ask, whence does it arise? Does it not of itself import prior intimacy, and that degree of injury that has stung the individual to manifest all that resentment? How can you account for it otherwise? What has actuated the individual to that resentment?, Let it operate as it ought to do to induce you to receive his evidence with considerable suspicion, with great jealousy, to watch the testimony he gives; but how can any body account for the indignation of this young man? For his feelings of warmth? If the individual was a perfect stranger to him? If he had never been in habits of intimacy with him, or conducted himself in a way to provoke that resentment? How are those feelings to be accounted for? To what cause are you to refer all that gentleman's other feeling, if it is not to be ascribed to the cause I
<col>32</col>
have stated?&#x2014;He has positively stated the circumstance of his alliance to that individual and his acquaintance with him for 5 years together. He has stated his constant employment during the late election at Westminster, in which he is confirmed by the circumstance of the frequent letters that passed: nay, Sir, I think that receives confirmation even from the question put by that right hon. gent. himself; for I do remember the question being put, not indeed to him, but to the, second witness; Weatherhead, in these terms, "Were you not introduced to me by Mr. Drake as a clergyman?" The answer to that is immaterial on the present occasions He says he told him it was a mistake, and that it was his brother; but the use I make of it is this, and the house will then see, whether it is worthy of their grave and serious consideration. With all humility, it appears to me to contain pregnant proof of prior intimacy and acquaintance&#x2014;how could Mr. Drake introduce any body to that right hon. gent. if he was a stranger him? How could he have access to him? How could he be accompanied to his house to introduce any body if he was not in habits of intimacy and acquaintance with him? This is a question put to him by the highest authority&#x2014;and it carries the highest proof that some degree of intimacy at least subsisted between them.&#x2014;A particular account is given by the witness on the subject of this meeting, and that I may not in the least misrepresent him, I will read it. You will find that he gives this account, that he had been long in habits of acquaintance and connection with him; that he had hopes and prospects held out to him of promotion and promises of money, in which he had been disappointed; that he had still been en active and zealous friend to the right hon. gent, during the late election, but that at, the close of the election he felt himself neglected&#x2014;personally insulted by the domestics of the right hon. gent., and stung, undoubtedly, with resentment, and feeling a resentment to that right hon. gent. he was induced to do what I do not mean to state as a proof of the honour or propriety of this gentleman to betray his friend, and communicate intelligence to his opponent of the knowledge, that he had of what ,practices had been going on during the election.&#x2014;Now, sir, I do not in the least mean to conceal that the testimony of a witness standing in that predicament, a person who betrays his former patron and friend, nearly allied to him, and who gives intelligence of practices in which he has been personally
<image src="S1V0009P0I0032"/>
<col>33</col>
concerned ought not, on that account, to be received with considerable suspicion&#x2014;he is an accomplice, and his testimony ought to be received with suspicion, but I beg leave to state, that the testimony of accomplices under more unfavourable circumstances is continually received, and many have lost their lives upon testimony open to every possible observation that can be bestowed upon this; he states fairly the account of it upon his own testimony; he gives the narrative how he was originally connected with the right hon. gent. for 5 years together, and then he says "I supported Mr. Sheridan during the whole of the time of the election, and brought up many votes for Mr. Sheridan, and was in the habit of seeing him 4 or 5 times a day." He then relates the circumstance of his going to Homan's house, having wine there, and afterwards going to Edward's, &amp;c.&#x2014; He is then interrogated with respect to the letter he represents Mr. Sheridan as having been desirous of obtaining, and he gives a narrative, and the short account, respecting the letter is this: It is proved by this witness, and by the next who was examined, that prior to the election, a letter had been signed by Mr. Sheridan in favour of a person of the name of Emanuel Harris, recommending him to supply the fleet with different articles in which he dealt, upon the occasion of his obtaining votes and his voting himself during the election; that that first letter was in the hand-writing of the witness, Drake himself, was delivered by himself a few days prior to the election into the hands of Mr. Sheridan, that he did himself annex the letters, M. P., leaving a blank for the signature, and that upon his delivering it to Mr. Sheridan, he received it back from Mr. Sheridan with his own signature to it.&#x2014;The evidence that was given by Mr. Drake respecting the two letters, one that preceded and the other that followed a few days the commencement of the election, will be found in different parts of the testimony of that witness: he was examined upon that subject in chief and afterwards pointedly by the house, and, particularly in a pointed and rapid manner by an hon. member of the house on the subject of these letters, and the prompt and immediate answers given, to thole questions pushed one after another rapidly on him on the subject of those letters had, I own, to my view, greatly an appearance, excluding all probability, of a manufactured or a made stoty; for that any person of any ability much less an individual
<col>34</col>
like him, unaccustomed to courts of justice and to being examined, should be able so rapidly to give distinct answers as to time, place, and person, and every circumstance connected with it, does appear to me to have a very great degree of probability connected with it.&#x2014;I fear I shall not be able to extract from this volume I have in my hand every part of the testimony respecting the letter, but I hope the house will excuse me if I should not be able to do it immediately; they will excuse me if I should occupy any great portion of their time after what has passed in reading it. "When I went to Mr. Sheridan with this letter, I said here is a man, &amp;c. which Mr. Sheridan who is "present cannot deny."&#x2014;He then states applications by the other persons who are mentioned in the petition, Homan, Edwards, and Johnston; and then he goes on to say, "I then told Mr. Sheridan. I had "been summoned, &amp;c."&#x2014;He is then asked, by the house, "did Mr. Sheridan say anything? &amp;c."&#x2014;A question is put to him by the house respecting the letter; he is asked particularly, "are you sure that you "either, read the letter? &amp;c"&#x2014;He is then interrogated about his acquaintance with Mr. Harris, and he states how he became acquainted with him?&#x2014;He is then asked, "who advised you to destroy the first? &amp;c".&#x2014;He is then asked whether he hart ever declared that he would have money from one side or the other, which he denies&#x2014;he says, "I never did in my life."&#x2014;There are other passages respecting the signature of this letter, but I hope I have shewn you that the account I originally,gave respecting this letter, having been thus delivered to Mr. Sheridan, add received back from him with what the witness took to be his signature was correct; and surely it will never be argued, that if a letter is delivered to Mr. Sheridan in blank, if the witness was not actually present to see him put his name to it, but if he received it back with a signature purporting to be Mr. Sheridan himself, that is not sufficient to fix the right hon. gent. with the act itself, more especially when it is also fixed by the witness, which it is in both instances, to be the signature of Mr. Sheridan himself&#x2014;Mr. Weatherhead was interrogated about the letters; he saw, I believe, both the letters: he spoke of the signature of one having seen it wet, and he judged it to be the signature of Mr. Sheridan. He was particularly interrogated whether he had ever said any thing as to its
<image src="S1V0009P0I0033"/>
<col>35</col>
being a forgery; he said no: and that the reason that one was substituted for another was, that the first had received a blot from being folded, and that it had M. P.; the putting M. P. being improper when the parliament was not assembled, and that the man was desirous of having a letter with a fairer signature, and also having the words "Treasurer of the Navy," which were actually put to the second letter to give more authenticity to it.&#x2014;This is the account of these two witnesses, on the subject of this letter; in addition to which, Mr. Weatherhead has proved, what it did seem to me if Mr. Weatherhead is entitled to credit.&#x2014;I state this with all the humility which belongs to me; leaving it entirely to the judgment of the house to pronounce on the credit of the witnesses. I can only judge of the testimony before me, and it is my duty to state that testimony to the house. I say again, if Mr. Weatherhead is entitled to credit his testimony alone goes a considerable way towards substantiating the charge before you; for it is positively proved, that he actually saw on the 19th of Feb. at the house of Mr. Sheridan, Drake the witness, and Mr. Sheridan sitting close together, and as he describes it "elbowing each other close together in the act of private conversation in a low tone of voice not to be overheard by any body else." He says that that continued for some period of time in the room. Did that conversation pass, or did it not?&#x2014;Weatherhead declares it did&#x2014;if it did, how could that conversation be passing, circumstanced as Drake then was, when he had in the early part of the month, or even perhaps in the latter end of Jan., but certainly in the early part of Feb., not only been actually served with a speaker's warrant to attend as a witness, but on the 10th of that month of Feb., actually communicated to Mr. Sheridan himself, that he was under summons to attend at the hearing of the petition on the part of Mr. Paull, when Mr. Sheridan had said to him, "leave that to me." Nine days afterwards, within 5 days of the hearing of the petition, which was to be heard on the 24th, Mr. Sheridan is seen at his own house in close conversation with Mr. Drake, sitting close together, and in some conversation which was not to be heard by any body else. if that fact be true, does it not confirm the testimony of the other witness; and is it consistent with any possible account of the denial of all intimacy or acquaintance with that witness, circumstanced as that witness was, which

excluded, as it seemed to me, every possibility of conversation which could not be distinctly heard which had not reference to the subject?&#x2014;But, sir, it does not rest there. This witness positively states the actually seeing the letters delivered into the hands of Mr. Sheridan&#x2014;he saw them when they came back with the signature of Mr. Sheridan wet; he proves also, that Mr. Sheridan at this meeting on the 19th of Feb. addressed a conversation to him, personally, on the subject of these letter., and that at the close of that conversation he made to Mr. Weatherhead a request, which I own I feel an extreme difficulty in referring to, in any other way than as a direct confirmation of the whole account thus given on the subject.&#x2014;That Mr. Sheridan said to him, do you and Mr. Drake come to me tomorrow at two o'clock.&#x2014;This was after the private conversation with Mr. Drake; after interrogating him on the subject of the letters and enquiry of Mr. Weatherhead, another witness under summons to attend, he asks him, are you actually employed on the other side?&#x2014;he says no then, says he, do you and Mr. Drake come to me tomorrow at two o'clock. For what purpose were they to come the next day to Mr. Sheridan?&#x2014;Why were they to be invited to come? In what way can that possibly be explained consistent with the representation of no connection subsisting between these parties. &#x2014;Sir, this, together with the other evidence I have stated of the other persons employed; the solicitor, Mr. Burgess, Mr. Wallis employed by the solicitor, Mr. Gallant, who was employed under them during the election, the proof of the conduct of Mr. Homan in Frith-street, the proof of Mr. Edwards and Mr. Johnston's applications on the subject of these letters and of the witnesses, constitutes the testimony lying before you in proof of this petition, <i>in verbis</i>, in terms, by the. 8 witnesses who have been examined at your bar.&#x2014;I have now, sir, discharged my duty to the house by stating the petition and stating the import, I hope fairly stating, the nature of the testimony adduced in support of it. I have cautiously abstained from entering upon any one topic that is not directly connected with the subject before you. I will not detain the house one moment with any recapitulation or any observations on the subject. I leave it entirely with the house to pronounce their judgment upon it. I am persuaded that it will be a wise, a just, and a proper judgment, that they will attentively read the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0034"/>
<col>37</col>
evidence for themselves, with opportunities of seeing it and of examining it better than it has been in my power to obtain; they will weigh it, and finally give that judgment which is best calculated to vindicate their own honour and dignity, and which will be satisfactory to every person by whom that testimony shall be hereafter read. I beg pardon for detaining the house so long, and return my humble thanks to the house for their patience."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>protested, that he was never more surprised at any thing than at the speech which he had just heard from the learned counsel. He had heard rumours that he intended to have thrown up his brief. But, if he was surprised, he was not alarmed. The learned counsel had said that he (Mr. S.) had an advantage over the petitioner. He denied this, as he had not availed himself of the assistance of counsel. If he had been capable of stating, as proved matter, that which had been only asserted, and that too by witnesses who had been nearly commited by the house for scandalous prevarication&#x2014;if he had stated every thing in the evidence that made for him, and none that made against him, and had the stupidity to think that the house would believe him, then he might be said to have the advantage. He expressed his high respect for the profession, but thought there were limits within which counsel ought to confine themselves; and certainly it would have been much more proper if the counsel, instead of pressing the matter as he did, had stood at the bar in shame and confusion at his being engaged in such a cause. He perfectly admitted the great respectability of the solicitors; Messrs Williams and Brooks, and had heard that Mr. Williams had even thrown up the cause. He wished that Mr. Powell might stand as clear. He wished, that Mr. Paull and Mr. Powell might have been only dupes in the business. He should be glad if it should appear so. But when he examined his witnesses, there would appear, he believed, such a system of baseness, corruption, and subornation of perjury as had never before been heard of. He wished the counsel for the petitioner to hear the evidence. The learned counsel, though he remarked on the part the evidence where Drake had stated, that he had been employed by him (Mr. S ) to get the letter from Harris, had forgot to mention that the witness had afterwards stated, that he had offered &#x00A3;30 of his own money to get the letter-from Mr, Paull. His own money! He wished it
<col>38</col>
might not turn out to have been the money, of other people. He really pitied the poor wretches who had been called to to the bar, but wished that the charge might not be carried to a higher quarter. The counsel, too had observed upon the statements of the witness, that he saw him sign the letter, but had forgot to mention his having retracted that assertion. He had adverted to his having desired the attendance of Drake and Weatherhead the next day&#x2014;he had done so certainly, with a view to carry them to Bow street. But finding, as Weatherhead had said, that they had got into suspicious company, when they saw a Bow-street officer they made off, and he had heard no more of them till they were observed on the 24th of Feb. in a hackney-coach with Mr. Paull. He was ashamed of his own credulity in having given any credit to what these persons said, but he had called at the Admiralty, and found that Weatherhead had been dismissed for scandalous conduct by captain Trollope, and that his name was marked R. M. having presented forged certificates for a lieutenancy. There was a gross false-hood in the petition, where it alledged that the consideration of the election petition stood for the 24th of Feb., whereas it had been originally appointed for the 13th of Jan.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the right hon. gent. had certainly taken the advantage over the counsel when he had spoken, of him in the manner he had done. There might have been rumours of his intention to throw up his brief; but when so much was at stake with respect to the client who employed him, it was not for the counsel to prejudge the case, and if he had heard ,that he had thrown up his brief, he certainly would not have believed it. It was impossible to misunderstand the counsel when he said that these charges were proved, for he had distinctly qualified it by referring this to the credit due to the,witnesses. There,was, therefore, no more grounds for his imputations against the counsel, than for his assertion that there was a gross falsehood in the petition. It stated, that the consideration of the election petition glad been postponed from the 24th of Feb to the 14th of April. This was true, and no intention appeared of denying that it had been in the first instance fixed for the 13th of January.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that he had a great respect for the counsel; but still though that he ought to have been somewhat more liberal. If the allegation it was at least a
<image src="S1V0009P0I0035"/>
<col>39</col>
pitiful prevarication. He moved that Frerick Homan be called in.<lb/>
A long conversation then took place with respect to the propriety of examining Mr. Homan, he being implicated by the allegations of the petition. However, on the motion of Mr. Perceval, it was carried, that the allegations against Mr. Homan were not well grounded; and he was, therefore, admitted as a comperent witness.<lb/>

"Were you present at a meeting between Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Drake, on the 9th or 10th of Feb.? The 19th I was present.&#x2014;At a meeting at Somerset Place? Yes.&#x2014;Did Mr. Drake come upon any request of Mr. S., or did Mr. Drake apply to you? Mr. Drake called upon me on the 19th Of Feb. in the evening. He told me, he had returned from the country that evening with Mr. Weatherhead; that he had been in a chaise to Hampshire; that he was going to set off at 4 the next morning, to take possession of a cottage be had purchased in Hampshire, and wished to see Mr. S. that night; I told him, I was to dine with Mr. S., and should engage he should see Mr. S. at 7 or 8 o'clock. I went to Mr. S's. to see him; after I had been there some time, he came in with Mr. Weatherhead, whom he introduced as a clergyman. Mr. Weatherhead and I, and Mr. Ward, sat in the parlour at Mr. S's. for some time ; we had general conversation; at length Mr.S. came in from, I believe, the house of commons, about 8 o'clock. When Mr S. came into the room to be saluted, Mr, Drake and. Mr. Weatherhead were sitting at some distance from him, and Mr. S. took a chair, and sat at a considerable distance from Mr. Drake; there was room for More than 2 or 3 chairs between the chair on which Mr. S. sat and Mr. Drake. There was a general conversation alter Mr. S. came in, on some motion he had Made in the house that night, or that he had given notice of a motion. Mr Drake told Mr. S., he had been in the country, in Hampshire, and had been hunting there with Mr. Cobbett. I staid there the whole time; there was no conversation could have taken place without my hearing it, and Mr. Ward, who was present, Some time after Mr. Drake came in or Mr. S. came in, he asked who that gentleman was in the corner; Mr. Drake said he was a particular friend of his, a shipmate of his, Mr. Weatherhead; I replied, he is a clergyman; Oh! said Mr. S., you served as chaplain, I
<col>40</col>
suppose, along with Mr. Drake; no, sir, says he, not as chaplain! Oh! Oh! says Drake, immediately correcting himself, it is his brother is a clergyman, this is not a clergyman. Mr. S. certainly made no offer; there could have been no offer made to Mr. Drake that evening, as stated in the petition. On the 19th of Feb., I remained in the room with Mr. S. till Mr. Drake and Mr. Weatherhead left the house. On going up stairs to Mr. S's dining-room, he said he believed that Drake was a very great liar; that he did not suppose that he had been hunting with Mr. Cobbett, for that he believed that Mr. Cobbett would not take notice of such a fellow, and that he would not be concerned in such a business with such a rascal; and, says he, that story is like the story of the Thisbe brig which he has got: he is a damned liar.&#x2014;Had the conversation, as to Mr. Drake's having been with Mr. Cobbett in Hampshire, begun previous to Mr. S's. coming into the room and in what way did Mr. Drake state himself to have been in Mr. Cobbett's house? The conversation began with Mr Drake stating himself to have been hunting in Hampshire with Mr. Cobbett, before Mr. S. came into the room, but it continued after Mr S. came into the room: Mr. Drake said, that the only way to get to Mr. Cobbett's house was through his stables and a very dirty yard; that he lived in a mere pig-stye.&#x2014;Did you ever hear Mr Drake say that he must leave town in order to take the command of the Thisbe sloop, or the Sisbe sloop, and that be was under orders from the Admiralty? On Tuesday the 10th of Feb., I remember being in company with Mr. Drake. Mr. Drake told me that he was appointed to the command of the Thisbe sloop; sometime afterwards he said that it was a brig; and that if Mr. S. would apply to the Admiralty, he had no doubt they would permit him to stay in town a few days, if it was to serve his cause.&#x2014;When Mr. Drake said he must go out of town the next day; did Mr. S. tell Mr. Drake he must stay in town, and desire him to call at Somerset House the next; and did not Mr. S. state that that he, Mr. Drake, must on no account be absent when the speaker's warrant required his attendance? Mr. S. certainly did.&#x2014;Did Mr. S. ever utter one word like holding out any reward or inducement to Mr. Drake, or Mr. Weatherhead, whatever? Never in my presence,&#x2014;Were you present at the examination of Mr. Harris by Mr. Justice Grabam? I was present,&#x2014;Was Mr. Weatherhead pre-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0036"/>
<col>41</col>
sent? No.&#x2014;Did you know that when Mr. S. sent Harris to be examined by Mr. Graham, he sent a special message, by Mr. Johnston and yourself, that Mr. Graham should get possession of the letter pretended to be signed by Mr. S , have it sealed up and marked, and give notice to the speaker and Mr. Paull's solicitor that it should be forthcoming to the house.&#x2014;What was the message Mr. S. sent by you and Mr. Johnson to Mr. Graham? Mr. S. desired Mr. Johnson to request Mr. Graham would keep the letter, seal it, and let Mr. Paull's solicitor know that the letter was in his possession, in Mr. Graham's possession; after his examinations had been taken, to keep the letter, and not to let it go into the jew's hands any more.&#x2014;Did Mr. Harris shew any reluctance to accompany you and Mr. Johnson to be examined? No, Mr. Harris went with great seeming pleasure: he wished that his character should be cleared up; as some people said he had obtained the letter in an improper manner: he wished that every investigation should take place; and he gave his testimony very fairly and candidly as it appeared to me, without any reserve."<lb/>
<i>Cross-examined by Mr. Warren, on behalf of the Petitioner.</i><lb/>
"What is your situation in life? I am of no profession at present.&#x2014;Are you a gentle man, living on your means? I have been concerned in the flour business in Ireland, have property in Ireland; I do not say that I am concerned in the flour business at present, but that is the only occupation I have been concerned in.&#x2014;How long have you left off that business? I left it off when I found it unprofitable, about 12 months ago. &#x2014;Do you know Drake's father? I know, a person whom I believe to be Drake's father; I cannot say whether he is Drake's father or not, I have rho reason to doubt it.&#x2014;Did you ever write to a person whom you suppose to be Drake's father? I did.&#x2014;Did you believe him to be Drake's father when you wrote to him? I did.&#x2014;Do you state now that you only suppose him to be Drake's father? As to supposition I do not know, I have no reason to doubt his being Drake's father.&#x2014; Where do you live? At 29, Knightsbridge. Did you ever see live in Frith-street? I did.&#x2014;Did you ever see Drake in Frith Street? Yes.&#x2014;Did any conversation take place on the subject of a letter to Emanuel Harris? Yes.&#x2014;State what that was. On the 10th of Feb. Shrove Tuesday, Drake came to my house. The day before that, the investigation had taken place before Mr. Graham,
<col>42</col>
the magistrate. That evening he called on me, I asked him if he had written a letter, and got it signed by Mr. S., as was stated by Harris in his examinations; he said that he had given Harris a letter, but that Harris was a very great rascal, and a fellow not to be depended on, and made use of some very improper language; at the same time he told me he had got the letter, and that Mr. S. gave it Harris: I told him that Harris had stated in his examinations, which were taken by Mr. Graham, that Drake obtained a sum of money for a letter for Harris, that Harris gave him a sum of money for the letter which he obtained for him, signed by Mr. S., and he said it is not material about Harris, he is a very great rascal, but he dare not appear, he is afraid of me; I have written two letters to him this week, desiring him to keep out of the way, and not to appear. I told him certainly, that in writing those two letters it appeared to me he had injured his character very much, in desiring a witness, who had been served with an order to attend this house, to keep out of the way; and as to the other letter, I said, I suppose it is of no consequence, but your letters will injure your own character. I told him that. He then said that he did not care, that he would get the letter; that Mr. S. had used him very ill; he had been dancing after him many years, and made him many promises; and that he was offered money by the other party, and that he was determined to give Mr. S. up.&#x2014;Did you say to Drake, it would be a good thing if he could get that letter from Harris? No.&#x2014;Did you say any thing about getting the letter from Harris? NO.&#x2014;When did the acquaintance between you and Drake begin? That evening.&#x2014;Was there any wine drank that evening? Yes&#x2014;Much? No, not much. Mr. Drake told me that evening that he could drink 6 bottles of claret without affecting him; and I.told him, as an Irishman, I had no objection to take a bottle of wine with him. He told me he was an Irishman, but a few days afterwards his father told me he was not an Irishman.&#x2014;At this first meeting between you and Drake, you sat down and took wine together? Yes.&#x2014;Did any further conversation take place between you and-Drake?. Nothing material took place, that I recollect.&#x2014;How came yon to write a letter to Drake's father? On going to to Mr. S. s. house another gentleman who was there, and I, advised Mr. S. to have Drackeand Weatherhead both brought before Mr. Graham, the magistrate; and to

try if we could not make out a conspiracy between the 3; and I wrote two notes to Mr. Drake's father, to induce him to come to that meeting, in which we intended to bring him to the magistrate.&#x2014;Had you any communication with Mr. S. on the subject of those letters; did he know that they were written? No, Mr. S. never knew that I wrote to him,or any other person, I believe, except those concerned.&#x2014;Did be know of it? I never mentioned it to him.&#x2014;Did Mr. Graham know of it? No, he did not.&#x2014;At the meeting at Somerset House on the 19th of Feb., who was present? Mr. Drake, Mr. Weatherhead, Mr. Ward, Mr. Sheridan, and your humble servant.&#x2014;Do you mean to state that you heard no conversation upon the subject of money, between Mr. S. and Mr. Drake, at that meeting? Certainly not, and no such conversation could have taken
place.&#x2014;Did not Mr. S. say, I believe Mr. Drake, you are poor, and I have it now in my power to place you in such a situation as will make you comfortable? No, nor nothing like it.&#x2014;Were any other letters written to Drake's father besides that you have mentioned? Not by me.&#x2014;Do you know of any other being written to Drake's father? No, I do not.&#x2014;Did not you appoint a meeting between Mr. S. and Drake at his own house? I wrote to him for that purpose.&#x2014;Whom did you write to? I wrote to Drake's father; I dare say you have the notes there.&#x2014;I just asked whether you knew of any other letter besides the one you have mentioned? I wrote two notes.&#x2014;Besides the letter? I wrote no letter to him.&#x2014;I understood you to state, that you had written a letter to Drake's father? I wrote two notes to Drake's father.&#x2014;Did not Drake go from your house to Edwards's, to meet Johnson? I do not know where he went to from my house; I did not accompany him.&#x2014;Did not Drake go from your house with Johnson, in a hackney coach, to meet Mr. Sheridan? I do not know.&#x2014;What was the date of the last note to Drake's father? I cannot say what the date was, but I know it was for the purpose of getting him to appoint a meeting, for the purpose of bringing them to Mr. Graham's; I believe there was nothing more than "Thursday" or "Monday."&#x2014;Was it not written on Saturday, the 22d of Feb.? I do not know; it might be.&#x2014;Was it to meet Mr. Sheridan on Sunday? I believe it was.&#x2014;Where was it to meet Mr, S.? I really do not know whether it was at my house, or Mr. S.'s; but I advised Mr. S. not to bring them to his house, and I am not certain
<col>44</col>
whether it was not my house. Mr. Drake wished me to go to his house, but I did not choose to go there, and also to bring Mr. S. there, to his lodgings.&#x2014;Do you know whether Mr. S. has a son of the name of Charles Sheridan? No.&#x2014;A brother? No.&#x2014;A nephew, or any other relation? There is a person of that name who lives with me; we live together; he is unwell, or he would have been here.&#x2014;Did not Alex. Johnson and Drake go together from your house? A. Johnson, Mr. Ward, and Mr. Drake, and I believe 2 or 3 more went away together; I cannot say where they went to."</membercontribution></p>

I did.&#x2014;Were you so situate as to be able to hear every thing that passed between Mr. S. and Drake? was, I was nearer to Mr. S. than Drake was; there was no low tone of voice made use of by the company, and it was impossible for Mr. S to have made any offer to Mr. Drake or Mr. Weatherhead, that evening.&#x2014;You are certain nothing then passed which you did not hear? Positively.&#x2014;And you are certain nothing passed between them on the subject of money?

He expressed the wish equally to Mr. Johnson and me.&#x2014;Did you deliver that message to the magistrate? I am not certain that I did; Mr. Johnson was the principal person; he attended the next day, and I did not; I know Mr. S, requested it, but I will not say that I delivered it.&#x2014;If you did not deliver the message yourself, did you hear it delivered to Mr. Graham in your presence?

He stated generally, that he believed he was a bad character.&#x2014;Did Mt. S. state. any reason for believing him to butt bad character, within his knowledge? That he had been living an idle life on the town, a dissolute life.&#x2014;Do you mean to say, that my. S. stated, that leading an idle and dissolute life was proof of a bad character? I made that inference.&#x2014;Did Mr. S., at the time he desired you to go to Mr. Homan's, say any thing to you as to any acquaintance with him during the Westminster election? No, he did not.&#x2014;You have stated that Wetherhead was introduced at Mr. S.'s house by Drake as a clergyman? Yes.&#x2014;How came you to be there; were you desired to meet Drake? I was invited to dine with Mr. S., and was waiting for his return from the house.&#x2014;Did you, before you went, know that Drake was to be there? I did not.&#x2014;Was any surprize expressed by Mr. S. at Drake introducing an acquaintance of this description? He was surprized at seeing two gentlemen; in the room.&#x2014;when you say that he was surprized at seeing two gentlemen in the room,. do you mean that he expressed any surprize at seeing strangers, or that he acknowledged them as acquaintance? He acknowledged
<col>48</col>
Drake as an acquaintance undoubtedly, and Drake introduced Mr. Wetherhead as a perfect stranger.&#x2014;What was the surprize Mr. S. expressed at Drake introducing a stranger? I do not know how to answer that question, I cannot distinguish the kind of surprize.&#x2014;You have stated that you were nearer to Drake at this Meeting on the 19th of Feb., than Mr. S. was? No, I was not nearer to him, but I was standing before the fire.&#x2014;You certainly stated that there was no whispering? Certainly I did.&#x2014;And that nothing could have been stated, or said there, which you should not have heard? Certainly.&#x2014;How came you to pay such particular attention to the conduct of Mr. S. that day? Because I suspected that there was some improper motive in bringing Mr. Wetherhead there.&#x2014;Did yon know Mr. Wetherhead before? No, but I had heard Drake's character, and when he brought an acquaintance there, I thought they were similar.&#x2014;Had you not heard Mr. Drake's character from Mr. S.? I had, on the 10th&#x2014;Were you not desired to come there by Mr. S. on purpose to be a witness of what was going on? No, I was asked to dine there.&#x2014;Did you ever hear Mr. S. say any thing about the bad-character of Drake, till a charge was made against Mr. S. himself? I heard it upon, the 10th of Feb.?&#x2014;Did you ever hear any thing against the character of Drake from Mr. S. before the 10th of Feb? I never heard his name mentioned.&#x2014;Did not Mr. S. on the 10th of Feb., when he mentioned the bad character of Drake, inform you that Drake was to be a witness against him? He did not."</p>

We did, in the same coach.&#x2014;Did you go away together in consequence of any proposition or arrangement that took place on tho evening of the 10th? Mr. Drake expressed great anxiety to see Mr. S. that evening, the only evening he had; Mr. Edwards got a coach, and I of course went with that.&#x2014;Do you know that Mr. S. was brought from sir Gilbert Heathcote's to South-street? I mentioned what I knew to Mr. T. S. and he wrote a note to his father Mr. S.&#x2014;What conversation passed between Drake and Mr. S. when Mr. S. came to Somerset-place?

<p><i>Aaron Graham, Esq. examined by the House.</i></p>
<p>"Do you recollect receiving a letter from Mr. Sheridan, desiring you to do Mr. S. the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0040"/>
<col>49</col>
favour of coming to Somerset-place, to examine a person? It was the 9th of, Feb.&#x2014;Have you the letter with you? I have. [Mr. Graham delivered it in, and it was read.]&#x2014;What answer or communication did Mr. S. receive from you upon the subject? The person who brought me the letter was a Mr. Johnston, belonging to the theatre. I returned for answer, that I did not think it at all proper to go down to Somerset House to take the examination; that if the party had done any thing improper, which required an examination, if the party was sent to me, I would take the examination.&#x2014;In consequence of that, did Mr. Harris, accompanied by Mr. Johnston and Mr. Homan, attend you? In about half an hour afterwards Mr. Johnston returned with a man by the name of Harris, and said he was the person whom Mr. S. wished to be examined.&#x2014;Did Harris swear to the examination? I took his examination in writing, and he signed it, and swore to it.&#x2014;Have you the examination with you? I have; it was taken in two days, because, before I had finished with him, I was obliged to leave for a business which required my attention, and I finished with him the next morning.&#x2014;Had not you a communication from Mr. S., that it was his wish that you should keep the paper with a notice to the Speaker, or to Mr. Paull's solicitor, that it should be forthcoming? Such a request was made to me by Mr. Johnston. I did keep it one night, not on account of that, but because I had not finished the examination; when the examination was closed I should have thought it highly improper to keep a thing which was to be produced.&#x2014;Did you mark the letter? I made him mark the letter, to see that it was the same letter that I returned again next day.&#x2014;Was Mr. S. present at either of the examinations either day? Certainly not.&#x2014;Did Mr. S. see you to converse with you respecting the examinations, or did he see the examination till last Sunday? The only communication which passed on the subject was, that I sent a message by Mr. Johnston. I think that I had gone through the examination, that I was perfectly satisfied in my own mind that Harris had got the letter from Drake, and that I wished he would send Drake to me, that I might learn whom he got from. Mr. Johnston afterwards called to tell me that he had seen. Drake, and endeavoured to prevail on him to come to me, but could not do it.&#x2014;Did Mr. J. know the particulars of that examination? Mr. J. was present at the examination.</p>

<title>Emanuel Harris examined by the House.</title>
<p>How came you first to see Mr. Sheridan, or to go to Somerset-place? I was served with a Speaker's warrant from the house of commons by Mr. Boswell of Gosport; he applied to me several times for the letter I received from Mr. Drake.&#x2014;Was any money or temptation held out to you by Mr. Boswell, or any other person, to give up that letter? When Mr. Boswell served me with the warrant, a day or two after he met me, and says, Mr. Harris, do you want any money? I said, no, Mr. Boswell. There was a gentleman by the name of Mr. Joseph, who keeps a shop at Gosport; he said, Harris, do you hear what Mr. Boswell said? I said, I do, sir; he then said, will you go up tonight with me in a post-chaise? I said, no, sir; I am going up, but I shall go up in the stage: I did not go up that night, but a night or two after. When I arrived in town on the 5th of Feb. I was not scarce half an hour in my house when Mr. Boswell and Mr. Jukes, the banker from Gosport, arrived at my house; they came and applied to me for the letter I had from Mr. Drake, signed R. B. Sheridan, Treasurer of the. Navy. I immediately went away; I told them to wait a little, I would let them know in a minute whether I would let them have it or not I made my way out of the house, and went over to Mr. Sheridan's house; I live in Holy well-street. When I went into Mr. Sheridan's, I saw Mr. Burgess, he was there, and I told him the case, that there were two gentlemen at my house; I have a letter so and so, which I have by me; there are two gentlemen want it: I do not know whether I do right to deliver that letter out of my hands, as I have a Speaker's warrant which I shall obey. I went away. Mr. Burgess told Mr. Jukes and Mr. Boswell that he would send them to Bow-street, if they came to inquire for the letter, Which they had no right to do; however they went away that day. At that time Mr. Burgess said, Mr. Harris, I shall come to you presently again; I said very well, sir. He came to me about an hour after; I said, how do you do, Mr. Burgess? he said, how, do you do Mr. Harris ? He said, I shall be very happy to see you this evening, about 5 o'clock; I said, I will attend you; I shall be at home. He came and asked, will you have the goodness to walk over to Mr. Sheridan's? I did, and took the letter with me, and showed it to Mr. Sheridan. After a few words I went home, and they applied for the letter again, and I told Mr. Burgess of it,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0041"/>
<col>51</col>
and Mr. Burgess and Mr. Sheridan advised me to let them have the letter, which I told them I could not by any means; as I had a warrant from the house of commons to produce it, I should certainly obey it. They said, they thought it could not be any harm for me to give it up; I said, I could not do any thing of the kind.&#x2014;Did not Mr. Burgess advise you to deliver the letter to a messenger of this house? I do say so.&#x2014;Had not you another letter, some considerable time before yon had this letter, purporting to be signed by Mr. Sheridan?. Yes, pretty near a month I dare say; being blotted, I showed it to my friends, and asked them what they thought of the letter? they said, if you can get one with the signature of it more plain, it will be better. I went back to Mr. Drake and said, I should thank you, Mr. Drake, if you could get a letter signed more plain by Mr. Sheridan, the Treasurer of the Navy; but that letter had M. P. to it, which I thought not proper, as there was no parliament.&#x2014;What was the distance of time between your receiving the first and the second letter? About 3 months, when Mr. Drake was so long about giving me the other letter. I will tell you the particulars: I paid him for the letter, I gave him money for his trouble. I says, Mr. Drake, if you will get me a letter which will be of great service to me in my business, you shall not do it for nothing: he said, well, Harris, what will you give me? I said, will a 10l. note satisfy you? he said, yes, as you are a neighbour, I do not wish so much as that; I will be satisfied with 5; however, Mr. Drake has had to the amount of 51. 8s. of me for the letter.&#x2014;When Mr. S. expressed his surprise at your believing it possible for him to have signed that letter, did you not state that admiral Colpoys and admiral Parker, and others had signed such letters? Yes, and I can name the parties; it is an usual thing for gentlemen to give such letters. There is the duke of Clarence; Mr. Zachariah has one.&#x2014;Did you not go of yourself, voluntarily, and give your evidence to Mr. Graham? I certainly did. When I applied to Mr. S. I said I would advertise Mr. Drake, when I heard the letter was a forgery. Mr. S. said "it is a pity to do that; he will "receive his punishment." I wished several times to advertise him, because I could not find him.&#x2014;Was any means taken by Mr. Drake to offer you money, or reward, to get that letter out of your possession? There is a gentleman of the name of Mr.
<col>52</col>
Dawes, who can prove that he offered me money; and he said he would take me to a place, and I should not come to any harm. He offered me 30 or 40; and I said, I would not for any sum give the letter out of my hands to any person.&#x2014;To whom is the letter addressed? I have the letter; it is to captains and commanders of his majesty's ships of war. I have the letter here. He stated that the signature only was Mr. S's. writing.&#x2014;[The letter was read, and is as follows:] " London, . Nov. 3, 1806.&#x2014;Sir, The bearer is a respectable tradesman; and if you will permit him to serve the ship under your command, I am certain justice will be done to every man on board that employs him to fit him out with clothes, &amp;c.; and in so doing you will greatly oblige your obedient, &amp;c. R. B. Sheridan. Somerset Place, Treasurer of the Navy. To Captains and Commanders of His Majesty's Ships of War."&#x2014;Had you yourself ever any personal knowledge of Mr. S's. hand-writing? No.&#x2014;Had you ever the slightest intercourse with Mr. S. before this time? Never before the 5th of Feb. last.&#x2014;Was the first or the second letter connected with any condition, that you should procure for Mr. S. any number of votes for the Westminster election? NO, not one; I am sorry to say that I did not get one vote.&#x2014;To the best of your knowledge, what became of the first letter? I asked Mr. Drake what became of the first letter; and he said he destroyed it, because he did not think two should be in circulation.&#x2014;You gave it back to Mr. Drake? Yes; I asked him how it became so blotted, and he said Mr. S. dried it with the cuff of his coat.&#x2014;That was 3 or 4 months before the second letter was obtained? About a month, or 5 weeks.</p>

<title>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifford, on behalf of the Petitioner.</title>
<p>Look at that signature (R. B. Sheridan); it appeals to be blotted, does, not it? Yes.&#x2014;Were you present when that blotting took place? I do not know.&#x2014;When first that letter was delivered to you, was there any blotting on the name of R. B. Sheridan? I cannot say whether there was or not.&#x2014;Was there any blotting upon the name there, after you came to town? That I cannot answer. When I was served with a warrant I took and locked it in a trunk of mine in the same piece of paper it is in now, and I took it and kept it at home, and never had it out of doors since.&#x2014;Do you mean to say you cannot tell whether that blot on the name of R. B. Sheridan took place before or after you
<image src="S1V0009P0I0042"/>
<col>53</col>
came to town? I do mean to say so, do not know.&#x2014;Do you mean to say that blot did not arise from ink thrown upon it by Mr. S. in your presence? I cannot say that, because I know nothing at all about it.&#x2014;Did not you deliver that letter after you came to town into the hands of Mr. S.? Not our of my sight.&#x2014;Did you deliver it into his hands? I let him have it into his hand, and take out a copy of it.&#x2014;Was there an ink-stand near, when he had it? It was in my sight, and if any person had touched it I should have seen it; I saw no person touch it.&#x2014;Will you venture to swear, that at the time you delivered it to Mr. S. the blot was on his name? I cannot say any thing about that, for I took no notice of it.&#x2014;Had not you been in the habit of using that letter day by day at Portsmouth, for above 2 ,months before you came to town? No.&#x2014;Where were you when you Were served with the Speaker's summons to attend before the committee? In Mr. Boswell's house at Gosport.&#x2014;You have stated that Mr. Boswell asked you if you wanted money? Yes.&#x2014;What did he ask you if you wanted money for? I do not know; he asked me if I would let him have the letter for 24 hours, that he would give me bank-security if I would, 10 or 20l. That I can bring proof of by respectable persons, Mr. Joseph of Gosport.&#x2014;Was the bank-security for the return of the letter, or for his not keeping it beyond the 24 hours? I would not let him have it on any conditions.&#x2014;What did he offer you bank-security for? For returning the letter.&#x2014;You have stated the names of different persons whose letters you have seen used? I have not seen them; I have heard of their being used.&#x2014;You have stated that you went to the magistrate voluntarily to give your evidence; at whose desire did you go? My own, because I wanted to have it advertised in the paper; I was not satisfied with having a forgery in my possession.&#x2014;When was that? I have marked the date upon the letter, it is the 9th of Feb.&#x2014;The letter, I think, you stated to be dated the 3d of Nov.? Yes.&#x2014;When did you first discover it was a forgery, and think it necessary to go and make your complaint to the magistrate? When I was told of it.&#x2014;When was that? When I applied to Mr. S.&#x2014;When did you first apply to Mr. S.? When I first came to town, the 5th Feb. that night.&#x2014;Had you not been using that letter for the purpose of selling your slops, till you saw Mr. S. on the 5th Feb. at night? I had not, because I locked it up, and would
<col>54</col>
not make any use of it, after I was served with the Speaker's, warrant. I had been in the habit of delivering letters into men of war, where they have taken them, and torn them, and thrown them overboard, and I was afraid of their serving this letter the same.&#x2014;When were you served with the Speaker's warrant? The 12th Jan. is the date here; I cannot exactly state whether that was the day.&#x2014;I believe it was the 20th? It might be.&#x2014;Did you ever suggest to Mr. S. any doubt of the signature till you had been served with the Speaker's warrant? I never applied to Mr. S. till the 5th of Feb. and then he told me so; and I said it was better to advertise Mr. Drake if I could not find him.&#x2014;How came you not to apply to Mr. S. if you thought this a forgery, till you were served with the Speaker's warrant? I did not think it was a forgery till the 5th of Feb.&#x2014;Who told you so then? Mr. S.&#x2014;How came you to go to Mr. S. to ask him about it? Because I was served with the Speaker's warrant; and these people applying to me for the letter, I went and asked him whether I might give it up or not.&#x2014;When Mr. Boswell served you with the Speaker's ,warrant, did he not tell you that you were to be called to support the petition of Mr. Paull? He told me I was to apply to the house of commons on the 24th of Feb.; and he asked me if I had not a letter in my possession, signed by R. B. Sheridan, Treasurer of the Navy, I said, yes; and he said, would I let him look at it? I Said, I had no objection. He asked whether I would let him take a copy, and I did.&#x2014;Did not you know, from Mr. Boswell, that it was on the behalf of Mr. Paull that you were summoned? Yes.&#x2014;How came you to go to Mr. S.? Because, several times they applied to me for the letter, and that was the only reason I went to Mr. S. I live at Portsea, and Mr. Boswell at Gosport; and every now and then they sent over to me, and asked me for the letter. I did not think it proper to give it them; I told them I should go up to town, and have advice upon it: I would not act upon my own opinion.&#x2014;When were those applications first made to you by those persons? Several times after I was served with the precept.</p>

I said, if he could get me a letter from an admiral; I did not know any thing of Mr. S.&#x2014;You have stated that you were present when Mr. S. took a copy of this letter; who was present besides you? Mr. Johnston was in the room.&#x2014;Did you not think the name of the person who fills the office of treasurer of the navy, would have a better effect signed to his letter, than even the name of an admiral? I do not know.&#x2014;What use did you intend to make of that letter? For an introduction.&#x2014;How was the introduction to be procured?. When I have got a letter of this sort in my possession, and I go alongside a ship, I hand it up the side, saying, I have a letter for the commanding officer and they look at it if they please to take it into the ship; then if they please or not to admit the person who has the letter.&#x2014;Would you not prefer a letter from sir Isaac Coffin, to a letter from the treasurer of the navy?

His brother, whenever he came to town, logged at my house; and whenever he came he asked for his brother, and he has often sent for him; he is a poor unfortunate person; he was born in the year 1760; here is his age.&#x2014;What is your opinion of Mr. Weatherhead, and would you believe his testimony on oath? I could not believe his .testimony at all; he is a man of very bad character; he used to go out and be torn all to pieces, and his brother was quite ashamed of him.&#x2014;Is he of that reputation you would not believe him upon his oath? I would not believe him for a farthing, upon his oath.&#x2014;With what company has he associated? The last time he was in my house, he was in company with Robertson, who was hung lately; that was a few clays before Robertson was taken up; I never saw him till this evening and then he went away the moment he saw me.&#x2014;Was he acquainted with a person of the name of Bazeley?

<p><member>Mr. Paull</member> <membercontribution>was examined respecting some letters said to have passed between him and B. Hart. He acknowledged the hand-writing, and was proceeding to offer some observations upon the question to the house, when he was reminded by the Speaker of the capacity in which he then stood at the bar of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. B Hart</member> <membercontribution>was next examined. He had been employed by Mr. Paull during the election; he did not, however, consider himself as Mr. Paull's agent. Mr. Paull called at his house and left his card: he called a second time, and requested him to come to his house, Charles-street, St. James's-square, which he did, when Mr. Paull entreated him to exert his influence to procure him votes. About a week after the election he had some conversation with Mr. Paull and Mr. Powell respecting some suspicions that had gone abroad about bad votes said to have been given to Mr. Sheridan, and they recommended to him to endeavour to procure information respecting that matter; he however soon after fell ill, in which state he continued some weeks, and had not seen Mr. Paull since.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>was proceeding to ask the witness several more questions respecting his employment during the election, whether he did accompany Mr. Paull in his carriage to and from the hustings, &amp;c. &amp;c., when </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>observed, that his hon. friend, according to his own principle laid down on a former occasion, thought it best not to touch upon the general conduct of the election, but merely upon the allegations contained in the petition.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that such was the object he had in view; but he thought it necessary, at the same time, to ascertain the characters of the persons who were made the instruments to attempt to prove these allegations, and carry on one of the foulest conspiracies that the malignity of man had ever conceived.&#x2014;The examination and testimony of the last witness was then ordered to be expunged from the minutes taken at he bar, on the ground that it entered too
<image src="S1V0009P0I0044"/>
<col>57</col>
much into the merits of the petition to be entertained by the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>observed, that, if the house should deem it necessary to adapt any further proceedings relative to what was disclosed at their bar, there were several other witnesses in readiness, whom, perhaps, it might be thought necessary to call in, as they might possibly corroborate many of the particulars which had fallen from the other witnesses, or fill up some trifling chasms in the evidence; for his own part, however, he did not mean to trouble the house with any farther evidence, but was perfectly satisfied to let his case rest where it was. The papers which had been moved for that night, by a noble lord (Howick), world be sufficient to shew that there was not a word of truth in what had been said by Drake and another, who was thought to be a principal witness on the part of the petitioner.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>declared his firm conviction, that a foul and scandalous conspiracy had been entered into against the sitting member; and in order that the house might have an opportunity of judging more precisely as to the quality of the .evidence which had been adduced at their bar, he moved that the evidence be printed, which was ordered accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>observed, that it might be neceesary to take some measure to secure the future attendance of the witnesses at the bar, in case the house should think fit to take any further steps relative to the nature of the evidence which they had heard,&#x2014;The house then ordered, that the further proceeding on the Westminster petition and evidence should be resumed on Friday the 15th instant, and that the witnesses should attend on that day.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>thought it but justice to Mr. Cobbett to state, before the rising of the house, that notwithstanding What Drake had asserted, he was fully satisfied that he was entirely unconnected with the scandalous proceedings which had been taken against him.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. Hobhouse</member>, <membercontribution>chairman of the committee appointed to try the merits of the Wick election, reported, that the sitting member, Mr. Mackenzie, was duly elected, and that the petition of Sir John Sinclair against him was not frivolous nor vexatious.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[CONDUCT OF MR. CAWTHORNE.] Colonel Wilder</member>, <membercontribution>seeing an hon. general in his
<col>58</col>
place, wished to know from him whether it was his intention to bring forward the motion, of which he had given notice, for the expulsion of a member not now present (Mr. Cawthorne). It was painful to the hon. member, who was the object of that motion, that the matter should remain longer in suspense. It was also desirable to the house that the question should be brought to a decision as soon as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Porter</member> <member>said, that no man was a more anxious than he that this matter should be brought to a speedy decision, which must be equally desirable to the house and the gentleman who was the object of the motion. But the house having thought fit to appoint a committee to inquire into precedents relating to expulsion, he could not possibly proceed till that committee should have made its report, That report being now before the house, it was his intention this day, if the chairman of tho committee alluded to had been present, to fix a day as early as consistent with the convenience of that hon. gent., and that of the house. He would now merely state, that be intended on Monday to fix as early a day as possible, consistent with these objects.</member></p>
<p><member>[CALL OF THE HOUSE.]</member> <membercontribution>The names of The defaulters at the ballot for the Guilford election committee, on Thursday, were called over, and those who had no excuse to offer, were ordered to attend in their places on Tuesday, and in the event of there being absent without excuse on that day, to be taken into the custody of the serjeant at arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>took occasion here to say, that he did not look upon what was stated from any particular side of the house on cases of this kind to be the law. He should take the liberty of exercising his own judgment on every individual ease till the house should have pronounced upon it. On the occasion on he had been a defaulter, he had been in attendance at the bar of the house of lords, in the discharge of his professional duty. It was not for him to say whether that would be, in the sense of the house, an excuse; but he wished to know from the sense of the house whether his absence was criminal in such cases. He was unwilling to depend on what might be the sense of one side of the house or of any individual.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>stated, that it was the law of the house, that defaulters should be taken into custody. The order now made was but a notice that this law would be enforced.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0045"/>
<col>59</col>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>said, that this proceeding of taking defaulters into custody was, as had been stated from the chair, the law of the house. But it was open to the house to exercise its judgment on every individual case, and either to enforce the law, or dispense with its enforcement, upon sufficient excuse, or at its pleasure. But it was to be understood that, generally, it would be enforced, and that was the reason for making it a particular order on every particular occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SLAVE TRADE ABOLITION BILL]</member>. <membercontribution>The house, on the motion of lord Howick, resolved itself into a committee on the Slave Trade Abolition bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Charles Pole</member> <membercontribution>opposed the measure, not, he observed, with a view to the consideration of any individual interests, but as an object of the utmost national importance. About the year 1780, there were 15,000 persons destroyed by a hurricane in Jamaica; in case of such an event taking place again, it would be found impossible to uphold the state of property in the islands, without importation. On the other hand, if the trade was not permitted by parliament to be continued, it would be found almost impossible to prevent smuggling; or even if we did compleatly abandon the trade, it would be immediately taken up by the enemy, who would increase and strengthen his navy by those means, and we might soon expect to see the downfall of the British empire. At least he thought it might be expedient to give the planters time to add to their number of female slaves, as a probable means of laying the foundation for a better supply in future. He therefore moved, that instead of May, 1807, the words May, 1812, should be inserted, as the time for the commencement of the operation of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ward</member> <membercontribution>contended that our colonies would neither be injured nor ruined by the operation of the immediate abolition, but that on the contrary they would be benefited thereby. The disproportion between births and deaths had been for several Years declining in Jamaica. And the beneficial operation of this measure would leave the effect of reducing that disproportion still more. Besides, the population would be kept up by the kind treatment, which it would then be the interest of the planters to extend to their negroes. He should prefer the rejection of the whole measure to voting for the extension of its commencement for five years, which would be only a com-
<col>60</col>
promise of their consciences, and a disappointment of the wishes of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Philip Francis</member> <membercontribution>argued in favour of the bill. He maintained, that the abolition, so far from being injurous to the navy of this country, would be advantageous to our maritime strength, by preserving our seamen from the mortality which took place in the prosecution of that trade. If it were to be only a question respecting the navy of this country and the navy of France, he should not have any objection that the whole of the French navy should be employed in that trade; and he was convinced that our navy would maintain its superiority, while that of the enemy would be reduced still lower than it was at present. Nothing tended so much to the calamities that had ruined St. Domingo, as the unlimited power that individuals had of increasing the disproportion between the black and the white population. This bill would extinguish that power, and, therefore, secure the tranquillity of the British colonies.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>would be extremely glad to hear by what regulations the hon. member's father (Mr. Ward) kept up the population on his estate in Jamaica, and there could not be the smallest doubt of all the other planters being extremely obliged to him, and most cheerfully following his example; He had heard something of its local situation, preventing the negroes from mixing with those on the estates adjoining; their habits were different, and that might in some measure account for the difference in the maintenance of the population on that particular estate. He cautioned gentlemen, however, against being led away by false notions of popularity and humanity. Those who were planter themselves might easily raise a clamour against the cruelty of the planters, &amp;c., but he would have gentlemen to recollect that the West Indies had been the support of the country for many years, both as to seamen and revenue. We might as well say, Oh, we will not have our chimney swept, because it is a little troublesome to the boy, as that we should give up the benefit of the West Indies on account of the supposed hardships of the negro.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Vyse</member> <membercontribution>vindicated the character of the planters for humanity; but supported the bill most strenuously, on the ground that there was a most shameful abuse of the authority delegated by them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>observed. that if the mea-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0046"/>
<col>61</col>
sure of French iniquity was not yet full, we should surrender up to them this guilty trade, that we might acquit ourselves of any further charge as to this heinous offence; whilst it might complete the catalogue of our enemies' crimes, we, at the same time, might hope to have taken one great step towards averting the wrath of Heaven from us.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Addington</member> <membercontribution>supported the amendment; but at the same time recommended that a parliamentary commission should be sent out to every island in the West Indies, and that parliament might afterwards lay very high duties on the importation of slaves into every island where the traffic was found to be still carried on.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>thought it would be a most tedious and impotent measure to wait until we had the report of as many of the commissioners as might chance to reach home with the report, and then leave the measure in a great degree to the discretion of the governors of the different islands. But there was one point which he thought to be particularly worthy of notice; the council for the planters had acknowledged at the bar of the house of lords, that it was intended to have several new pieces of land cultivated, for which a fresh supply of slaves was wanted; and there was another point to which he thought it necessary to advert; did the gallant admiral opposite suppose that we, as christians, could hope, when visited by the wrath of Heaven, as he had stated, with a hurricane, could we then hope for a blessing from the Almighty by setting off to Africa to rob and murder in order to recruit our stock?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>entered into a detail of the various proceedings of parliament, and the opinion of the most eminent public men for a century past as to this trade. He concluded by observing, that his late right hon. friend (Mr Pitt) was in his heart a most sincere abolitionist, as well as himself, though there was some difference of opinion between them as to the best means of carrying that principle into execution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>opposed any further delay; he contended that the authorities cited by the right hon. gent. were not conclusive; on speculative truths the most clear and in-Controvertible, there had been in all ages men of probity and wisdom who had their own peculiar and exclusive sentiments. In the parliaments of France how long was it a subject of discussion, whether torture should be sanctioned or not? And yet could there
<col>62</col>
be at this day found a man in civilized Europe who would profess hinself an advocate of torture?&#x2014;so would it be with the slave trade. As to the necessity of delaying its abolition, what had been said? They set out, said the noble lord, with the proposition that the slave trade is inhuman and unjust, and then they propose to prolong that system of injustice, and continue five years more the practice of that inhumanity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Canning</member> <membercontribution>took a view of the subject in three different relations, with respect to Africa, the slave merchants, and the slaves themselves; the arguments advanced by the hon. baronet (sir C. Pole) appeared to him to have been completely overturned by the statement of facts advanced by the gallant general in support of them; he was decidedly for the most speedy abolition of so disgraceful a traffic.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst </member> <membercontribution>thought the immediate abolition of the trade imposible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>was of a contrary opinion, and thought that the measure, to be effectual, must be speedy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>warmly contended for the necessity of immediate abolition.&#x2014;The question being loudly called for, the committee divided.

<p><member>[MUTINY BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The house, on the motion of the Secretary at War, having gone into a committee on the Mutiny bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War</member> <membercontribution>made a few observations on the momentous object of the bill, which went to preserve the civil power from all possibility of military encroachment; he then read some of the clauses which he wished to have made part of the bill. Officers or soldiers charged with capital offences, to be turned over to the civil magistrate; but no officer to be ipso facto cashiered for not aiding the civil power, until convicted of such charge before a court of justice. Another clause was introduced and agreed to, enacting that a mark shall be fixed on the bodies of deserters who have been twice guilty of desertion. Another clause compelled deserters to serve for life, and made such forfeit additional pay and pension. A further clause required that no person should be sentenced to the loss of life or limb, or to transportation, by a general court martial, consisting of less than thirteen officers. The clause relative to the enlisting money, as also that providing compensation for masters whose servants or labourers may have enlisted before the time contracted for had expired, gave rise to a short conversation between Mr. R. Dundas, sir T. Turton, colonel Barry, Mr. Rose and Mr. Secretary Windham, when, after a slight amendment of the latter, both were agreed to. The remaining clauses, including one declaring all negroes in his majesty's service free to all intents and purposes, were then severally read and agreed to, and, on the house resuming, the report was ordered to be received the next day.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SLAVE TRADE ABOLITION BILL.] Mr. Hobhouse</member> <membercontribution>brought up the report of the Slave Trade Abolition bill. On the motion that the amendments be read a second time,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick rose</member> <membercontribution>and said, that before the amendments were read, he was anxious to advert to what had passed on a former occasion, and propose, what he flattered himself would be sufficient to obviate certain objections; in doing this, however, he begged to be understood as not in the slightest degree swerving from the opinions he had advanced, and still entertained, of the principles of the bill itself. He wished to give gentlemen, who had started their objections, every possible accommodation;
<col>64</col>
and though he could not see how the preamble of the bill in its present form could be productive of the ill consequences that had been so strongly apprehended, yet he would consent, by omitting the two first lines, to put that preamble in a form less objectionable. At the same time, when he recollected that all the former proceedings of the two houses of parliament, relative to the slave trade, had been published in all parts of the West Indies, and there circulated, and especially the very resolution declaring the trade to be inconsistent with justice, humanity and sound policy, and that those publications were not productive of any disturbance or disaffection among the negroes; he could not think that if the preamble stood in its original state, it could be productive of the least evil; this opinion, however, should yield to his anxiety for general accommodation on a great question like the present. The amended form of the preamble then proposed by the noble lord, excluded the terms "founded in humanity, &amp;c." and substituted, for certain special reasons, "it is expedient that the slave trade be abolished."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert</member> <membercontribution>said he should reserve what he had to say for a future stage of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Vyse</member> <membercontribution>contended that the terms used in the first preamble, were but characterestic of so infamous a trade, and represented the miseries of the wretched victims in a three fold point of view, the circumstances of their capture and sale in Africa, those of their passage to the colonies, and the manner of their reception on their arrival there.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>thought, that the wording of the preamble as it originally stood, would have been productive of dangerous consequences among the slaves.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>could not see it in so alarming a point of view, but had no objection to the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>felt himself much obliged to the noble lord for the Willingness he had evinced towards general accommodation on this subject; he could not however help adverting to the unfair and unhandsome construction that had been put upon his own conduct in this business; he did not much like to see upon a former night an hon. member going about the house asking questions about his estate in the colonies, the name of it, and other circumstances, as if it were to detect him (Mr. Fuller) in any assertion that might not
<image src="S1V0009P0I0048"/>
<col>65</col>
not be strictly consonant to the fact; he should scorn to assert any thing which he did not think he could substantiate. He knew what was due from every member to that house, and he knew also what was due from a man of honour to himself. He was no pitiful canter;&#x2014;confident in the integrity of his intentions, no superstitious folly hurried him to interpret every little casualty into a dire visitation of Providence. But had he no internal principle to guide him, he had to support that character, a long line of ancestry bequeathed him. The family were well known and respected in 1607, and this was 1807, and they were now, as they were then&#x2014;not one of them indebted to any faction or to any ministry for sixpence of the public money; they were then in prosperity, and now in the fairest way of prospering, it gentlemen would let them prosper. As for himself, he had always voted in that house as a juror upon his oath. He was not endeavouring to get in with the government,&#x2014;he felt and acted as an independent man, and was never an admirer of affected piety.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>approved of the amendment in the preamble proposed by the noble lord (Howick) on principles of policy. The impressing upon the minds of the negroes that it was by a violation of the laws of justice and humanity that they came there, would be only filling their minds with unavailing regret. He acknowledged that the circulation of the papers respecting the abolition in the West Indies, was rather a singular sort of proceeding. But, at the same time, the negroes must have learnt from these that the sentiments concerning the inhumanity, injustice, &amp;c. of the measure were only those of the minority in this country. He recommended conciliatory measures, and observed, that whatever bad effects might result from the mode of proceeding in this business, he had nothing to do with them. He disapproved of the trade itself, but had objections to the manner of abolishing it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dickenson</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the opinions which he formerly maintained on this subject were much weakened; still, however, doubted the policy of the measure, but at the same time could not help paying his tribute of approbation to the moderation of the noble lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Gascoyne</member> <membercontribution>also approved of the amendment; but still contended that the measure would in the first instance occasion a separation of interests and opinions between this country and the colonies, and ultimately occasion an entire separation, unless the
<col>66</col>
law passed in 1807 should be repealed in 1808.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>proposed a clause to prevent the late regulations for limited service extending to the negroes. The negroes, therefore, are still to be inlisted in the first instance, his Majesty having the power to make such regulations respecting them as he may hereafter judge proper. The object of this was to prevent any apprehensions of their becoming chargeable to the islands. This clause was received and added to the bill.&#x2014;The amendment in the preamble, and the amendments in the committee were then agreed to, and the bill was ordered to be read a third time on Wednesday.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<date format="1807-03-10">Tuesday, March 10.</date>
<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.]&#x2014;Lord Grenville rose</member> <membercontribution>to move for certain accounts, previous to the introduction of the subject, for the consideration of which their lordships were then particularly summoned. He had, on a former occasion, when he proposed to the house his intention of bringing in a bill for the regulation of the Courts of Justice in Scotland, adverted to the great inconvenience which the house had already suffered, and which it was likely yet to suffer, in consequence of the great number of appeal causes submitted to its judicial consideration. He should therefore at present trouble their lordships with two motions; first, that an account be presented to the house of the number of Scotch Appeals, from the year 1794 to 1801; and next; an Account of the number of Scotch and Irish Appeals, from 1801 to the present year 1807.&#x2014;Ordered accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>having quitted the woolsack, observed, that he was induced to call the attention of their lordships to a communication made to him from the president and senators of the College of Justice in Scotland, for the purpose of being guided by the wisdom and decision of the house, on a subject in which he was unwilling to trust to his own private judgment and opinion. He had received from that body a memorial, adverting to the bill at present before the house, for the better regulation of the Courts of Justice in Scotland; but, as it contained no distinct prayer, nor complained of any specific grievance, he did not feel himself justified by any precedent in the Parliamentary History of the country, to present it to their lordships. He found, from a reference to a marginal note in the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0049"/>
<col>67</col>
memorial, that the Court of Session grounded the present communication on two precedents; the first, when, in the year 1659, the Court of Session made an application in a similar manner to the parliament of Scotland.; and the other, that, in the year 1717, by the Act of Sederunt, the Court of Session did apply to certain lords, part of their own body, but who were also lords of parliament, communicating to them their opinion on certain legislative measures then in the consideration of the house. It was for the house to determine whether such precedent had any reference to the present case. Anxious as he was to obtain the instructions and opinion of so learned and venerable a body as the Court of Session, and naturally alive to the feelings and wishes of his native country, he still could not forget that he had to preserve the rights and privileges, the dignity and character, of the house. With such an impression, and in so delicate and important a matter, he felt it the most advisable method to govern himself by the wisdom and judgment of their lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>declared himself particularly satisfied with the motives and reasons which had induced his noble and learned friend to apply to their lordships for advice and instruction in the present case. But, though willing to give every credit for the caution which was observe, he still must assert, that the usages and forms of parliament, the practice and precedents of the house, were conclusive against the receiving of this memorial from the Court of Session. Parliament had uniformly, for the best and most salutary reasons, denied to any person or body, the right or opportunity of giving advice upon subjects submitted to its legislative consideration. This was of itself mandatory on their lordships, not to receive the communication alluded to by his noble and learned friend. But there was a further objection, arising from the uniform custom of the house, not to allow even petitions to be laid upon its table, coming from any alleged body, unless that body were legally and justifiably entitled to approach the legislature in a corporate capacity. He was convinced his noble and learned friend felt upon this subject, as he did; although he was conscious of the strong and powerful inducements which urged him to apply to their lordships. There was considerable attention to be paid to the venerable and learned body from whom this communication was received. This his noble and learned friend
<col>68</col>
felt, together with an unwillingness to decide a question of such weighty importance on his own private opinion and conviction. With respect to the precedents referred to in the memorial, they would be found, on examination, by no means to apply to the present case. Whatever might be the nature of the connexion of the Court of Session, with the parliament of Scotland, one fact was clear, that no inference could be drawn from that circumstance, in any manner affecting the practice or decision of the house. It was unnecessary to enter into the minute differences: he should satisfy himself by saying, that the parliament of this country was so essentially different in its construction from the parliament of Scotland, that no act of the latter could be supposed as a justified precedent, by which the house should regulate itself. But the reference to the act of Sederunt, in the year 1717, when an application was made by the Court of Session, to lords of parliament, was, in his opinion, equally inapplicable to the present case; because it appeared, from an examination of that precedent, that the lords of the Court of Session applied only in the manner of remonstrance, to some lords who constituted a part of their court, and also fulfilled the duties of lords of parliament. He felt it impossible for the house to receive the memorial; at the same time that he was free to admit, that the house might receive much desirable information from having the opinion of that learned body laid before it. It was in their power to avail themselves of the right of petitioning according to the sanctioned and acknowledged principles of parliament. For his own part, he was extremely anxious to have the house put in possession of the opinion of that venerable court. From some of the suggestions of the memorial (for he had also been honoured with a copy of it from the lord president) he had received important information; on other points, he was still obliged to dissent. As far, therefore, as he was personally concerned, he wished their lordships to be enabled, from learning the objections of the Court of Session, to appreciate the value of those arguments, which he should think it his duty to state, in answer to such objections. He recommended his noble and learned friend to state, in his wonted respectful manner, to the learned person from whom he received the memorial, the insuperable objections which prevented him from presenting it to the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Eldon</member> <membercontribution>was of opinion, that although
<image src="S1V0009P0I0050"/>
<col>69</col>
the house could not receive a communication from the Court of Session, in the manner in which the present memorial was made, yet it was of the highest importance, that the opinion and advice of so learned and venerable a body, on a subject which so peculiarly involved their interests and duties, should be fully in possession of their lordships, before they were called upon to decide on perhaps one of the greatest changes which ever took place in the administration of justice in any country. There were other modes, whereby that instruction and information could be obtained. For instance, it was in the power of the house to resolve, that the measure should be submitted to the opinion of the Court of Session, for the purpose of enabling it to gain beneficial information from the report which should be made. There were precedents for such a line of procedure, and it was for their lordships to adopt that which tended to promote the means of acquiring the most correct knowledge of the merits of the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>expressed himself as anxious as any other noble lord, to have the opinion of the Court of Session laid before the house: but, at the same time, he wished to be fully understood, that in order to prevent any Farther delay in receiving such opinion, the lords of the Court of Session should petition the house in their individual capacity, for only in that capacity could their petition be received, With respect to one of the precedents referred to, it would be found by the preamble of the Bill on the Forfeited Estates, that the lords of the Court of Session were only heard as petitioners, or, as the bill more appropriately recited, as supplicants. He deprecated the proposal of consulting the lords of Session on the enactment of a legislative measure; such conduct would be inconsistent with the character and forms of parliament; it was a principle which the house never did nor could recognise. By the 10th of George I. parliament deprived the Court of Session of the right of interfering in the appointment of the judges, yet the house did not conceive it necessary to apply for information to the lords of the Court of Session, Indeed, in all cases where the history of parliament afforded an opportunity of inquiry, whether applicable to England or Scotland, he contended, that, however parliament might have deemed it necessary to apply to the judges for their opinions on points of law, it never did commit to their investigation a legislative mea-
<col>70</col>
sure, in the agitation of which it then happened to be engaged.&#x2014;After some further observations,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <member>said, that he would take upon himself to make the necessary communication to the learned lord from whom he received the memorial, without in any manner committing the house, or compromising its privileges or character.</member></p>

<p><member>[PETITION OF MR. COCHRANE JOHN-STONE.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>stated, that he held in his hand a Petition from the hon, Andrew Cochrane Johnston, late colonel of the 8th West India Regiment, and governor of the Island of Dominica. Before he opened the subject of it, he thought it proper to explain to the house, that he had not the honour of the petitioner's acquaintance. He never saw him until yesterday, when he had a few minutes conversation with him. The petition, he understood, had been offered to several members who had declined presenting it. In conformity with a principle which he had laid down for himself, he thought it his duty to present it, at the same time he begged to be understood as not being in the smallest degree pledged to the truth of the allegations contained in it.<lb/>
The Petition was then presented and read. It stated, "That the petitioner, previous to the month of October, 1803, had served as an officer in the army, upwards of twenty years; that-he had risen in regular gradation, from the rank of ensign to that of colonel; that of his time of service, thirteen years had been spent upon foreign stations, frequently under circumstances of great fatigue and danger; and, that, during the whole of the said service, he had never, upon any occasion, incurred the censure or displeasure of any one of his superiors, but had generally the satisfaction to meet with
<image src="S1V0009P0I0051"/>
<col>71</col>
their marked approbation. That brevet promotions in the army are made according to seniority of rank, and that for an officer to be passed over in such promotion is a deep disgrace to him. That, in the afore said month of October, 1803, a brevet promotion of major-generals took place, in which promotion the name of your petitioner was purposely omitted. That, sensible of the disgrace thus inflicted on him, and conscious that the infliction was unjust, he immediately applied to His Royal Highness the Duke of York, then and now commander-in-chief of his Majesty's forces, to know the cause of punishment so severe and unexpected. That it was upwards of two months before he received any answer that all to this application, and that he Was then informed of the cause of his punishment, by a letter from the Duke of York, dated on the 10th of December, 1803, containing the following words:&#x2014; "It is an invariable rule of the service, not to include in any general brevet promotion, an officer (whatever may be his rank) against whom their exist charges, the merit of which has not been decided; but, whenever an investigation shall have taken place, and, should the result prove favourable to you, there will not be any difficulty in your recovering the rank, to which your seniority, as colonel, entitles you." That it was with great surprise, that your petitioner thus, for the first time, learnt, that there were charges <i>existing</i> against him; and, it was not without some degree of indignation, that he perceived, that he had been punished upon the ground of mere charges preferred in the dark; that these charges had never been communicated to him, and, moreover, that, even of the <i>existence</i> of which charges he was not informed, until upwards of two months after he had been <i>punished</i>, and had complained of his punishment. That your petitioner, upon receiving the letter aforesaid from the Duke of York, lost no time in most earnestly soliciting his Royal Highness to afford him information as to the nature and purport of the charges <i>existing</i> against him; but, that, unto his repeated entreaties for this purpose, no answer whatever was he able to obtain, until the 28th day of the ensuing month of May, when, after having been thus kept in a state of suspense and disgrace for six months, he was informed, by order of the Duke of York, that he, the Duke of York, had now called upon Major Gordon (the accuser) to state whether he meant to bring forward any charges at all
<col>72</col>
against your petitioner; so that, as your honourable house will perceive, your petitioner was now, informed, not of the nature of the charges against him, but that the Duke of York had not yet ascertained whether there were in existence the grounds whereon to form any such charges, though, as it will be perceived by your honourable house, your petitioner had actually been <i>punished</i>, upon the ground, as stated by the Duke of York himself, that charges existed against your petitioner in the preceding month of October. That your petitioner, conscious, that no criminal charge could, with truth, be preferred against him, impatiently waited for the day of trial, which, however, to the great vexation and injury of your petitioner, was delayed until the month of March, 1805, though, according to the Duke of York's letter of the 10th of December, 1803, the charges actually existed against your petitioner in the month of October preceding,&#x2014;a year and a half before it was thought proper to proceed upon them. That previous, however, to the assembling of the court martial, before whom your petitioner was sent, stigmatized with having now been passed over in two general brevet promotions, some circumstances occurred, to which your petitioner humbly presumes to solicit the particular attention of your honourable house. That your petitioner having stated to Sir Charles Morgan, the then judge advocate general, his objection to Mr. Oldham as a person to officiate as judge advocate at the approaching trial, and which objection was founded upon the partial conduct of Mr. Oldham upon a recent occasion, Sir Charles Morgan informed your petitioner, that, in consequence of such objection, he had had an intention of appointing some other person to officiate at the court martial: but that he had recently received an application from His Royal Highness the Duke of York, specially requesting, that Mr. Oldham might officiate; and that this had determined him (Sir Charles Morgan) to employ Mr. Oldham upon the occasion. That your petitioner, at no loss as to the motive of this interference, adhered the more resolutely to his aforesaid objection; but that, though he, finally, and with much difficulty, succeeded in this point, he, to his great mortification, found, that, immediately afterwards, the seat of the court martial, which was, by the order of the Duke of York, actually assembling at Canterbury, whither, towards the end of February, your petitioner and several of his witnesses had repaired, was, all of a sudden,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0052"/>
<col>73</col>
removed to Chelsea, notwithstanding the remonstrance of your petitioner, who, in letter to the judge advocate general, dated on the 21st of February, 1805, stated, that "great inconvenience and expence would be occasioned by this change, as well as the impossibility of transmitting timely notice of it to the witnesses, particularly those resident in distant parts of the kingdom." That, in spite of all the disadvantages, by these and other means created, your petitioner was honourably acquitted upon all the charges preferred against him, notwithstanding so much study and preparation had been used in the producing of those charges; that, not only was he so acquitted, but there was not brought out in evidence, one single fact tending in the slightest degree to shew, that the accuser himself could possibly ever have believed any one of the charges to be true; and that it was glaringly evident, that the whole of the accusation consisted of falsehoods invented for the sole purpose of injuring the fame and the fortune of your petitioner, and of giving the colour of justice to the punishment which had already been inflicted upon him. That your petitioner, upon the result of the trial being made known unto him, did, on the 18th of April, 1805, endeavour to obtain an audience of his royal highness the duke of York, in order to obtain, in the list of major-generals, that place to which his seniority entitled him, and in the obtaining of which he had, by his royal highness, been informed, there would be "<i>no difficulty, provided the result of the court martial was favourable to him</i>." That your petitioner, having been refused access to the duke of York in the first instance, having been unable by other means to obtain any satisfactory answer to his repeated applications, tendered the resignation of his commission as colonel, resolved no longer to remain in a service, in which he was so unjustly held in a state of degradation. That, as to the grounds, upon which the application of your petitioner was rejected, your honourable house will have observed, that the decisions of all general courts martial are communicated to the king by the judge advocate general, who, when he has thereupon received the commands of the king, communicates them to the commander-in-chief, together with the king's remarks thereon. That, in pursuance of this practice, Sir Charles Morgan, having first laid the decision of the court martial aforesaid before the king, next communicated it to the duke of York, subjoining there
<col>74</col>
unto, as coming from the king himself, a remark, that, as to the principal charge, the court had been inhibited by Jaw from proceeding upon it, owing to the crime alledged having taken place more than three years previous to the date of the warrant for the trial, and that "his Majesty considered this lapse of time to have been owing to an improper conduct of the prosecutor." That as your honourable house will not fail to perceive, this remark was calculated to cause it to be believed, that, if no lapse of time had so taken place, and if the court martial had not thereby been inhibited from proceeding on the said charge, the said charge might have been established against your petitioner: whereas, the facts were; 1st, That the act charged, was alledged to have taken place previous to September 1801; 2d, That an investigation into the conduct of your petitioner was contemplated by the duke of York in October 1803, and upon that contemplation he withheld the name of your petitioner from the brevet promotion; 3d, That, between September 1801 and October 1803, only two years and one month had elapsed; 4th, That beween October 1803 and August 1804, when the warrant for the trial was, at last, issued, your petitioner did make urgent and repeated requests to the duke of York, that the trial might take place without delay; and 5th. That your petitioner, apprehensive that a plea of lapse of time might be made use of, for the purpose of leaving a blemish upon his reputation, expressly requested, in a letter to the adjutant general, dated on the 22d of June 1804, that "no part of the grounds, on which major Gordon had proposed to found, his charges, should be kept back from examination;" from which facts your petitioner is satisfied, that it will clearly appear to your honourable house, that if the court martial was inhibited from taking cognizance of the charge aforesaid, the inhibition was to be ascribed solely to those concerned in framing and bringing forward the prosecution. That, however, to the most important fact, connected with the aforesaid remark of the king, it remains for your petitioner to pray the attention of your honourable house; namely, that notwithstanding the lapse of time, the court martial actually did, before they perceived such lapse, fully investigate the merits of the said charge; that the charge was, by evidence the most complete, clearly proved to be utterly false, and destitute of the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0053"/>
<col>75</col>
semblance of foundation; and that it was not until <i>after such proof had been given</i>, I that the court martial discovered that they were, by law, inhibited from taking cognizance of it. That it was nevertheless, upon the ground of the remark made by the judge advocate general, in the king's name, that the duke of York, in a letter to your petitioner, dated on the 16th of May, 1805, refused to place your petitioner in that situation, as to rank, to which he was, by his seniority, entitled. That your petitioner, full of indignation at the injustice with which he had been treated, addressed a remonstrance to the judge advocate general, complaining of the aspersion cast upon his character by the putting of the remark aforesaid upon the records of the army, while, at the same time, the facts above stated by your petitioner were carefully concealed. That in answer to this remonstrance, the judge advocate general informed your petitioner, in a letter dated on the 26th April, 1805, that "<i>since he had communicated to the duke of York the letter in which the aforesaid remark was contained, he had seen occasion to recall that letter, and to substitute another in lieu thereof leaving out the said remark, and that he had taken upon, himself to explain to the king, the reason why this remark</i>" (made, as your honourable house will perceive, in the king's name, and as coming from the king himself) "<i>was now omitted</i>." That, thus, as it must be manifest to your honourable house, the judge advocate general has the power to communicate to the commander-in-chief remarks, in the king's name, upon the decision of every general court martial, from which remarks alone the commander-in-chief must according to his letter above mentioned addressed to your petitioner, "<i>form his opinion upon the whole matter of each case</i>;" that the judge advocate general has the further power of altering such remarks at his pleausure, not only without the orders, but even without the knowledge of the king, in whose name they are made; that this judge advocate general not only holds his office during pleasure, but is at the same time so much under the influence of the commander in chief, as to be induced, at his bare suggestion, to change his intention as to the person whom he shall employ to officiate in his stead at a court martial; and that, thus, the fame and fortune of all the officers of the army, (an establishment, the annual expence of which is now more than eighteen millions sterling)
<col>76</col>
amounting, in number, to several thousands of gentlemen, connected by ties of blood, or otherwise, with no small portion of the rank and consequence and influence, in the whole of the community, are subject to the absolute will of <i>one irresponsible individual.</i> That, from this cause, your petitioner has suffered most grievous injustice, indignity, and injury; that, after a life of faithful, zealous, and arduous services, be has been driven, as above shown, to the alternative of abandoning his profession and his means of subsistence, or of retaining them accompanied with unmerited disgrace; and, that he, therefore, prays your honourable house, the constitutional protectors of the people's liberties arid properties against arbitrary power and oppression, to afford him redress, and to prevent, by such means as the wisdom of your honourable house it shall seem meet, the future recurrence of similar grievances. And your petitioner shall ever pray. ANDREW COCHRANE JOHNSTONE. <i>London, March 2d</i>, 1807."&#x2014;The petition having been read, Mr. Whitbread moved, that it do lie on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War</member> <membercontribution>observed, that as there was no pledge to bring forward any motion on this petition, he would now take the opportunity of saying a few words, because it had been spread abroad that he had pledged himself to bring this matter before the house. He was glad of this opportunity of giving a public contradiction to that charge. Some gentlemen who had been in the late parliament, might recollect the notice which he had given: but, as many of the present parliament might not be acquainted with the proceeding, he would state the case exactly as it stood. He had observed, in the case of Mr. Johnstone, and in many others, what appeared to him to be an abusive practice in military justice. This arose from the nature of the powers of the judge advocate. It seemed to him a strange impropriety that the judge advocate, in these cases, should be the only person consulted when a decision was given by the king, and that there should be no consultation the commander in chief, the person intrusted by his Majesty with the management of the forces, and who ought properly to be responsible. He therefore gave notice of a proposition to put an end to that practice. Subsequent to that notice, a change took place in his Majesty's councils, and this afforded him the means of applying the remedy without having recourse to parliament; and he was happy to state, that having
<image src="S1V0009P0I0054"/>
<col>77</col>
made representations to his Majesty upon this Point, his Majesty had been graciously pleased to direct, that the proceedings should be conducted in future so as to answer the object Which he had in view from the beginning. The present practice, therefore, was, that the judge advocate did not receive his final decision on giving in his report, but that his Majesty afterwards signified his decision to the commander in chief, who was therefore responsible for the advice given to his Majesty on these occasions. Thus the injustice which was supposed to arise from the interference of the judge advocate was prevented. He would not object to receiving the petition, though he saw no advantage which could result to the petitioner from it. One of the objects of the petition was to obtain the restoration of his rank. This was a case in which the house could not in the least degree interfere. It was one on which it was impossible to frame any question which could procure the petitioner success. It would be an interference with the prerogative, which the house could not possibly sanction without extreme danger and inconvenience. Another object of the petition was, that the house should take such measures as might prevent the recurrence of such proceedings in future. It was unnecessary to petition the house on that particular point, as it had been already done. The judge advocate general was deprived of that power of which he had complained, and which he certainly would have made the subject of a motion, had not the Situation to which he was appointed afforded him an opportunity of putting an end to the practice. He begged pardon for trespassing on the house, but he thought it necessary to refute the idle and mischievous reports, the calumnies, he might say, which had been circulated respecting his conduct in this business.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. William Dundas</member> <membercontribution>could not subscribe to the doctrine of the hon gent. (Mr. Whitbread) that every petition was to be presented if couched in respectful terms. The petition had been put into his hands, and he had certainly declined presenting it, because he could nor conceive how this house could interfere so as to give the redress solicited.<lb/>
Mr. Whitbread</membercontribution> <membercontribution>declared, that he did not constitute himself judge to determine what petitions ought to be presented and what not. All that he had to do was to take care that they Were couched in proper and respectful terms. Whether they were to be received
<col>78</col>
or not was matter for the consideration of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plumer</member> stated, that he had also had the petition offered to him, but had declined presenting it for the same reason that had been stated by the right hon gent. (Mr. Dundas), as he united with him in thinking that it was the duty of every member to exercise his own judgment as to whether a petition ought to be presented or not?</p>
<p><member>Sir E.

He therefore rose merely for the purpose of seconding the motion which had been made.&#x2014;The motion was then put and carried.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. Frankland</member>,<membercontribution>chairman of the Yarmouth election committee, reported that the sitting members, Messrs. Harbord and Lushington, were duly elected, and that the petition against them was not frivolous or vexatious.&#x2014;On the motion of Mr. Tierney, it was ordered, that there be laid before the house a monthly return of desertions from the army, from the 1st of January to the latest period; also a return of the effective strength of the army, from which the said desertions had taken place at the same periods; also a weekly account of the number of recruits raised in the same period, distinguishing Ireland from Great Britain.&#x2014;On the motion of Mr. Kenrick, it was ordered, that there be laid before the house, an account of the number of causes tried by the court of exchequer in Scotland during the last 15 years.&#x2014;Mr. Herbert, after commenting briefly on the important question now before the house, touching the expulsion of one of its members, and observing that it was desirable, in addition to the report of the committee of precedents, to have every other information calculated to give a full and fair view of all parts of the case, moved, that the Proceedings of the Court Martial for the Trial of John Fenton Cawthorne, esq. colonel of the Westminster militia, laid before the house, April 8, 1796, and ordered to be printed, be now reprinted. Mr. Tierney objected to the motion on the ground of the expence, trouble, and delay of printing a voluminous mass of papers, when the question before the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0055"/>
<col>79</col>
house was not whether the expulsion had justly taken place, but whether the member expelled could legally sit again. Mr. Bankes thought the papers ought to be printed, in order to afford a full view of the case. Mr. Sturges Bourne, Mr. Hurst, Mr. Simeon, Mr. Osborne, and Mr. Fuller, argued to the same effect. Mr. C. Wynne wished this question to be reserved for future discussion. The Speaker thought it right to observe, that when this business had been first before the house, it had been thought right to print not only the sentence of the court martial, but the whole of the proceedings relating to the case. Upon which, it was ordered that the whole of the proceedings be reprinted.&#x2014;On the motion of lord Folkestone, it was ordered, that there be laid before the house copies of papers tending to shew in what capacity William Drake, the witness on Mr. Paull's petition, had served in the navy.&#x2014;Ordered, that the orders for reporting the names of members who do not appear on the appointment of select committees for trial of petitions complaining of undue elections and returns, do not extend to members who are petitioners, or petitioned against, during the trial of the respective petitions in which they are concerned, or to members serving on committees actually sitting.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[FREEHOLD ESTATES BILL.]</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;On the motion of the Solicitor General, the report of the Freehold Estates bill was brought up.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Col. Eyre warmly</member> <membercontribution>opposed the principle of the bill. He thought that it shewed much of the modern spirit of innovation; and that it would decrease the credit of the landed proprietor, to a very mischievous extent. The commercial man carried on speculations which tended to his own advantage, and the advantage of the public, and was not so likely, therefore, to be injured by this bill, while it would tend to the ruin of the man of landed property. It had been said, that the honest and considerate man would make all his debts burdens upon his estates; but in his opinion, the honest and considerate man Would act in such a manner as to render this bill totally unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr.Roscoe</member> <membercontribution>strenuously defended the principle of the bill; and thought the house was much indebted to the learned gent who had introduced it. As to its being an innovation, he begged to observe, that the effects of the measure proposed had been experienced every day, as it would do nothing more than make every real estate subject to a debt which every honest man would wish to see paid; and whether it was done by the act of
<col>82</col>
the testator, or by the act of the law, would make no great difference in regard to the alledged innovation. It was a crime of the highest magnitude to bequeath an estate to an heir, when a testator knew it to be greatly burdened. This, he thought, ought undoubtedly to be prevented by law from occurring. It might happen that a person of integrity and honesty, intending to make his estate liable for his debt, might, through negligence or other circumstances, be prevented from doing so. This bill would, therefore, tend to remedy these evils. Entailed estates were not to be affected, nor were copy hold estates. He hoped, however, to see this bill followed by another, to make landed property liable for specialty debts. As to this bill making an inroad upon the customs of our ancestors, that was no argument at all; as it was the very purpose for which the house met, to rectify the laws in every particular, however long they may have existed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>declared himself in favour of the bill, and did not apprehend those evil consequences would result from this measure, which the hon. gent. was of opinion would be the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. N. Calvert</member> <membercontribution>declared, he saw no sufficient ground for this innovation in the law; nor did he know, nor had he ever heard of any instances of landed proprietors availing themselves of the law as it now stood, in order to cheat their creditors. He was unwilling, without a clear case of necessity being made out, to remove the old legal land marks of the constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Martin</member> <membercontribution>assured the hon. gent. that instances had occurred, which pointed out the necessity of remedying the law, as it now stood. He particularly instanced the case of a person, a considerable land-owner, who had a number of natural children, for whom he wished to provide, who had made over his real estates to trustees, and to divide the produce amongst the children. The surviving trustee had sold the whole of the landed estate, and purchased others, without charging them with any provision for these children; in this state he died; and the family in question were left in a state of abject poverty. There were other instances of as crying a nature. The present measure was not an attempt to get rid of any legal institution, but rather to afford a remedy for an existing defect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor-General</member> <membercontribution>said, he did not wish to provoke a debate, in the present stage of the bill; at the same time, he could not but feel surprised at the consequences
<image src="S1V0009P0I0057"/>
<col>83</col>
imputed to this measure, the object of which was to compel justice to be done, by obliging the rich debtor to pay the poor creditor. He denied that this bill would have any injurious effect upon the aristocracy; for no representative of an ancient family could be supposed to die without leaving assets sufficient to pay his debts. No innovation was hereby intended. Did the friends of the aristocracy mean to insinuate; that the landed proprietors alone should not pay their debts? And was there not as powerful an aristocracy in Scotland, although the English law, on this subject, had no place? He declared he knew various instances of landed proprietors availing themselves of the law, as it now stood, to cheat their creditors. He knew the owner of an estate worth &#x00A3;4000 a year, whose predecessor's funeral expences and apothecary's bill remained unpaid. Another, who left debts to the amount of &#x00A3;40,000, and not above 2s. 6d. in the pound had been paid, although the successor to the estate came into possession of &#x00A3;4000 a year. There were many small traders, who had been unable to pay their own debts, and some had been thrown into prison on that account, because they could not compel payment of debts, due to them by landed proprietors.&#x2014;The report of the bill was then received without a division.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL]&#x2014;Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>adverted to the discussion which took place on Tuesday relative to the memorial of the lords of session, and to the desire which was then expressed of being informed of the opinions of the judges of the court of session respecting certain parts of the bill for the better regulation of courts of justice in Scotland. Whilst he was decidedly hostile to any proposition for receiving the opinions of the lords of session with respect to the expediency of the bill as a legislative measure, he still thought it of importance that their lordships should have the opportunity of putting questions to the judges of the court of session, or some of them, with respect to the practical effect which might be produced by any of the provisions of the bill. In making a proposition to effect this purpose, his object was to avoid all unnecessary delay, it being his earnest wish that the bill should pass through that house so as to allow a reasonable time for its discussion in the other house, and this also with a view to what, from the state of the business in par-
<col>84</col>
liament, there was every reason to expects namely, a termination of the session at an earlier period than had been usual for some time past. To send therefore questions for the opinion of all the judges of the court of session, must necessarily be productive of extreme delay; the only mode which appeared to him practicable, was to order the attendance of the lord president of the court of session, and the two senior lords of that court, during the discussion of this bill, with an understanding that any of the other lords whose convenience it might suit might also attend. His lordship concluded by moving, that the lord president of the court of session, and the two senior lords of that court, do attend the service of the house with all convenient speed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Kinnaird</member> <membercontribution>doubted, the propriety of hearing the lords of session at all, but if they were to be heard, whether they should not all be ordered to attend.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>observed, that if all the judges of the court of session were ordered to attend, it would greatly impede the regular course of justice in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Eldon</member> <membercontribution>concurred in the propriety of the motion, and suggested that the stage of the bill in which the attendance of the judges would be most useful would be in the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that no delay ought to take place in the progress of the bill, and that the house might still proceed on it in the manner originally proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Auckland</member> <membercontribution>was anxious to have it distinctly understood, that the attendance of any of the other lords of session who might find it convenient, would be desirable.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>approved of the motion, which he thought the only practicable mode of having the opinions of the judges of the court of session.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

&#x2014;Mr. Adam, pursuant to notice, moved that the order for taking the Aberdeenshire petition into consideration on the 24th instant, be discharged, in order to have it put off to the 13th of April. After a short conversation between Mr. R. Dundas, the lord advocate of Scotland, sir J. Pulteney, Mr. Perceval, Mr. Canning, and Mr. Adam, the motion was negatived without a division.&#x2014;Sir J. Newport brought up a bill for the improvement of the city of Dublin, which was read a first time; and, on the motion that it be read a second time on Monday next, Mr. Shaw (of Dublin) expressed a hope that the hon. baronet would not object to the printing of the bill, nor press the second reading on so early a day as Monday next. It was a measure by which the interest of his constituents might be very materially affected, and he was therefore anxious to have sufficient time to consider the provisions it contained, of which he was then ignorant, as well as to communicate with his constituents, the parties most interested, upon the subject. The Speaker informed the hon. gent. that, as the bill was, in a great measure, of a private nature, it fell within the provisions for regulating the proceedings upon private bills, and that, in like manner, as in the case of all private bills from Ireland, the period of three weeks must intervene between the first and second reading. The second reading was then fixed for Monday three weeks.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[WEST INDIA PLANTERS' PETITION.]&#x2014;Mr. Hibbert</member> <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, rose for the purpose of moving, that the Petition of the West India Planters, presented on the 27th of Feb. be referred to a select committee.&#x2014;The petition was then read, as follows:<lb/>
"To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled, the Petition of the undersigned Planters Merchants, Mortgagees, Annuitants and others, interested in the British West India Colonies,<lb/>
"Humbly sheweth, that the West India Colonies of Great Britain, having been planted and settled by British subjects, have, in long course of years, progressively advance in cultivation, wealth, and importance, from which the mother country has derived vast and increasing advantages, in respect to her commercial and financial resources, and her naval power.&#x2014;That the capital at present existing in the British West India Colonies, estimated at little less than one hundred mil-
<col>86</col>
lions, and which is for the most part an investment gradually created, in the course of nearly two centuries, out of the gains of the Colonial trade, is but a small part of the British stake in those important establishments. Your petitioners are ready to shew, by official vouchers, that nearly one-third of the whole of the British imports and exports is involved in the West India trade, directly or collaterally; and that, in more than that proportion, the effective defence and power of the empire depend thereon; as the best and most productive nursery of seamen.&#x2014;That the foundation of these benefits and this prosperity was laid by the act of King Charles II. chap 7, entituled 'An Act for the Encouragement of Trade,' the preamble of which uses these remarkable words: 'And in regard his majesty's plantations beyond the seas are inhabited and peopled by his subjects of this his kingdom of England; for the maintaining a greater correspondence and kindness between them, and keeping them in a firmer dependence upon it, and rendering them yet more beneficial and advantageous unto it, in the further employment and increase of English shipping and seamen, vent of English woollen and other manufactures and commodities, rendering the navigation to and from the same more safe and cheap and making this kingdom a staple not only of the commodities of those plantations, but also of the commodities of other countries and places, for the supplying of them, and it being the usage of other nations to keep their plantations trade to themselves.'&#x2014;That, in conformity to the intimate union and relations here delineated, the colonial system of Great Britain has, in subsequent times, been systematically established; whereby, in every essential respect, the industry, trade and navigation, of the Colonies, are strictly confined to the interests of the mother country; she, in return, granting to them and to their productions an exclusive or marked preference at her home markets, a facility of meeting in foreign markets a vent for the surplus of their produce beyond her own ample supply, and her needful support and protection against enemies, foreign and domestic.&#x2014;That, however, in various instances, and more particularly since the calamity that befell the once flourishing colony of St Domingo, (whereby a temporary and accidental encrease of value was given to the great staple productions of the Colonies), the colonial system of the British Empire has been varied or departed from, to the disadvantage
<image src="S1V0009P0I0059"/>
<col>87</col>
of her Colonies; restrictions have been imposed upon the access of their surplus produce to the foreign market, thereby affording a powerful stimulus to the cultivation of foreign Colonies; the production of their principal staple article, sugar, has been encouraged and promoted in dependencies of the empire not subject to colonial regulations; a progressive taxation on sugar has been accumulated, which is calculated to impede the natural progress of its consumption in a prosperous and luxurious nation; and, while the progress of taxes at home, naturally attending a state of war, has, in the course of the last twenty years, doubled the cost of every article which the Colonies import from the mother country for their use and necessary cultivation, the anxious care of the British legislature appears to have been directed to every measure that might, at any time, prevent the colonial produce from obtaining the advantages of any temporary. demand and addition to its value, unattended with regulations, on the other hand, competent to protect the colonist from depressed and ruinous prices.&#x2014;That, more particularly in the late wars, in which the mother country has unfortunately been compelled to engage, has the pressure of the existing colonial system been felt by the British West India Colonies; the access to a foreign market of that surplus produce, Which, for her advantage, and, in order to her own ample supply, the repeated public voice of the mother country has urged and stimulated the Colonies to grow, has been often impeded and sometimes denied.&#x2014; In the mean time, the produce of those colonies, which have, at any time, by the fortune of war, fallen into our hands, has been admitted to form an additional glut at the home market, and placed on a footing there with the produce of our old Colonies. And, as if to render the evil irreparable, and the case desperate, the great and acknowledged superiority of the British navy has not been exerted in impeding the transit of the colonial produce of the enemy to its European market, whereby the inducement, which the enemy might have, to except colonial produce from the rigour of our general exclusion from the continental trade, is taken away, and the British colonist, under all the increased and continually increasing expences of war is subjected to contend, now and henceforward, with rivals, exempted from those charges, and enjoying the most advantageous markets, without the impediment of British competition.&#x2014;That measure have
<col>88</col>
lately been recommended to parliament, professedly intended to afford relief to your petitioners, but which, so far as they respect sugar, the great staple article the British West India colonies, can only prove beneficial in case a channel of export be opened; but, during our present almost total exclusion from the continent, can have little effect in relieving the distress now felt by the growers and holders of sugar: and, that the proposed additional duties on spirits, although very wisely and providently intended, will be comparatively of small benefit to the British plantations, unless a decided and marked preference be given to the consumption of rum in the navy and army.&#x2014;That, under the progressive influence of the grievance, the effect of which has been experienced by your petitioners in the course of the last ten years, they are at last reduced to the hard necessity of continuing the cultivation of their estates at a very heavy loss, as they cannot be rendered productive in any other culture. Documents already on the table of your honorable house, supported by the most respectable evidence, shew, that the average price of sugar, at the British market, has been, for some time past, barely equal to, often beneath, its positive cost to the planter, without any the smallest return for the capital embarked on the plantations, for the support of decreasing population, or for the maintenance of that numerous class of British subjects, whose sole dependence has hitherto been the produce and income returned for British industry and skill, exerted in the cultivation of the West India colonies, whereby your petitioners are reduced to a distress which they humbly conceive calls for the immediate attention, investigation, and relief of the legislature.&#x2014;That your petitioners humbly suggest, as measures calculated for their relief, provisions of the following nature, either permanent, or co-existent with the present war, as may seem best to the wisdom of this honourable house; namely, a revision of the system of taxation on sugar, and a reduction in the rate thereof, which, under a proportionate extension of the home consumption, might probably not diminish the revenue; such provisions as may admit the article of sugar into preferable consumption in the distilleries and breweries, while its depression in price, compared with that of grain, may demand such preference; the permission to barter the staple articles of sugar and coffee, as well as those of rum and molasses, with the American States, in return for lumber
<image src="S1V0009P0I0060"/>
<col>89</col>
and other necessaries, for a needful supply of which the colonies depend on an intercourse with those states.&#x2014;And your petitioners humbly pray, that these measures, or such of them as may seem most expedient to this honourable house, or other measures adequate to the relief of your petitioners, under their present burthens and distress, may, by the wisdom of this honourable house, be provided and passed into law. And your petitioners shall ever pray, &amp;c."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert rose</member> <membercontribution>and said, that this was a petition of considerable and extensive interest. It stated the extreme hard case of a large body of his Majesty's industrious subjects, upon whose labours depended one great branch of our commerce, together with much of our maritime strength and financial prosperity, and who were reduced at length into the predicament of profiting nothing by their labours; a situation which threatened their inevitable decay and ruin. He would, in a very cursory manner, advert to the general principles of policy upon which these colonies had been established, and to that system under which they are connected with the mother country. The doctrines of the economists, and of Dr. Adam Smith in particular, had been supposed to be more adverse to that policy, and to that system, than they would, on examination, prove. Those theorists had laid down principles true and good in themselves, but not adapted to invariable practice; they had, as a sensible modern writer on colonial policy (Mr Brougham) observed, leaned too much upon positive institutions, and excluded from their consideration the influence of passion, taste, and caprice, upon the pursuits of men. It might be true, that the most safe and profitable direction of labour was to home trade, and to quick and frequent returns of capital; but in a maritime and commercial country, no legislative provisions could restrain the occasional impulse to emigrate towards new situations, and new objects of labour. Sir J. Child had rightly said, that "had England no colonies, she would entirely lose the profit of the labour of that description of her inhabitants which settle there; they would go to foreign countries, rather than not go at all." Now, if a committee of political economists were to sit, and to endeavour to turn to the best account the connection with such emigrants, would it not say, "Do not let us lose you; wherever you go, consider this as your home; send us your produce, remit us your gains; do not go to a continent where we
<col>90</col>
cannot so well protect you; go to islands, where our navy may be your guard. Do not build ships, or manufacture; those are our concerns; produce what we cannot raise at home, yet what we must buy elsewhere, if you do not send it to us, and what may also be valuable to others, if you send us more of it than we want. Do not depend on us for a large population of labourers in hot climates; you must find them elsewhere, for we have them not to spare to you." Could the strictest policy dictate otherwise? and yet this exactly describes our West India colonies: from small beginnings they rose, and now had reached a height of importance and prosperity, which gave them a distinguished rank among the remaining resource of the mother country. Thus the real value of the produce imported from these colonies was not less than 12 millions sterling, of which was annually re-exported, on the average, about the value of &#x00A3;5,500,000, a circumstance most important in the balance, of our trade, and in the regulation of the course of exchanges, and which, in very critical situations of this country, has been found (as bank directors and monied men could prove) the best check to the baneful effects of the drains of specie caused by large foreign subsidies. On the other hand, the export to the colonies (and almost entirely in British manufacture or British produce) was in real value not far short of &#x00A3;6,000,000. This trade employed from 900 to 1000 ships; the tonnage 250,000 tons; and at one man to each 14 tons (which was a reasonable allowance), upwards of 17,000 seamen. There could be no question as to the beneficial influence of all these items upon our maritime, commercial, and naval prosperity.&#x2014;It might not be uninteresting to compare this statement with the utmost height of the colonial strength of France, which she had attained at the moment of the revolution. She had then about the same number of ships which we now have in our colonial trade, of somewhat larger, tonnage, and carrying, in proportion to that tonnage, a larger number of seamen: the official value of her exports to the colonies was upwards of &#x00A3;3,000,000 sterling; of her imports, upwards of &#x00A3;7,000,000 sterling: and the relative importance of these imports in her foreign trade, was even greater than in our case; for it appeared, that she consumed at home a much smaller proportion of her colonial produce, and that by it, and by it alone, she turned the balance of her trade with all the world to a favourable results. Of 80 millions
<image src="S1V0009P0I0061"/>
<col>91</col>
of livres, the value of her export to the Baltic, 55 millions was in colonial produce; and of 424 millions of livres, the value of her exports to all Europe, the Levant, and continental America, 152 millions was in colonial produce. These particulars are sufficient to shew the grounds on which that axiom in French policy had been built, that her maritime and commercial prosperity were chiefly dependant on her West India colonies.&#x2014;He had heard and read some general objections to our colonial establishments, which he would very briefly notice. They had been said to occasion or to promote Wars. This he thought was a most unfounded objection; and he could not trace any thing in history to confirm it. The colonies had often been the victims, never the cause of wars; they became objects of cupidity to belligerent powers, but that only proved their general value and estimation. The epidemics which had of late proved fatal to Europeans in those climates, had also been alledged. He remembered when the West India climate was considered as healthy as any other in the same latitude. He believed that the existing fever was an imported malady; and there was a prevailing opinion, that another evil to which those climates were subject, a visitation of which they had not, however, lately experienced, that of a violent commotion of the elements, might, by its occasional recurrence, render the air purer and more healthful. The capital embarked in these establishments had been stated to be improvidently withdrawn from other safer and more profitable adventures; but it was very little known or considered that not only the amount of the capital now embarked in the colonies, but also a large balance of profit, had been accumulated in the different branches of that commerce, and was the gain of the mother country resulting from her long account with those establishments. Unquestionably, of the money now lent to the colonies, a considerable part might have been spared from other pursuits: but there had also been, on the other hand, large sums from time to time withdrawn from colonial commerce, and embarked in the agricultural and funded securities of the mother country: and upon the whole he was persuaded, from an attentive and long experience in the trade, that the balance resulting from the connection was very greatly in favour of the mother country. It was to be noticed, that the planting business was not the only profit of the colonists; that there were merchants and others resident in
<col>92</col>
the islands concerned in foreign traffic, or in serving and supplying the plantations, who grew rich by their commerce, and who had not yet been deterred from embarking their accumulations in the agricultural adventures of that country which had enriched them. If, then, for many years past, the successive administrations of this country had appeared to regard with coolness and indifference the colonies, and to adopt measures which rather indicated a jealousy of, than a wish to promote their welfare; if, in the publications of the present day, coming from respectable quarters, there appeared an anxiety to diminish their importance in the public estimation, to what were such sentiments to be imputed? Was it because these establishments were so intimately connected with us, that, whether the colonists themselves grew rich or not, the whole produce of their labours was sure to be ours? Was it because they were so securely our own and out of the reach of our inveterate enemy, that they were the objects of his envy, precisely in the proportion in which they were not the victims of his .power?&#x2014;that they did not require bullion from us, but sent it to us in return for our manufactures?&#x2014;that they neither built ships, nor made for themselves whatever we could make, but were employed in producing what we could neither produce nor do without, and what was an important addition to our means of commanding foreign trade, and of attracting foreign capital?&#x2014;that they did not require for their defence large armies concentred in one spot, and which, from their magnitude and their distance from the metropolis, became in themselves matter of reasonable jealousy to the mother country?&#x2014;or was it that the long intercourse we had enjoyed with our constantly attached and loyal colonies was grown insipid by its harmony, and that, as in the case of married couples who lived too much together, something like the <i>amantium ir&#x0153;</i> were wanting to stimulate regard, and rekindle mutual affection? If this were the case, and that we were only making a moral or philosophical experiment upon the passions of the colonists, it would be well if we were careful not to tickle them into a frenzy, or, what perhaps was more to be apprehended, pinch them to death.&#x2014;He should notice very briefly the colonial system, which was one of mutual monopoly;the mother country retaining to her own use land advantage, in all essential respects, their trade, navigation, and supply, and affording to them and to their produce, an exclusive
<image src="S1V0009P0I0062"/>
<col>93</col>
or marked preference at her markets. This system appeared to be of old date with great maritime powers; something like it might be traced in respect to the colonies of Carthage, of which evidence might be found in Polybius. Laws grounded upon it had progressively been enacted in this country, some under the Protectorate; but the system had taken a definite shape in the time of Charles II., and was admirably pointed out in the preamble to the celebrated act for the encouragement and regulation of trade passed in that reign; that preamble would be found to comprise the elements of our entire colonial system, and indicated the mutual monopoly; but, as was ever the case betwixt a stronger and a weaker party, the compact was less formal in the parts that bind the mother country than in those that bind the colonies: he would, however, state to the house, in this respect, the opinion of a much-lamented statesman, Mr. Fox, who, in 1781, when the sugar refiners petitioned parliament to admit foreign sugars on certain terms, into British consumption, and into use in the refineries, took the part of the colonies, and spoke in these words:&#x2014;"The noble lord (Beauchamp) had called the non-importation of prize sugars a mere Custom-house regulation, and therefore thought the rule might be easily dispensed with; but he must inform his lordship, that a compact more solemn than any act of parliament could create made that rule not to be infringed, for we had monopolized the produce of our plantations by unnatural restrictions on their trade. This was the only country in Europe in which they were permitted, by our laws, to sell their crops. Surely then, by every principle of reason and natural justice, they should also have an exclusive access to our markets, a monopoly subsisting on one side necessarily implying a monopoly also on the other. There was not any written agreement, but there was something more substantial; there was monopoly against monopoly. The West India planters were confined in the sale of their commodities to Britain, and Britain was confined to take their commodities from them and them only. This tacit bargain was confirmed not by words out by deeds; the planters enjoy certain privileges, and for those privileges they gave something in return, an ample equivalent; so that there was <i>quid pro quo,</i> which was allowed in the civil law to be a formal ratification of any compact or bargain." He recollected the debate, and believed that the sentiments he had taken from
<col>94</col>
the reporters of the day were those delivered by Mr. Fox. The petition of the sugar refiners was rejected, and the house gave its confirmation to the doctrines he had advanced. The complaint which the refiners addressed to the public on that occasion (and in which the public became interested parties), was, that the colonies barely and scantily supplied the home consumption of sugar, and furnished no materials for foreign trade, which it was alledged was the advantage to which this country ought to look; the colonies appear to have taken the hint, and to have profited by the lesson then given them.

Thus it appeared that the colonies had accomplished the object which the British public demanded of them, and had not only amply supplied our own consumption, but furnished us with a large surplus for our foreign trade. In 1791 an event happened, which appeared to throw a momentary gleam over the fortunes of the British colonies, but which, however, had, in reality, he thought, contributed to their distresses; the destruction of St. Domingo caused a considerable advance in the prices of sugar, and other colonial produce, and occasioned in this country much clamour among the public on account of those prices. The public became anxious for new sources of supply, and the East Indies were looked to; it was not considered that our East India possessions are not colonies, nor subject to our control, and subservient to our views as such. Lord Melville had pronounced, in a letter to the Directors,<sup>*</sup> his opinion that they never could be considered as colonies, for the reason that we could not command their exclusive trade. He did not mean to give more importance to the cultivation of sugar in India than it deserved; its consumption in this country appeared to be annually from 50 to 60,000 cwt., but its consumption in Europe,
<quote><sup>*</sup>Letter of the right hon. H. Dundas, the chairman of the East India Company, 15th April, 1793.</quote>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0063"/>
<col>95</col>
which had first been promoted and encouraged by us, was something more; and its consumption, both here and elsewhere, was probably now kept down by the excessive low prices of colonial produce; but, as a principle affecting our colonial system, the admission of East India sugar into our consumption, on the terms on which it now stands, could not be justified; and he would cite, on that subject, the opinion of a committee of the Court of Directors themselves, extracted from a report under the date of March 1802, and in which the following passage occurs:&#x2014;"It may become a question hereafter, how far the importation of sugar from the East, which leaves a loss to the importer, and the first cost of which is paid for by silver from hence, shall be encouraged to the prejudice of the West India sugar, the cost of which is either spent by the proprietor in the mother country, or paid for by the manufactures or stores exported from home; for silver is often received from the islands, but seldom sent thither. The balance of trade is, as it always must be in future, in favour of India; it is therefore highly important to probe the question, which relates to the cultivation and importation of such an article as sugar from the East, to the bottom. The value of every rupee invested in sugar, and imported from the East, is an additional rupee to the balance of trade against the mother country. Some able and well-intentioned persons have made it a question, whether sugar may not be supplied from India to almost an indefinite amount; but they are not aware that the success, or, in other words, the benefit of India, in this instance, would prove the destruction of the mother country, which could not exist under the immense drain of bullion that must follow. If the East was in the same predicament with the West Indies, when the cost of the sugar was either spent in Great Britain and Ireland, or paid for in manufactures and stores, it would be consistent with the soundest principles of political arithmetic to encourage the importation by every possible means." The house would observe that this was not the opinion of a committee of West India planters and merchants, but was signed with the respectable names of the East India directors, C. Mills, J. Roberts, F. Baring, J. Bosanquet, H. Inglis, J. Cotton, A. Robarts, and E. Parry. The evil attending the St. Domingo revo-
<col>96</col>
lution, however, did not stop here; the scarcity of colonial produce which it occasioned, suggested to the British ministry the delusive project of making foreigners pay a part of our heavy duty on sugar. It was said that we had the whole colonial trade under our command&#x2014;that foreigners must take their sugar from us, and that we might therefore safely deny a proportion of our drawbacks and bounties on the re-export. This expedient was brought forward in 1796, was approved by parliament, and in that year 4s. were taken from the drawback on the raw sugar, and 7s. from the bounty on refined. This he considered as a most impolitic measure, a mere expedient of the moment to get over the difficulties of the year; and he was sorry to say, that, in the whole course of his mercantile experience and intercourse with ministers on commercial subjects, he had too often found that the expedient of the year was the chief object, and that others, perhaps eventually more important, must give way to that. Like greedy and improvident farmers, it was the year's crop we looked to, one white crop perhaps after another, and stimulated most likely by alkalis and forcers of all sorts; regardless whether we were or were not reducing the soil to a <i>caput mortuum</i> but let the soil be once reduced to a <i>caput mortuum</i>, and then neither the farmer nor the financier will find their crops stack or thresh out well.&#x2014;In 1799, this pernicious measure received new force, by a further reduction of the drawbacks and bounties, on the same alledged principle as before; but the delusion did not last long; for in that year, a Report from the West India merchants was made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, affording the most irrefragable evidence that Great Britain did not in fact command the colonial trade, or the supply of Europe with colonial produce: that report states, that there entered at the port of Hamburgh, between the 8th March and 10th Sept. 1799, chiefly laded with sugar and coffee&#x2014;146 ships from America, 3 from the Havannah, 7 from the East Indies, with sugar, 18 from the neutral West Indies, 56 from Lisbon and Oporto; in all 230; and that, from all the British ports, there had only arrived, in that time, 211 ships, of a small tonnage, and not entirely laden with colonial produce. This representation, or the facts to which it relates, and the evident decline of our export of colonial produce, caused the restoration of the drawbacks and bounties to their old standard: but the channel of trade had
<image src="S1V0009P0I0064"/>
<col>97</col>
taken a new course, and a very material stimulus had been given to the cultivation of the Spanish and other rival colonies.&#x2014;The duty on sugar had been increased at different times from 3s. 6d.,at which it stood about 60 years ago, to its present rate of 27s. per cwt., with a further provisional tax hanging over it of 3s. per cwt. When the duty was only 3s 6d., a writer of the name of Massy had computed, that 16s. per cwt. was an ample price for sugar at this market, and paid the planter a fair return upon his capital. I mention this, said Mr. H., for the purpose of shewing how erroneously we judge, when we see a rapid and astonishing advance in the price of articles, and infer that the producer of them is growing rich in proportion to that advance; for it now stood upon most respectable evidence, in a report upon the table of the house (the Report of the Sugar Distillery Committee), that when the consumer at sugar paid for it 63s. per cwt., not one shilling of that amount went into the pockets of the grower. It was in fact thus applied&#x2014;

so that, with the exception of a pittance that went to America for articles of the first necessity, the whole came directly into the pockets of various descriptions of British subjects, and circulated in every possible channel that could interest the capitalist, the manufacturer, and, the landholder.&#x2014;He was ready to acknowledge that the magnitude and amount of the duty on the British consumption of sugar was a matter that could not be oppressive on the colonies, so long as a market, at a fair price, was found for their produce, so long as its consumption at home was not impeded, and that for its surplus, by
<col>98</col>
the aid of just drawbacks and bounties, a foreign vent was obtained; but it must be evident, that, in the failure of such export, and in case a large and unusual quantity were thrown and forced upon the home consumption, the duty must, in such case, fall upon the grower, since the price he got must be that reduced price at which he could tempt an extra consumption of the article at home, even if it were by making it the food of cattle; that in 1803, a war duty of 4s. was added on this article, and the planters were assured that it must fall on the consumers, as the export trade would soon be freed from impediments. It happened, however, that the whole of that duty, aggravated additional charges, originating in the renewal of war, did fall upon the growers. In, fact, the duty must ever do so, unless a fair price, at the foreign market for the surplus produce be obtained.&#x2014;That the result was this: it had been held in that house, that a British subject, having embarked his property in a manufacture at home, attended with labour and risk, had a right to expect 10 per cent. as a fair return upon his capital. The colonist, who manufactures sugar in distant islands, is surely entitled to at least as much; yet 10 per cent. upon a colonial capital, embarked in a sugar plantation, he was ready to prove, would require 25s. to 30s. per cwt. free from all charges whatsoever, upon the sugar produced. Now, what had been, for many years past, the situation of the west India planter?
In 1786 and 1787, he got about 19s 6d. per cwt. free from charges.

for the greater part of the crop of 1806 had sold for about 35s. 6d. per cwt. ex duty when 36s. ex duty has been proved to be the cost of producing it&#x2014;This he considered was a case demanding the consideration of parliament; for he could produce high authority<sup>*</sup> for the maxim, that when a class of industrious cultivators are labouring at prices inadequate to their support, the:statesman ought to consider it better that they should be relieved, and the burthen sustained by the whole community, than that it,should fall upon and crush that single class.&#x2014;He might be asked, what can parliament do?

Had they not lately passed a bill for the relief of the trade? They had indeed passed some regulations tending to encourage an export, but, alas, the door of export was not open!&#x2014;He considered that there were various means of relief possible and practicable; and although obstacles in respect to each presented themselves, those obstacles ought to be considered in relation to the object to be obtained. A small and inconsiderable object deserved to be set aside by almost any serious obstacle; but the obstacle might be great and weighty, and yet the object might be much more so. He thought that when the distress of this trade came to be considered with attention, and the consequences that might result from that distress traced into all the channels which it was likely to reach, parliament would be of opinion that it deserved to be relieved even at some risk, and at the expense of some sacrifices; but he would slightly consider the several means of relief which the petition itself suggested.&#x2014;In respect to the present duty levied on sugar, it was evident that relief might be granted in that respect, even without any sacrifice of revenue, should a forced and extraordinary consumption take place in consequence of the export being stopped. If we consumed an additional million of cwts. (one third of our whole import), which we usually exported, we might evidently abate one third of the duty, and yet not be losers; but, even were a greater reduction demanded from us, it would be more prudent to support the grower of that which gave the duty, than to levy the tax rigorously to his ruin.&#x2014;An extra consumption at home in the distilleries or breweries might seem to be now out of the question, since the report of the committee on the subject: the committee, however, had only determined upon the present inexpediency of that measure, and had even recommended that steps should be taken for obviating any obstructions which exist to its future adoption, in case it should become necessary; and the growers of grain need not be jealous of such an interference with them, since, were it judged proper to permit a free export of grain to the West Indies, more would be so exported than the distilleries now took off, arid with additional advantage to the islands.&#x2014;The permission to America to take sugar and coffee in return for the lumber and provisions she supplied, had been granted formerly, and might be granted again, either experimentally, and as a temporary relief, or under certain permanent limits, without any

detrimental interference with the colonial system, the value of which he was not disposed in general to contest, or unnecessarily to interfere with its restrictions. But there was another subject on which he was very little inclined to dwell, as he knew that it stood connected with many great and important interests; yet the welfare and support of the colonies was unquestionably one of those interests, and it might be right for the committee to enquire how far the welfare and very existence of our own colonies were endangered by the consideration which we persist in paying to the claims of neutrals, in forbearing to impede, as in time of war we might, the transit of our enemy's colonial produce to the European markets, under all the advantage and security of the neutral flags, thus taking away the inducement which the enemy might have to except colonial produce from the rigour of his general exclusion of our commerce. Certain he was, that none of the neutrals, not America herself, could have one interest more dear and valuable than that of preventing Great Britain from sinking in a contest, in which she was the bulwark of all that remained of independence in the civilized world, and in which she must certainly sink, if she be not enabled to avail herself of her wonted resources, arising from the industry of her subjects in every part of her extended empire.&#x2014;For these reasons he trusted that there world be no objection to his motion. The noble lord who now conducted the finance department (lord H. Petty) had expressed his approbation of the measure; that noble lord had been educated in sound principles of political science, and he trusted that while he collected the stream of public prosperity, he would not neglect its source.&#x2014;The hon. gent. then moved, "That the petition of the West India planters, merchants, and others, be referred to a select committee of this house to consider the same, and to report, from time to time, to the house, their opinions and observations thereon."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Jacob</member> <membercontribution>begged to enter his protest against the statement of the hon. gent. that either the present administration, or the one that preceded it, or that of lord Sidmouth, had been either cool or indifferent respecting the interests of the colonies. The American intercourse bill of last session shewed the attention of the present ministers to the wants and accommodation of the colonies.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>felt himself called upon by the allusion to the American intercourse bill, to

<col>101</col>
state, that he still considered it as an injurious measure. If not for that, the whole shipping trading to the colonies would, in a year or two, be in the hands of this country. Not more than one sixth of the manufactures exported from this country was sent to Spanish America.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Temple </member> <membercontribution>defended the American intercourse bill from the statement of the right hon. gent., who had gone so much out of his way to repeat his former opinion upon that measure. He should be happy to meet that hon. gent. on the subject, and was confident he could prove that the measure was highly beneficial to the colonies. The only difficulty that had arisen respecting it, was, that the colonies did not think it went far enough, and expected more than his majesty's ministers would or could concede.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>was happy that this question had been brought under consideration before the passing of the Slave Trade Abolition bill, because the distress complained of in the petition could not be imputed to that measure. He had long regretted the extraordinary increase of capital employed in procuring colonial produce; but certainly should not object to any just consideration for the distresses complained of.&#x2014;The petition was then referred to a select committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MUTINY BILL.] Mr. Hobhouse</member> <membercontribution>brought up the report of the committee on the mutiny bill A desultory conversation ensued on the various clauses, in which Mr. Bastard, the Secretary at War, Mr. Windham, colonel Wood, Mr. Yorke, Mr. Canning, and sir John Doyle participated. All the clauses were eventually agreed to.&#x2014;On the Speaker's inquiry, whether any amendments were proposed to be made in the body of the bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh rose </member>. <membercontribution>He considered the system of the right hon. secretary for the war department as too complicated to effect its own purpose. In the papers on the table was a case which satisfied his own mind that that system was wholly inadequate to maintain the necessary present force, and was calculated to involve the country in future hazard, unless some modification of it, such as that which it was his intention to propose, should be adopted by parliament. He contended, that since the defence of the country had been entrusted to the right hon. gent., it had been materially deteriorated. Indeed, the right hon. gent. seemed to admit that the home defence was inadequate to its object; for otherwise, after having blamed the predecessors of the
<col>102</col>
present administration for not having assisted the continent, he would hardly have abstained from making a single exertion to co-operate with our allies, or to prevent the French from carrying their troops from the Coast to the Vistula. Nothing had been done, with the exception of that enormous subsidy of &#x00A3;80,000 to Prussia, for which his majesty's ministers had even thought necessary to apologise. Fifteen or twenty thousand men had been sent on distant foreign service, and by that means the home defence had been much weakened. The volunteers also, that right arm of the public force, had been withered under the right hon. gent's superintendance; and with respect to the Training bill, which was to bear down all before it, from the day that that bill had passed, nothing had been done, but making out the lists and apportionments, though a whole twelve-month had elapsed. For all this deduction from the home defence, we might be consoled, if the body of the force detached abroad had been sent on objects of real importance; but here the right hon. gent. was equally unfortunate. At that moment, 20,000 men, the flower of the British army, were locked up in Sicily, remote from every thing that it was the interest of the country to endeavour to acquire. The conduct of his majesty's ministers, with regard to South America, had been equally vacillating, and equally unwise; not a step had been taken by them till the negotiation at Paris had terminated. The noble lord animadverted with severity on the expedition under colonel Craufurd, of whose destination, he believed ministers themselves had no clear conception. With regard to the modification which he meant to propose, it was clear that the right hon. gent. could not allege that his measure had been adequate to the immediate necessities of the country; and if not so, it would be much less adequate to the waste which his system contained within itself; a waste, doubling the usual casualties of the army. The modifications he proposed would not, however, prevent the continuation of the right hon. gent's experiment; it went merely to allow those recruits who wished to do so, to enlist for life instead of a limited period, thus counteracting the dangerous effects of the existing system. The documents on the table proved, that up to the first of January last, the right hon. gent's plan had riot produced more than was formerly produced by the ordinary recruiting. Since that period, he was happy to find, that the number raised was in-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0067"/>
<col>103</col>
creasing, but this was owing to circumstances applicable to any system, and above all, to the notice given to officers of second battalions, that unless a certain number of men were raised within a limited period, those battalions would be reduced. He compared the right hon. gent's system with the Additional Defence act, and having argued at considerable length, in deprecation of the one, and in defence of the other, concluded by moving, as a proviso to that clause of the bill which related to the administration of oaths to recruits, that if any recruit should declare before a magistrate his intention of enlisting, but not for a limited time, on receiving such bounty as his majesty should think proper to offer, it should be lawful for the magistrate to take his oath for such extended service.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Windham</member> <membercontribution>said, he was glad to find that the noble lord, though not uniformly, had allowed that his plan had succeeded. The fact was, that the recruiting had increased, and the desertions had diminished. The general force of the country had been augmented, and as to the home defence, unless the enemy were to meet with greater successes than those of which we were at present apprised, it would be some time before any tremendous danger could be apprehended. The noble lord had been perfectly safe in his observations on the expedition under colonel Craufurd, because he knew that it was unlit at present to divulge the object of that expedition. "But," says the noble lord, "why not "harass the enemy in some other place?" Would not this reduce the home defence of which the noble lord was so tenacious? As to activity, an injudicious and imprudent activity was more dangerous than indolence; for in military subjects he could not agree with the French proverb, which said, in the idiom of that language, "It is better to do nothings than nothing." The noble lord cried out for expeditions. What sort of precedents of expeditions had the administration, of which the noble lord had formed a part, afforded? Had not the noble lord, by sending out his expeditions, contrived to drown a great many men in the English channel, and to wreck a great many others on the enemy's coasts? As to the diminution in the energy of the volunteers, their zeal and activity had been called forth by the danger of the country; should the country again be in danger, he had no doubt that that zeal and activity would again be displayed, but at present there was no motive fur their ex-
<col>104</col>
ertions. The noble lord complained, that his (Mr W's) bill had not done what it never professed to do, namely, in seven months to cause an immense increase in the army. A measure intended to produce a regular, permanent, and increasing supply, was, incapable of making a great and sudden accession. He combated the comparison which the noble lord had instituted, between the present military system and the defence bill of the last administration, and contended, in contradiction to the noble lord, that the superiority was greatly on the side of the former. He shewed, from a comparison of the returns, that the produce of the regular recruiting, under the former system, was to the present only in the proportion of 214 men a week to 509. The desertions were under the former system; in the last six months of the year 1805, as 1 to 157; in the last six months of 1806, the proportion was as 1 to 268. The improvement in both these great points continued to increase to the present hour; and in proportion as the new measures began to be better understood, their operation would be more extensive. Their influence was founded on the fixed principles of human nature. It was not by affording the present means of debauchery that he sought to fill the army, but by holding out prospective rewards, to which it was desirable that the minds of the people should be fixed; and, therefore, the amendment of the noble lord was to be deprecated, as going to undermine and unsettle the root they had already taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>stated, that calculating the expense of recruiting parties, coupled with the bounty of 18l. it made every man cost the country 38l. by the time they joined. Calculating the increased expense of Chelsea, the expense was not less than 65l. a man. The expense of Chelsea, on the present system, would amount, in time of peace, to between 700,000l. and 1,000,000l. a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Shipley </member>, <membercontribution>from his experience in his own regiment, assured the house that recruits were obtained in greater numbers and of better quality; not the debauched outcasts of the manufacturing towns, but the sons of the yeomanry, sent by their fathers to devote a part of their youth to the promotion of the glory of their country, in a war which was maintained for the preservation of the rights of mankind.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Barry</member> <membercontribution>bore testimony to the same satisfactory operation of the new measures with respect to his own regiment.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0068"/>
<col>105</col>
<p><member>Sir James Pulteney</member> <membercontribution>repeated his former arguments against discharging men in the middle of a war. Great mischief would arise from that principle in the colonies, and with all our naval superiority, it would be found extremely difficult to transport the men backwards and forwards, as often as it would be necessary; he thought it unfair to institute a comparison between the ordinary recruiting now, and what it was while the Additional Force act subsisted. It would appear, on examination, that as great a proportion of recruits deserted now as under the former system.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Doyle rose </member>, <membercontribution>amidst a very general call for the question. If he had not been warned to be brief by the lateness of the hour, ha should not be so stupid as not to take the hint gentlemen were so kind as to give him. (a laugh). He was against the amendment, as it went to mix limited and unlimited service. The very objection the gentlemen opposite urged formerly against his right hon. friend's plan was, that it would have this effect; and yet they now brought forward as an amendment a principle which would have the same effect permanently, and in a much greater degree. His right hon. friend's plan had been stigmatized as visionary, theoretic, and quixotic. Its theory was, that by accomodating the service to the feelings and principles of human nature, more men would be obtained, and of a better quality. The theory of the noble lord was, that by making the situation of the soldier worse, and binding him to it for life, he would enter into it more readily, and remain in it more contented. The regiment he had the honour to command had been twice filled up so as to exceed its compliment under the present plan, thought it had at one time sent 250 men, and at another 200 to the first battalion. There was a physical as well as a moral improvement in the quality of the recruits. (Here there was a general coughing, which was stopped by a cry of order!) The hon. Bart. said, he was happy to find that the coughing did not proceed from any indisposition in the health of the house, though it might from an indisposition to hear him (a laugh). The measure produced 500 men a week since January, which was in the proportion of 26,000 a year. If this measure was visionary and quixotic, he wished we had more of such quixotism. The physical superiority of the recruits now detained was evinced by the small proportion rejected; their moral superiority by the reduced number of de-
<col>106</col>
sertions. He was sure, that however cold calculation might anticipate the possibility of the return of a large number of men at the expiration of their periods, leaving our colonial service in a circumstance of great exigency, there would always be found in the bosom of British soldiers a spirit which would never permit them to return to their homes while the service of their country required their service abroad. He cited the instance of a Scotch regiment under Marquis Cornwallis, in India, which, though its period of service had expired, volunteered for an expedition then fitting out, with the exception of two men, who afterwards came back, and begged to be received, but whom the regiment, with a becoming esprit de corps, refused to receive. He also cited the instance of the new regiments raised for service, limited in point of space as well as of time, that volunteered to accompany sir Ralph Abercrombie in his expedition to Egypt, and argued for unlimited service both in time and space, in order to have their offers accepted. He saw all this, and felt and marked it as a proof of national honour, which would never admit a British soldier to avail himself of the expiration of his period of service, in order to retire, when his country should be in want of his arm, but on the contrary would prompt him to renew his engagement and to persevere till the danger was dissipated. Having set out with the intention to be brief, and having received frequent hints from gentlemen to that effect he would now sit down; for, though he had something more to say, he thought he could not leave the house under a better impression than what he had just said was calculated to produce.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>thanked the hon. general for his statement. Though not intended for that purpose, it fully corroborated many of the predictions made by himself and his friends respecting the consequences of the military plan introduced by the right hon. secretary. Frequently had he adverted to the inconveniencies and difficulties that must arise from that plan to the colonial service, from the discharge of men in time of war, &amp;c.; but it would seem that men now crowded so thick to fill up the ranks, that all these inconveniences and difficulties would vanish before the magic operation of the new system. Yet he could not help wishing that the effects of this astonishing bill might be compared with those not only of the recruiting, but also of the parish bill. It would then be seen (and he could
<image src="S1V0009P0I0069"/>
<col>107</col>
prove it even from the papers on the table) that the two months, namely February and March, of the year 1805, exceeded the returns of the two favourite months, set forth as so productive, under the influence of the new system. Even in the last stage of its existence, the parish bill produced 1265 men, a greater number than was now obtained from the full vigour of this new plan. As to the volunteers, that system was acknowledged to be at an end; for the danger of invasion was said to be over, and that alone kept them together. It would therefore appear, even from the confession of the right hon. gent. that those "depositories of pa-"nic" only came forward in the hour of danger; that when danger shewed itself, then it is they flock to their standards. The hon. and learned gent. concluded by adverting to the expedition in which a gallant colonel (Craufurd) had been engaged, who so frequently detained the attention of the house by his observations upon military affairs. He trusted, that to whatever part of the globe he was destined, he carried with him the countenance of ministers. He hoped that his labours would be crowned with success, and that he would not have to report his triumphs to ungrateful masters (hear! hear!). That if he should be fortunate enough to secure for his country as great a conquest as the Cape of Good Hope, he would be at least entitled to the gratitude of this house, or be allowed to wear his hard-earned laurels, without obloquy and reproach(hear! hear!) It was an awful prospect for the country, it was an awful lesson naval and military gentlemen of the house, to reflect, that they were to earn their professional character and fame, by their service within these walls. (Loud cries of hear! hear!)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>begged to ask the learned gent. if he wished to insinuate that the hon. colonel (Craufurd) to whom he had alluded, had obtained his present appointment in consequence of any services he was supposed to have rendered government in that house?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>disclaimed any such insinuation, and observed, that he must have been wholly misunderstood by the right hon. gent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fawkes</member> <membercontribution>begged to be allowed to make a single observation. He did not pretend to know what was the destination of the hon. colonel so strangely alluded to; but whatever might be that destination, he trusted that should that honourable officer disregard his instructions, and divert to any other purpose the force entrusted to him, but that
<col>108</col>
which his orders pointed out, he would be brought to a court-martial, to have his conduct cleared; or otherwise, that he would have to relate his story to "ungrateful masters."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>again rose to explain, and declared, that he was likewise misunderstood by the hon. gent. who spoke last.&#x2014;The house then divided on the amendment. For it 60. Against it 179. Majority against it 119. The bill was then ordered to be engrossed.&#x2014;The second reading of the Roman Catholics' Army Service bill was deferred till Tuesday next, after which the house adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

He conceived the proposed division of the court of session into three chambers, with a superior court of appeal, to be an infraction of the articles of union, inasmuch as the court of session Would thus no longer be the supreme court of Scotland, but would be rendered inferior to another court, namely, the court of appeal. The
<col>110</col>
division into three chambers might also be productive of serious inconveniences; a case, for instance, decided by a majority of ten judges to four, might, by the operation of this bill, be again decided upon by four judges in one of these three chambers, and these four might happen to be the minority on the former decision. The chamber of review would, he thought, also defeat the object sought to be attained, namely, the more speedy administration of justice, by again narrowing the channel of that administration; and he had little doubt that this new court of appeal, if established, would soon be as much overloaded with appeals as that house was at present. He thought it would be much more advisable to divide the court of session into two chambers, consisting of eight judges, and seven, from each of which three judges might be detached into the outer house, to do the business there in a manner more complete than that now practised. The judges might take it in rotation every year to go into the outer house. If this mode was adopted, and the courts were empowered to give possession in consequence of judgment, and to order the payment of money, or to take good security in case of an appeal, and also, if in that house costs were given on appeals to the extent of the expence actually incurred, together with damages for any injury sustained, there would be no necessity for an intermediate court of appeal, and appeals to that house would become much less frequent. With respect to the introduction of trial by jury, he thought it an experiment replete with difficulty, and one that ought not to be tried without the most mature consideration, at least, the experiment ought to he confined, in the first instance, to the city of Edinburgh. In order, therefore, that there might be still further time given for the consideration of this very important part of the subject, he moved an instruction to the committee to divide the bill into two or more bills, in order to keep that part of the bill relating to the judicature, and that respecting trial by jury, perfectly distinct.&#x2014;This motion was not put, the first question being on the committal of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Redesdale</member> <membercontribution>considered the present measure as a breach of the act of union, as, if it was carried into effect, the court of session would, in fact, no longer exist.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member> <membercontribution>contended that it was perfectly consistent with the act of union to make regulations for the better administration of justice in Scotland, and this measure
<image src="S1V0009P0I0071"/>
<col>111</col>
did nothing more. He could not conceive that the establishment of an intermediate court of appeal would tend to increase appeals, as experience in this country, with respect to the court of exchequer chamber, proved directly the reverse.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Eldon</member> <membercontribution>was of opinion that the proposed division of the court of session into three chambers was not consistent with the spirit of the act of union; he thought that much might be done by the mode proposed by the noble duke, by establishing two chambers, whilst, at the same time, the act of union would not be infringed. His lordship examined different provisions of the bill, and contended that they were extremely defective with respect to the directions given for resorting to trials by jury, and appeared to have been framed without a due consideration of the nature of pleadings in the court of session, which were so different to those adopted in the courts of law in Westminster-hall. He had considerable doubts respecting that part of the bill which related to trial by jury, and thought it would be better to separate it from the other. It was a most important subject, and called for the earnest and serious attention of their lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>thought it unnecessary for the noble and learned lord to remind their lordships that this subject demanded their earnest and anxious attention, as those by whom the measure had been brought forward had not failed to impress upon the house the great importance of the measure, and had earnestly solicited for all the assistance which could be derived for its completion, both in and out of that house. The greater part of the noble and learned lord's objections referred to particular provisions of the bill, which would be better discussed in the committee, and where it would be found that most of them had already been anticipated. No sufficient reason had, in his mind, been urged for dividing this bill into two, particularly after the subject had so long been under consideration. As to the objection that this measure was an infringement of the act of union, it did not appear to him to be in the least well founded. It was clear that there existed an absolute necessity for remedying the evils Which resulted from the accumulation of business in the court of session more than that court could possibly get through, and the accumulation of appeals in that house. The necessity of some remedy was so evident, that those noble lords who objected to
<col>112</col>
this measure proposed as a substitute the division into two chambers. If the division into three chambers was however an infringement of the act of union, it was perfectly clear, that the division into two chambers was also an infringement. He, however, could not conceive there was any doubt that parliament had the power of making enactments for the better regulation of the court of session. It was a power recognized by an act of the Scotch parliament, and reserved by the words inserted in the article of the act of union. It would be absurd to suppose that the court of session had the power which was acknowledged, of regulating their own proceedings, but that parliament had no paramount power over them. With respect to the trial by jury, the reasons which had been stated for not introducing it into Scotland appeared to him to be the best reasons for its introduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville</member> <membercontribution>declared himself friendly to the principle of diminishing the number of lords of session. He had formerly proposed a bill for diminishing their number to ten; but he confessed he thought the proposition of the noble lord for dividing them into three chambers, much more preferable. He doubted, however, the propriety of establishing a court of review, which he thought an infringement of the act of union, whilst, at the same time, it would not tend' to diminish the number of appeals to that house, as the litigants would still be anxious to appeal to the last resort. With respect to the trial by jury, he did not think it would be productive of those beneficial effects which were looked for by the proposers of the bill; it was ill suited to the habits of the people of Scotland, neither did they wish for its introduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>quoted the 18th and 19th articles of union, for the purpose of proving that the present measure was no infringement upon that act, there being an express reservation that regulations might be adopted for the administration of justice, consistently with public policy, and for the evident utility of the subject. The division of the court of session into three chambers, and the establishment of a court of review, were questions of public policy, respecting which parliament had undoubtedly the power of deciding. The court of session had formerly established regulations by acts of sederunt for the more speedy administration of justice, and it were absurd to suppose that parliament had not tie paramount power to enforce regulations for the better
<image src="S1V0009P0I0072"/>
<col>113</col>
administration of justice. The introduction of the trial by jury formed part of the resolutions passed last session, and since that period no petition had been presented to the house from any part of Scotland against that part of the plan. He was therefore warranted in supposing that there was no objection to its introduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member>, <membercontribution>after modestly apologising for offering himself to the attention of the house upon such a subject, expressed himself of the same opinion with the noble lord (Melville), and cited an opinion delivered by that great lawyer, the earl of Mansfield, that the introduction of the trial by jury in Scotland, so far from being advisable, might be attended with much hazard in the experiment; so totally unsuited was it to the habits and prejudices of the people.&#x2014;The house then went into a committee <i>pro forma</i>, in which lord Eldon gave notice that he should, when they came to the clause relative to the trial by jury, move that it be omitted, for the purpose of having another substituted, better suited to answer the desired purpose.&#x2014;Progress was then reported, and the committee obtained leave to sit again on Wednesday.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. Eyre</member>, <membercontribution>chairman of the committee appointed to try the merits of the petition complaining of an undue election for the borough of Guildford, reported, that Mr. Sumner was not duly elected, and that the petitioner, the hon. Chapple Norton, was duly elected; but that the opposition of Mr. Sumner to the petition was not frivolous or vexatious. The clerk of the crown was ordered to attend the next day to amend the return, by erasing the name of Mr. Sumner, and inserting that of Mr. Norton in its place.&#x2014;On the motion of Mr. Hobhouse, it was ordered that, at the rising of the house that day, lord Bruce, who had been taken into the custody of the serjeant at arms, in consequence of default at the election ballot, should be discharged, on paying his fees.&#x2014;On the motion of lord Temple, a new writ was ordered for the election of a member for the borough of Buckingham, in the room of sir W. Young, who had accepted the office of governor of the island of Tobago.&#x2014;Mr. Courtenay moved, that the order for the consideration of the Culross election petition, be deferred to the 16th of May. Sir J. Anstruther said, that though the sitting member was willing to agree to a reasonable
<col>114</col>
delay, he could by no means agree to a delay which would, perhaps, be the means of putting off the trial of this case to the next session. He would agree to a delay of three or four weeks. The consideration of the Culross petition was then fixed for April 16.&#x2014;Lord John Thynne moved the order of the day for the second reading of the Bath Common division bill. Lord Ossulston opposed the motion, as the bill went to interfere with one of the principal and most airy walks of the invalids who resorted to Bath. He moved, as an amendment, that the bill be read a second time t hat day three months. The bill was defended by lord John Thynne, Mr. Palmer, and Mr. Hobhouse. A division took place; for reading the bill a second time now 49, against it 78, majority 29. A second division then took place on the question for reading the bill a second time that day three months: when there appeared for the motion 57, against it 49. The bill was of course lost by a majority of 8.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SLAVE TRADE ABOLITION BILL.] Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for the third reading of the Slave Trade Abolition bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert rose</member> <membercontribution>and said:&#x2014;I do not rise, sir, with the vain hope of changing, by any observations of mine, the determination which the house has expressed, in a manner so decided, upon this question, but rather with an anxious wish to record an opinion, grounded on consistent principles, and unaltered by any thing which I have heard upon a subject so interesting and important. In adherence to consistency, which, rather than popularity, is my object, I shall appear to differ more with the prevailing sentiment of the house than some of my hon. friends have done, who have yet united with me in opposition to this measure; for, after the concessions which they have made upon the points of legality, humanity, and justice, I do not see how we can sit down and deliberate Upon the policy and expediency of keeping open the trade; we fall, too, in so doing, under the censure of the hon. member for Bedford, (Mr. Whitbread) who thinks that in the debate we have "given too much into cool discussion." In which reprehension he includes, I presume, the noble lord (Howick) who introduced bill into the house, and. the noble lord (H. Petty) who sits upon the same bench, and who certainly did not, either of them, encourage that declamatory tone which has too much prevailed in this debate. The hon. member himself took care nut to copy their
<image src="S1V0009P0I0073"/>
<col>115</col>
error, for he asked us whether it was necessary that we should prove that robbery and murder are unlawful? Certainly we need not trouble the hon. gent. for such proof, but if might have been as well if he had shewn how robbery and murder are to be prevented by this bill; in what. sense it is calculated to do good rather than mischief, to confer benefits adequate to the evils it inflicts, and the risques it imposes upon humanity. The hon. member has intimated a conjecture, that the crimes attendant upon the Slave Trade in the West Indies have provoked the judgments of God, and that the hurricanes to which those climates are subject ore the signals of his vengeance. Sir, these is much moral and physical evil in the world, but it is a bold and rash attempt in any mortal to impute that evil as a judgment of Providence upon the heads on which it may chance to fall. Where an individual perishes in the actual commission of a crime, we may be allowed to draw a profitable lesson from so striking an incident; but where calamities consistent with the course of nature extend themselves over large districts, and afflict persons of various descriptions, there is something peculiarly rash in pronouncing that the sufferers are the victims of divine justice. I am better acquainted with the history of Jamaica than with that of any other island in the West Indies. Jamaica has been for 20 years free from hurricanes, that period no way marked by a forbearance as to the purchase or labour of slaves In 4 years, nearly successive, hurricanes have visited that island, and have specially deso lated one of its districts&#x2014;that district and those years not chargeable with any extraordinary concern with the slave trade. Those calamities have swept away large fleets of British ships returning from conquest over the enemies of their country, in nowise participating in the slave trade; and, what is still more worthy of remark, I do not find that any corresponding judgment has, at those periods, fallen upon British legislators and statesmen, the authors and promoters of the slave trade, who, as I shall shew, did not make their acts of parliament in ignorance, but knew well what they were doing; neither upon them, nor upon the nation whose affairs they administered, did such judgments attach; but, on the contrary, the era in which the slave trade was authorized and encouraged by the British legislature was one of distinguished prosperity in that country, one in inch she became the envy of the world.&#x2014; Another observa- 
<col>116</col>
tion of the hon. gent. (Mr. Whitbread) I will just notice. "All has been assertion," he says, "on our side, against facts proved on theirs" I did not expect this remark from the hon. gent. or from those who vote with him on this subject; for I contend, on the contrary, that the main facts on which the question depends have been asserted over and over again on their side, and never proved. I allude more particularly to their assertions, that the wars, and cruelties, and miseries of Africa, are caused by, and dependant upon, the European resort thither for slaves: and here I will not merely oppose assertion to assertion, but challenge investigation, and ask them where, if the proof they alledge exists, that proof may be found? In their pamplets and publications, though again and again they assume it as proved, I cannot find it, nor does the proof lie in the documents which have been produced on your table. They pretend to value facts only, and to disregard opinions; but opinions are not, in all instances, to be disregarded, nor are the authorities in mar statute-book to be treated with disrespect. I do confess, sir, that when a right hon. gent. (Mr. G. Rose) on the other side, produced a detailed account not only of till the acts, but of the proceedings of parliament, with the opinions of committees of this house, so decidedly and so repeatedly expressed upon the subject of the slave trade, illustrating and explaining, as he read it, the characters of those who introduced and sanctioned those proceedings, I did think that the accumulated authority thus concentrated and brought into a focus, was calculated to make some impression upon this house, and particularly upon its junior members, who might thence be induced to doubt and hesitate at least, and not to remain so confident in opinion as to treat with disregard, nay almost with contempt, the sentiments and arguments of those who yet adhere, with a lingering attachment, to the monuments of the wisdom of our ancestors, to the deliberate judgment of men, with whom I will not say that I would rather sometimes go wrong than always right with others, but of whom I will say that their talents and virtues have not been exceeded by those of their successors. Sir, it is impossible that we can pretend, that upon this subject they legislated in ignorance. The abuses of the slave trade were more flagrant at its commencement than in its progress. It began on the part of the English with acts of violence and rapine. Of those acts it is well known that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0074"/>
<col>117</col>
queen Elizabeth expressed her disapprobation; and in the year 1711, queen Anne, in recommending the subject to the attention of parliament, directs, that they shall enquire into the "nature of the trade." But are not the acts of parliament themselves, and their preambles, quite sufficient to prove that our ancestors were at variance with us in the first principles of the question? When they thought fit to encourage an "African slave trade," for the purpose of "supplying the West India colonies with slaves," was not this the whole of that proceeding, which we now pronounce to be ontrary to justice, humanity, and sound policy? Put the case merely thus, and say nothing of any circumstances not necessarily and indispensably connected either with the purchase of slaves in Africa, with their conveyance to the West Indies, or with their maintenance there as slaves on our plantations, and let me ask the young members who have heard the declamations which this debate has occasioned, whether here he not the sum and substance of that abominable crime which they are about to abolish? Our ancestors indeed distinguished betwixt the trade and its abuses: that they tolerated, these they reprobated; a sufficient proof of which is afforded by the act of 23 Geo. II. c. 31, which, in its preamble, authorises the trade and its application to the West Indies; but, in one of its provisions, enacts penalties upon its abuses&#x2014; abuses which it pronounces to be "to the prejudice of the said trade." It is in vain then for us to say that we are not completely at issue with our ancestors upon this question, or that we know any thing which they did not know, when they gave repeated legal sanction to that which we seek to abolish.&#x2014;There are also, sir, other opinions which I am inclined to treat with respect&#x2014;opinions founded upon facts and observations made in the midst of those very scenes of disgust and horror, which it is the professed object of this bill to prevent: and again let me ask those who have attentively listened to the pathetic representations made in the course of this debate, whether they can conceive it possible that two persons, neither slave traders nor West India proprietors, but impartial, enquiring travellers, should penetrate into the interior of Africa, be witnesses of what is passing there, and of the condition of its inhabitants, and yet come away, the one doubting whether an abolition of the slave trade would answer any good purpose, the other expressly disapproving that measure? What! live and
<col>118</col>
travel in Africa, and even doubt upon the subject? How is it possible? unless indeed it should prove that we at this distance from the scene are deceived by partial views of what, when regarded near and entire, wears another appearance, and produces another effect. Yet is it nevertheless true, that Bruce and Parke, their minds unprejudiced on the subject, or if biassed at all, experiencing a bias against the trade, have <ob/>eturned, the one from the East, the other from the west of the negro country; Parke intimating his doubts<sup>*</sup> whether the abolition of the trade would answer the views of its promoters; and Bruce, in the strongest terms, deprecating the measure.&#x2020;&#x2014;I have before mentioned, on the authority of Mr. Parke himself, that I believe his book to express, in this respect, his own sentiments, and not those of his editor, Mr. Bryan Edwards: and Mr. Edwards, sir, when he edited that book, was either an abolitionist, or at least wavering in his opinions. He was a man of much genius and ability; if his talents had been cultivated in another direction, he would probably have been an eminent poet or orator, but an orator, I think, rather excelling in the rhetorical than in the logical beauties of the art. He was, upon commercial subjects, and more particularly on the subject of the slave trade, of vacillating opinions; and the West India body, who always respected his abilities, could seldom depend upon the determinations of his judgement. When, in a former debate, I connected the statements of Parke with the comment with which Mr. Malthus has accompanied them, I expressly said (not knowing then that Mr. Malthus had published any opinion about the Slave Trade) that I was not able to say whether that gentleman was or was not a friend to abolition; but the principle he has advanced, and the reasoning he has introduced on this subject, remain unaltered; end when he states that the population of Africa is continually passing beyond the means of its subsistence, and that the condition of the negro nations will experience no amelioration until industry and security of property be introduced among them, these circumstances appear to me to bear strongly upon this question. I shall be told that industry and security of property cannot find their way into Africa until the Slave Trade be abolished; but those who look for an abo-

lition of the Slave Trade in Africa by a British act of parliament, seem to me to shut their eyes upon the lessons of history and experience.&#x2014;I will not travel over again the ground I have trodden. I have before stated my opinion, that the little information which we can glean of the state and condition of Africa, before the resort thither of Europeans for colonial labourers, has been either kept back or misrepresented in the publications of the abolitionists; and, when a right hon. gent. (Mr. Rose) alluded to what Leo Africanus relates to us concerning Negro Land, the hon. gent. (Mr. Wilberforce) who has interested himself so much in this question, appeared to me to promise us some comments upon the page of Leo. I shall not have an opportunity of observing upon what may fall from the hon. gent. on this subject, and I am not sure whether his usual ingenuity may not extract from Leo some passages which, in his opinion, favour his own views of the question; but I challenge him to contradict this result, that from the whole tenor of Leo's seventh book, which treats of the negro nations, it appears that before the resort of the Portuguese to the coast could have affected the condition of the interior, wars, both for dominion and plunder, originating as frequently, and from as slight provocations as they do now, were common throughout Negro Land; that the captives taken in those wars were either condemned to slavery, to imprisonment, or to death; that the condition of that slavery was in many instances most cruel and oppressive; that extensive markets for slaves were then open, and that to the Moors and to the eastern countries the sale of slaves was extensive; that in some instances the African Princes invited and even forced the Slave Trade, refusing to pay in gold for what they bought, and compelling the merchants, much against their will, to take slaves in return for their merchandize; and that slaves were at that day so plentiful, and horses for the purposes of war so valuable, that fifteen or twenty slaves were given for one horse. This I assert to be a fair abstract of what we gather from Leo, premising, however, that I am not able to read the original Arabian, nor have I ever met with the Italian translation made by Leo himself. I have, however, compared the Latin Elzevir translation with a French translation published at Lyons, in the sixteenth century, and they correspond in all essential respects. A voyager almost contem<ob/> orary with Leo, is. Cademosta, who in
<col>120</col>
speaking of the part of the African coast visited by him, tells us, that the negro nations are often at war, that they sell slaves to different nations, "and some to the Christians, since they began to trade with that country," evidently shewing, that when the Christians entered into the commerce, they found it already established and extensive.&#x2014;I build then, sir, my sentiments upon this question in part upon these authorities: and finding nothing in divine or human law which pronounces the possession, or the purchase, or the use of a slave, to be necessarily and invariably unjust, I cannot see either the obligation or the policy of abolishing that share of the Slave Trade which at present exists for the supply of our own colonies. If I were now to deliberate concerning any society, whether slavery should enter into its constitution, I should say; "Certainly not." If I were laying down regulations, and framing laws for an infant political establishment, I would take into my consideration all the original and abstract rights of man, for such rights do exist, and ought to be venerated, although they cannot often be applied with practical benefit to societies that have long existed under established laws. But we are not now in the case of debating whether our colonies shall or shall not be cultivated by slaves from Africa; they are and ever have been so cultivated; and we know at least that their prosperity has been hitherto dependant upon occasional supplies of the same description of imported population. All the rest is experiment merely, and theory, contradicted too by all that we know from fact and experience. When I before took occasion to observe the inconvenience of adopting in politics a rule so rigid that we would profit by nothing in this world that was connected with vice and abuse, the hon. gent. (Mr. Wilberforce) told me, that "this was ever our way; we wanted to let the Slave Trade pair off with some other tolerated crime." Sir, I do not find myself reduced to the miserable expedient of defending one abuse by another. I shewed how inapplicable these strict drawn rules must prove to the state of the world we live in, and that, if we would be rigidly bound by such principles, we must have neither lotteries nor alehouses; but I did not say that, consistently with the present condition and circumstances of this country, it was expedient that we should abolish either lotteries or alehouses: why then does the hon. gent. taunt me with the charge that I have not attempted to check those evils?
<image src="S1V0009P0I0076"/>
<col>121</col>
Why am I to be summoned to put on the armour of chivalry, and to mount my Rosinante in the hon. gent's suite? Sir, if I should ever sally out upon such adventures, and, stepping beyond the little circle of public or private life, wherein I may have it in my power to he useful, should undertake the reform of the world, I will not forget what is and has been the average state of human life: nor will I attempt to carry legislation beyond its fair and reasonable province.&#x2014;And now, sir, I Will look towards the West Indies; and here the hon. gent. (Mr. Wilberforce), attempts to pin me down to the statement of progressive population which I have found produced by himself and his friends, and which, believing it to be tolerably exact, I have contended did, when connected with the very moderate supply the islands would need, were they left unthreatened by this measure, prove, that the humane purposes of the Abolitionists were already attained, or in a fair way to be attained, without any violent proceeding. Oh! says the hon. gent., if you admit that, then without any importation, the increase by breeding will soon answer every purpose, except that of extending cultivation, and that is what we cannot encourage. Sir, I believe that the treatment of slaves has been improved by experience and mitigated by civilization; and admit, therefore, that the maintenance of the numbers by breeding may have been progressive to a certain degree; but this goes a very little way towards proving the policy of condemning our colonies to remain for ever without the possibility of an imported supply of population; for after this bill is passed, there is no remedy for any of those various events which are within the compass of possibility, and which may suddenly diminish their population. I have a right to say, that there is not any one in this house, who can at this time conjecture what and how many are the accidents which, in spite of humanity and vigilance, may contribute to the decrease of the negroes in our West India colonies, while, within a few leagues of them, a rival colony shall be flourishing and prosperous, unfettered by that eternal restriction which this bill will impose. A hurricane, and consequent famine, carried off, in Jamaica alone, 15,000 black inhabitants. Epidemics have occasionally prevailed, that have proved nearly as fatal; and, independantly of such accidents, there exists the inequality of sexes, bearing more or less hardly on individuals, and the impe-
<col>122</col>
diments which a laborious manufacture always opposes to population. The house has heard the result of the experience of an hon. gent. near me (Mr. Barham), whose humane endeavours to support his own numbers have hitherto proved ineffectual. My hon. friend (Mr. Ward), who spoke so ably on this question a few nights ago&#x2014; so ably, that this house must wish that he would more frequently take part in its debates&#x2014;and whose conviction on the subject I pretend not to say results from any partial view of the case, alluded to an estate which did support its numbers: that estate, sir, is most favourably circumstanced; it is insulated among the high lands of that district where it is placed, and the negroes cannot, without the utmost difficulty, indulge that rambling propensity which they bring with them from Africa, where polygamy is the law of the land. I could tell my hon. friend, that those who have constantly had the care and superintendance of that estate, have had also the care of others in the neighbourhood, to which they have extended exactly the same humane management; and that in no other instance have they found it possible to maintain the numbers without purchase&#x2014;I am enabled to state a case of peculiar hardship, in respect to an estate called Dean's Valley, in the parish of Westmoreland, Jamaica, which, from 329 negroes which it possessed in the year 1783, ill assorted as to sex, has sustained a gradual decay of its numbers, until, by the last return in the year 1806, the numbers were reduced to 166. This estate, for upwards of 20 years past, has been in a trust under will of the proprietor, who died in 1783;. and the trustees have not been at liberty to purchase a negro. As to the treatment of the negroes in this interval, those who know any thing of that island will rest satisfied, that there has been nothing wanting in humanity or provident care, when I state, that Mr. Mure has had the management of it, having, at the same time, the charge of Mr. Dehany's estates in that neigbourhood, where the numbers have been maintained, and the condition of the negroes generally cited as among the happiest in Jamaica. Sir, other cases of hardship may be stated, if necessary&#x2014;cases of minors and lessors of estates, who will take back their properties wholly or nearly destitute of labourers, and consequently incapable of being profitably cultivated, and to whom, even in the long interval in which this question has been under agitation, there has not been the power
<image src="S1V0009P0I0077"/>
<col>123</col>
or the ability to provide against the ruin which now awaits them. It has been said, you have had warning. Why have you not imported females and young people? As to the warning, sir, there was not till last year any concurrent decision of the two houses of parliament on this question: and as to the preferable importation of females, has that been at the discretion of the planter? An hon. and learned gent., (the Solicitor General), whose speech made a deep impression on the house, willing to prove that slavery prevailed in Africa in exact proportion with the demand for slaves, and that crimes were invented and forged whenever convicts were wanted, told you that if the planters should even say we will have none but women and children, women and children would be convicted and transported accordingly. Sir, I wish gentlemen would consider what would have been the feelings of the house, and what the tone of declamation that would have been excited, had such a fact been stated in evidence, as that of ships waiting upon the coast of Africa until they could be filled with women and children, because, forsooth, these were the description of slaves most saleable in the West Indies&#x2014;with what exclamations of horror would such a recital have been received! And because the fact does not exist; because the colonies have been obliged to receive such slaves, and such only, as the laws of Africa have suffered to be exported, is it now to constitute an additional charge against the planters, that they have not assorted the sexes, or imported such only as were best fitted for supporting the population?&#x2014;" When the condition of the slaves in the West India colonies is taken into consideration by the abolitionists, they first tells us that slavery bids defiance to law. "There are laws 'tis true," says the hon. member for Bedford, "but there are masters of slaves:" and we hear again and again, what cannot be denied, that laws made for a society consisting of a mixture of slaves and freemen, are not susceptible of the force and equal administration which laws have in a country of freemen only. Sir, nobody that I know of has pretended to prefer slavery to freedom, or to contest the point, that slavery does hardly admit of the complete controul of the law. Slavery has been mitigated, and must be mitigated, as civilization is extended. It is mitigated by manners, by opinions, and by examples. But, sir, when the full measure of censure has been poured upon us from this channel (be-
<col>124</col>
cause we found the colonies cultivated by slaves, and must continue so to cultivate them), was it to be expected that we should also be separately arraigned for the insufficiency of those laws, which, with better will than power perhaps, we have endeavoured to apply in regulating this state of society? Was it candid in the hon. and learned gent. (the Solicitor General) to cite, as an instance of West Indian barbarity, a law passed 120 years ago (the date of which he did not tell us till the question was put to him), and in which coarse expressions were found respecting slaves, when that learned gent. well knows that there exist, even in the statute-book of the British parliament (and I believe yet unrepealed), several acts, the provisions of which are a disgrace to humanity?&#x2014;Sir, the laws which have been passed for the protection of the negroes in the West Indies have not all proved dead letter; they have been enforced and executed in many instances, and they are at least evidences and records of the public opinion, by which the conduct of the whites in the West Indies is in a very considerable degree controlled; nor is it true that those laws, which breathe the mildest spirit, have been wrung from the colonists by the discussion of this question; it is well known that the consolidated slave law of Jamaica (the island which contains one half the slaves of our West India colonies) was passed previous to that discussion.&#x2014;While I contend, sir, that slavery has been mitigated by civilization, I must express a doubt whether civilization has equally tended to prevent abuses in societies of freemen governed by equal laws; and if a comparison be now drawn, as to the practical result in regard to the happiness of individuals, betwixt the one society and the other, I may assert that, of acts of cruelty and oppression which stain the character of those who commit, and increase the misery of those who suffer them, more instances occur in the cities of London and Westminster in one week, than in one month in the whole island of Jamaica.&#x2014;The hon gent. has somewhere alleged, that the circumstances of slaves often purchasing their freedom with the money they save, is an indisputable proof that they are miserable in a state of slavery. Sir, a slave, like an English labourer, looks upon a liberation from labour as his sovereign good. It does not follow that he is the happier for having attained it; but it is something to know that these ill-treated slaves do yet frequently save property enough wherewith to purchase their freedom.&#x2014;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0078"/>
<col>125</col>
Most sincerely do I wish that, respecting the treatment of negroes, either in one island or in one insulated district, an experiment had been made at the expense of government, and upon the maxims of the abolitionists, and that it might have been seen how tar the voluntary services of African negroes could have been obtained, and industry and happiness have been advantageously promoted, under a system essentially differing from that which prevails in our colonies. We should then have proceeded upon sound and safe principles, to innovate upon that which, however imperfect, has conduced hitherto to their prosperity.&#x2014;The hon. gent. will not admit my supposition that our needful supply (if the dread of abolition were removed) would become very trifling, in comparison with the numbers now in our islands; for he contends that we still desire slaves, for the purpose of extending our cultivation indefinitely, not recollecting how little likely it is that cultivation should be further extended, under the existing discouraging markets for produce; and I have not been surprised, sir, to hear, at the same time, the present distress of the West India trade urged as an argument in favour of the abolition. The abolition, says an hon. gent (Mr. Jacob), will prove a blessing to you, for it will lessen that produce of which you now import too much; while the hon. gent. (Mr. Wilberforce), opposite to me, who had been told by me, that, in opening the case of the West India trade, I should not think it necessary to allude in the most distant manner to this question, and who seemed to approve the distinction, did, upon that occasion, and when I could not reply to him, apply the whole of that case to this question, and expressed his satisfaction that the postponement of this debate had given him an opportunity of previously hearing our case stated, since now it must appear, that 'it was not to the Abolition of the Slave trade that could be imputed the distresses of the colonists.' Sir, I cannot so well answer these extraordinary arguments as by recalling to the memory of the house that there have been periods when, for two or three successive years, those useful and valuable establishments, the public breweries of this country, have been admitted to be unpro<ob/>table and even losing concerns; and we will suppose that in such circumstances the brewers had found it necessary to lay their case before parliament, requiring some legislative measure for their relief; what should we think of the states-
<col>126</col>
man, who, on such an occasion, should say, sell your drays and your horses, turn away your men, use less malt and hops, pay us less duty, and that will relieve you: or should some hon. gent. in this house, at such a moment, professing an anxiety to assist the brewers, have projected a measure which they believed would set their factories on fire, how consolatory must it be to them to hear him exclaim&#x2014;Well, I am glad I know your case, for now you cannot say that it is my projected measure which has occasioned your ruin! The distress of the West India colonies at this moment, sir, arises from their having complied with the urgent stimulation of the mother country, in furnishing her not only with produce amply sufficient for her own consumption, but also with a large surplus to enrich her by foreign trade; and, because the foreign market, not by their fault, is denied to the colonists, they ask you to support them under the burthen of producing what has been, and may again be, a most profitable resource to yourselves.&#x2014;On the political value of the colonies, and the intimate connection of their prosperity with our naval power, having on another occasion spoken, at some length, I will now be silent; and very shortly advert to the danger of insurrection in the islands connected with the present bill. Sir, I do not desire to look on the gloomy side, and will hope that our colonies may not undergo the rapid fate of Saint Domingo; but I cannot forbear to notice what we have heard upon high authority, that the people of France do connect the revolution in Saint Domingo with the abolition of the slave trade. The noble lord (Lauderdale) who, in the course of the late negociation, was thus informed, is said to have replied, that he believed otherwise. I respect much, sir, the manly understanding of that noble lord, but cannot consider his opinion on this subject as of equal value with that generally diffused over the French nation, who witnessed the whole course of that dreadful event, who knew the pains taken by the Amis des Noirs to spread their doctrines in the colonies, and who read the twopenny and threepenny publications, which there too teemed from the press, inviting the negroes "to break their chains upon the heads of their oppressors." Expressions equally inflammatory I could shew the noble lord (Howick) who sits on the bench before me, in the pamphlets which have been circulated here, although I doubt not that his mind has never been sullied by
<image src="S1V0009P0I0079"/>
<col>127</col>
the perusal of them, and that he therefore thought an allusion which I made to them upon a former clay less justifiable than it really was. Sir, it is not the debates of this house (of which we are charged with permitting the circulation in the colonies) that are so much calculated to impress the mind of the negro, as an act of legislation, the operation of which he will immediately see, and the grounds and motives of which he will then naturally make the objects of his enquiry.&#x2014;This, sir, I think is the proper moment for my acknowledging that protection to our characters, which some hon. gents have thought fit to interpose against the abuse which others have so copiously bestowed upon us. I have, sir, carefully estimated the amount of that protection, and I think it is this: 'these West India planters and merchants,' say they, 'are, for aught we know, anatomically constructed, much like other people; they have a scull, a brain, a pia and a dura mater, like ourselves; but man is the creature of habit, and their habits are detestably bad. Their early associations fill their minds with inveterate prejudices, which prevent them either from understanding or feeling like the rest of the world: but then let us not be too severe upon them; for were we ourselves (lord H. Petty, Mr. Canning) exposed to similar impressions, which thank God we are not! our opinions and conduct might be just like theirs.' I do not know how others may feel on this subject, sir, but I for one desire not to put the gentlemen to this expence of reluctant liberality, to exact from them this tribute of left-handed candour. All that in our defence and justification I would ask of them is, that when they have torn out of the statute-book the acts of one hundred and fifty years, and scattered them upon the floor, they would permit us, humble gleaners, to collect and to carry home with us the fragments; we will treasure up the preambles and provisions which they have contemptuously rejected, and those shall be our justification: for the rest, let them leave us to God and to our own consciences; but if we ask them not to trouble themselves about our defence, let them recollect, that upon the subject of the slave trade it ill becomes a member of the parliament of Great Britain to stigmatize the instruments which that legislature has deluded into a crime (if we are so to call it), of which the nation has pocketted the gains.&#x2014;I am here led to advert to that compensation which is due, as I think, to those whose properties this bill
<col>128</col>
may injure or destroy, and for which there is, within the bill, no provision, nor has there been any thing like a distinct pledge given. On the contrary, the opportunity of discussing the justice or expediency of such a provision has not occurred, his Majesty's ministers having declared themselves not authorised to express the royal permission for entertaining the question. I had the highest direction in this house, your own, sir, for declining, in merely asking his Majesty's ministers for that permission, to go at length into the general argument; and I am driven now into the necessity of urging what I have to say on the subject as an objection to this bill, which cannot, as I contend, without some such qualification, be reconciled with that regard for justice and for property, which is the acknowledged attribute of a British house of commons: and here I have a right to call upon those for their support, who may be, in all other respects, friends to this bill, but who have invariably maintained that it ought to pass, accompanied with a liberal pledge of compensation to those whose property, hitherto protected by the laws, may he injured by its enactments. I have more particularly a right to expect such support from gentlemen connected with the colonies, and friends of abolition, but who must yet be well aware of the partial injuries it will inflict, and who will not, I trust, vote for this bill, since it contains no pledge of protection to those who may innocently suffer by its operation. Sir, it was objected to me, when I attempted to introduce this question to the house, that it was not the usage of parliament in similar great public regulations, to provide compensation prospectively. But there is the act of 28 Geo. III. cap. 54, which stares us in the face, in direct contradiction to this assertion: that act relates to the regulation of the slave trade on the coast of Africa. It is not my business to make distinctions betwixt the African and West Indian slave trades, but the former is not the part of the trade for which parliament has ever expressed a predilection, and yet, in the 15th section of the act I have mentioned, there is a large and liberal provision of compensation, not merely for property taken away, but for losses to be sustained. How, let me ask, did such a clause find its way into that bill? His Majesty's approbation for the consideration of the subject was certainly first obtained, and then the house did, upon deliberation, see the policy and the justice of admitting that provision. Why then, in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0080"/>
<col>129</col>
the name of justice, has even a deliberation upon the question, as applied to this bill, been denied to us? We are assured that we shall sustain no injury, and, on the contrary, that the colonies are to be greatly benefited by the abolition. Are they sincere who advance this opinion (Messrs. Wilberforce, Jacob, &amp;c. &amp;c.)? Then, sir, at how cheap a rate might they, in this instance, have the grace of relieving apprehensions, of removing objections, and of connecting a measure certainly of innovation and violence with a display of uniform and consistent justice! But, on the other hand, we are told, take care how you admit any consideration of compensation, for the whole revenue of England might not suffice for the claims it would occasion. Are they sincere who advance this opinion (Mr. Whitbread)? Then how cautious should we be of incurring a loss of such magnitude, that the whole revenue of the country may be too little to make it good. l am aware that those who maintain this last opinion have alledged, that compensation may be demanded for voluntary and exaggerated losses, and for a sacrifice of extravagantly computed prospective profits. Sir, there could be no such dangers incurred under a clause wisely restricted to real and substantial losses&#x2014;a clause framed with reference to precedents that already exist in the statute-book, and expressed in terms of additional precaution, suggested by the present case. Is it pretended, sir, that this bill can operate without unmerited injury to individuals? or does the house adopt the sentiments which I heard, with the utmost surprise, fall from an hon. baronet?&#x2014;sentiments which did appear to me so extraordinary and objectionable, that I cannot express myself freely concerning them, unless the hon. baronet (sir P. Francis) be present. And now, sir, seeing him present, I shall state what I understood him to pronounce as his deliberate opinion (referring not to slave traders on the coast of Africa, but to the West India planters and merchants); and if I heard him right, it was, that no person who had been concerned in a trade which parliament has recently declared to be contrary to justice, humanity, and sound policy, can, in respect of losses sustained in that trade, make out to parliament a case that ought to be heard for compensation. The hon. baronet thus puts out of the protection of the law a large class of British subjects, who can plead a long series of ancient statutes as their authority, and whose claim is precisely founded on the re-
<col>130</col>
versal of those statutes. Understanding this to be the hon. baronet's opinion (he will correct me if I have mistaken it), I must say, that it is an opinion repugnant to every principle of justice, humanity, and sound policy.&#x2014;One ill effect that must result from passing the bill, thus unqualified, we shall surely experience, in the discouragement it will cast upon the commercial spirit of the country. What have merchant adventurers to trust to but written laws? They cannot call into question whether the legislators who passed those laws were more or less well informed, and had or had not the fullest lights upon the subject. Sir, twenty-five or thirty years ago, when I commenced merchant, had I canvassed both houses of parliament for an opinion how a mercantile capital could be adventured in foreign commerce the most advantageously to the public, nine out of every ten would have advised me to embark it upon the cultivation of the colonies; and in this reign two acts have been passed, encouraging loans, one from British subjects and one from foreigners, for that purpose; and yet, in this very reign, the security of those who lent money in faith of those acts, is, without compensation, to be violated; for an estate that may be at any time cultivated by the purchase of negroes (whether more or less of that description be now upon it) is, in the West India colonies, a valid security; but land deprived of that privilege and use, is not so. I cannot, sir, but look with despondency to the effect this example must have upon commercial confidence and credit. You will still, I doubt not, have your loan contractors, your lottery contractors, your barrack contractors, and the swarms that hang upon your revenue departments may increase perhaps as the matter they have to feed upon will diminish; but the ardent and adventurous spirit which has created and sustained the commercial character of this country, which has 'raised other fruits beneath another sun,' and rendered every quarter of the world the theatre of British industry, and the source of British wealth, can exist only under an uniform and consistent protection from the legislature, and, wanting that, must expire.&#x2014;I have, sir, now only a few words to address to my hon. friends connected with the colonies, who have given their support to this bill. Let me ask them what is their situation before it passes, and what will be their situation when it is passed? They have now a long series of legislative authorities to refer to, in support of those establishments and
<image src="S1V0009P0I0081"/>
<col>131</col>
that cultivation on which their property has been embarked. To-morrow those establishments, and that cultivation, will be as it were under an interdict, and as reprobated by the legislature. My hon. friends have, I know, taken up their opinions on conviction, and have rejected with scorn that adulation which has been offered to them, as of a distinct character and class from their fellow colonists. If they could possibly have felt any complacency in that distinction, they must know that to-morrow that too will lose its value. My hon, friends will not believe that I speak my own sentiments, for I acknowledge no guilt imputable to any of us; but those who call us all guilty may look upon them as <i>participes criminis,</i> useful while retained as evidences, or detached from their accomplices, but, when the cause is over, subject to the indifference, not to use a stronger term, which generally attends that description of persons. Are my hon. friends flattering themselves (I know that some of them have so done) that here the matter ends, and that, in future, the colonist will enjoy his property without molestation? Have they not heard, sir, is not the alarm-bell of further innovation yet ringing in their ears, have they not heard a young nobleman, of great hope, and of the highest connections in this country, announce a measure tending directly to emancipation? That young nobleman will be treated like a gallant soldier who outsteps the line, and anticipates the charge; but the line is advancing, and the charge will soon be made. Where then will my honorable friends take their stand? Are they pledged to go all lengths, or are they, by a late hesitation and repentance, to lose the merit of their former concessions? Had they not better, even if they object not to this bill, lay hold of the laws which have hitherto protected them, and demand compensation at least, as the condition of their passive concurrence? they will soon find themselves undistinguished from us who have from the first withstood these innovations&#x2014;undistinguished, excepting by the bitter consciousness of having been aiding and consenting to their own destruction; and they must be contented with us to walk through the empire with a brand upon their backs; if they enjoy a short prosperity, it will be a prosperity blasted by obloquy and reproach; if they fall, on the contrary, as I believe they will, they will fall unpitied and unprotected.&#x2014;Sir, if in what I have said I have expressed myself at any time with un-
<col>132</col>
becoming warmth, I shall to-morrow be sorry for it; the house will, I trust, regard it as the effort of an expiring flame, the spasm before dissolution. Believing, as in sincerity and sobriety I do, that if this bill pass, it condemns the colonies to a decay more or less rapid, I could not bring myself to say less in justification of the opposition I have given, and must continue to give to it; but, sir, I have done, and cannot foresee that I shall again at any time have to trouble the house on this subject, unless it chance that on the one hand consequences I do not now look for should demand from me retraction or concessions, which shall, in that case, be freely made before they are called for, or that I should, on the other hand, be compelled to submit to the house cases of individual distress and injury originating in this bill, and humbly praying for compensation; should this last, sir, be my let, and should even the worst I have contemplated come to pass, I shall not think that the language of reproach will avail any thing under such circumstances, neither will I (and for this the hon. gent, whom I oppose ought to thank me) at that time undertake their defence and justification. I will not say that I knew many of these abolitionists who, with the exception of their prejudices on this subject, were much like other men; and that, had I been, as, thank God I was not, like them, misled by delusive theories, deceived by false, exaggerated, or partial accounts of what has passed, and is passing in Africa and the West Indies; instigated by popular clamour (itself artificially and enthusiastically excited); and fascinated by oratory, I might with them, have given my voice for a measure which has proved destructive of its object, and has sacrificed one main source of our national prosperity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Philip Francis</member> <membercontribution>had never said, that the persons engaged in the slave trade were out of the protection of the law. What he had stated on a former night was, that he would not be a party to any proceeding of that house, which should pledge to any compensation for any future losses that might arise front any measure under discussion. He had asserted that, on general principles, them could be no claim for losses sustained by a transaction which the house had declared to be contrary to justice, humanity, and policy; and he still adhered to that opinion. He had gone further with respect to Trinidad; for that was a modern establishment, and the speculations had been undertaken in that island, with a knowledge of the resolution
<image src="S1V0009P0I0082"/>
<col>133</col>
of parliament of 1792, that the trade should be abolished after a certain time. He should feel it his duty to resist any application from that island, at the same time that he would be as ready as any hon. member to grant compensation for losses which might be sustained by the operation of the bill, upon t special case being made out.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lytleton </member>, <membercontribution>though he had not the presumption to suppose that he could place the arguments that had already been employed in the different stages of this measure in a stronger light, or a more persuasive form, could not yet content himself with giving a silent vote upon this occasion. The slave trade was so enormous and horrible, that there was no parallel to it in the annals of the world. He was glad that the measure of its abolition was at length arrived at its last stage; though he was sorry that any alteration had been made in the preamble, because he could not reconcile to himself any compromise upon the subject. He was convinced that none of the imputed consequences would follow from the adoption of the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Henry Thornton</member> <membercontribution>observed, that it did not signify to the house what Leo Africanus or Mr. Park might have thought of the slave trade, as they were themselves more competent to decide upon the facts before them. In a communication which he had with Mr. Park, however, that gentleman, though he studiously avoided giving any decisive opinion as to the effects of the abolition of the slave trade, admitted that the justice of such a measure did not allow of an argument. This measure would not only throw wide open the doors of civilization for Africa, but lay the first stone for the establishment of the happiness of the West Indies. As this country was the balance for the great power on the continent, they ought to attend to the grounds upon which its means were founded, and particularly in its colonies. Measures were to be taken for the improvement of the condition of the mass of the people in the sister kingdom; an hon. gent. of great weight in that house (Mr. Whitbread) from his character and talents, had brought forward measures for the improvement of the mass of the people in this country; measures had on a former occasion been taken to correct abuses which were said to have existed in the East Indies; and he would ask, whether it was not right that they should take measures for the improvement of the West India islands? He had paid particular attention to the case of the slaves, and he agreed that the system was more severe. than any
<col>134</col>
that had ever existed in the world. The slave was called to work half an hour before sun rise, and was dismissed from work half an hour after sun set, and this period of labour, with the intermission of two hours in the course of the day, was greater than could be borne in a tropical climate. They were besides worked under the whip, a practice which had never obtained in any years; and men, and boys, and girls of tender age, and women in an advanced stage of pregnancy, were subjected to blows at the discretion of the driver. The slavery in the West Indies was touch more severe than in the ancient world; for shortly after the propagation of christianity, slavery was done away. Here the hon. member read an extract from the historian Gibbon, to shew that, when the sources of procuring slaves were cut off by the union of Asia and Africa with the Roman empire, the Romans obtained them by the more tedious method of propagation, which was promoted by mild treatment, and encouraging marriage. These were the facts upon which the advocates of the bill supported it. But it would likewise have the effect of promoting the civilization of Africa, which was shut out at present from every side of the coast. This measure would place both Africa and the West Indies in a better condition, and have the effect of putting an end to the wars, crimes, and kidnappings, which were resorted to in Africa to obtain slaves. Of all the slaves that were brought from that country, not one was taken upon just grounds; but the instances were numberless of those taken by fraud and criminal artifices. He considered the trade as a crime, and in abolishing it, the house was performing a primary duty; the first duty of parliament being to provide for the freedom of the subject, and that no man should receive injury from another. After a few observations on the Sierra Leone establishment, the hon. member concluded by giving his hearty support to the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Captain Herbert</member> <membercontribution>thought the measure fraught with ruin to the colonies and the commercial prosperity of the country. He complained of the style of declamation and common-place expressions of justice and humanity, generally delivered with munch eloquence, with which this measure had been supported. It was foolish, if not blasphemous, for them to graft on their theories the character of the dispensations of Divine Providence. They ought to consider the good that this measure might do to Africa, and the evil it might do to ourselves, and, having
<image src="S1V0009P0I0083"/>
<col>135</col>
compared the quantity of good and evil that might result from it, if the former should preponderate, to consider whether this was a moment at which they could afford to encounter so much evil. If this country were to withdraw its capital from the slave trade, our enemies would be enabled to carry it on upon better terms, because the price of the slave would be lower on the coast. But the Trans-Atlantic market was but a small part of the slave market. The empire of Morocco, and tile great empires in the interior of Africa, took off the greatest portion of them. If he thought that there existed the cruelties alledged in the treatment of the slaves, he should not oppose the measure. But he had been in all our West India colonies, in all the islands belonging to other nations, and he thought the condition of the labourers in the West Indies as happy as that of the peasantry in any nation of Europe. The sway of the whites was mild, but the tyranny of the blacks was really a whip of scorpions. If this bill were to be passed, the emancipation would follow. He had been in the empire of Hayti, and conversed with all classes from the field negro to the field officer, and he could assert, that they had not wished for liberty when it was offered to them, but preferred the mild government of the whites to the severe oppression of the blacks.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. T. W. Plummer</member> <membercontribution>was as much an advocate for liberty as any man, but thought it very dangerous to propagate such an idea among the unenlightened negroes. It war to be recollected how much Great Britain bad already lost in her colonial strength, by the discussion of these abstract principles; to that she owed the revolt and loss of her American colonies, and it behoved her to be aware of propagating notions of political right among a people so unintelligent and so easily provoked to revolt as the negroes. With regard to the supply of negroes to the colonies, as it appeared on all hands at least questionable point, that the negro population could be kept up without any farther importation, he recommended rather a suspension of the trade than a total abolition, in order that an experiment might be fairly made upon this important question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>said, that the total time of labour was only ten hours. The whip of driver was never used, though it was formerly; and it was no more used now than the mace was to knock down members in the lobby. Neither the drivers nor white servants had power to punish without consent of the masters. The negroes preferred the
<col>136</col>
ordinary mode of labour to lashes, as he himself had found by experience. He positively asserted, that when women were pregnant all idea of labour was at an end. His negroes had brought him, on a fear of scarcity, about a thousand pounds in gold; which was a proof that negroes had, in general, not been so harshly treated as had been apprehended.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Thornton</member> <membercontribution>still maintained that he was correct in the points he had stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Windham </member> <membercontribution>remarked, that although the overseers of plantations made use of the whip, that did not prove that the negroes were treated with cruelty; but, alter all, it was not the intention of the house to abolish slavery, but the slave trade. Therefore, when the anti-abolitionists spoke of the miserable condition of the slaves, they were arguing against themselves, inasmuch as it was no part of the present bill to abolish slavery in the West Indies. Slavery was as ancient as the days of Homer, who said, take from a man his liberty, and you take from him his virtue. Still slavery was a degrading situation for man, and it was to be wished that it could be abolished. Slavery, however, differed very much, as to degree, in different countries; and he could not but believe, upon the testimony adduced, that the authority exercised over the negroes in the West Indies was much less than in most other countries where slavery existed at all. But even if this measure were carried, slavery would continue in the West Indies; and those advocates for the measure were not consistent with themselves, who argued from principles of strict right and justice in favour of the present measure, and yet did not follow up their own principles, by emancipating the present slaves in the West Indies. The right hon. secretary proceeded to observe, that on such a question, the house ought not to go upon abstract principles of right, but upon the consideration of the consequences of the measure, and the possible ruin of the British empire resulting from it. As to Africa, this measure would produce no benefit to that country, for there would not be less slavery after our abolishing the trade than before it: in the West Indies it would tend to produce discontent among the negroes; to individuals it would be a great loss and injustice, and would prove ruinous to numbers who had a claim to the protection of this country. France and other rival nations would most probably refuse to imitate our example, and would redouble this traffic to our ruin. Nor was this a time
<image src="S1V0009P0I0084"/>
<col>137</col>
to venture such an experiment. We were engaged in a dangerous war with a powerful enemy. Was it not also a time to be strictly economical? Were they not called to attend to candle ends and cheese parings? And, at such a time, should parliament think of throwing away such a resource as the West India islands? Did they not see empire after empire tumbling like so many nine pins all around them? He knew there were some of hon. friends who would tell him the present measure tended to security against such dangers. He wished it might, but he feared it. If this question was one of feeling merely, all their feelings must be alike; but he deprecated their feelings running away with their better judgment. Ii was not true that parliament was about to abolish the slave trade; they were only abolishing their share in it; and it was even doubtful, if, after all, this measure would, in any degree, diminish the traffic in slaves on the coast of Africa. He wished his forebodings and fears might go no farther; but, at any rate, he must renounce the honour and glory of effecting a measure which would be productive, as some gentlemen expected, of such salutary effects; as the same time, disclaiming any share in the pernicious consequences, which, to his apprehension, were much more likely to accrue from its adoption.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>replied to his right hon. friend, who, in saying that the same arguments which applied to the abolition of the slave trade, also applied to the abolition of slavery, had blended two things which ought to be kept distinct. The one was in our power, the other was in our hope, but not at present in our power. With respect to the treatment of slaves in the West Indies, he wanted no testimony on that subject. Despotism must lead to cruelty. As in the words of Shakespeare, "Mercy is twice blest, it blesseth him that gives, and him that takes;" so despotism was twice cursed. It cursed him that exercised it, and him on whom it was exercised. He trusted, therefore, that the present measure was the preamble of the future; but at the same time he was aware that the ultimate step must I taken with the utmost tenderness, caution and deliberation. To give immediate freedom to men who had always been accustomed to slavery, would be productive of the most serious consequences. With regard to the wealth derived from the West Indies, we had paid for it more than "human sinew bought and sold" ever produced to this coun-
<col>138</col>
try. He painted in strong colours the morality which took place among our troops in the West Indies, and contended, that if we could recover all our brave countrymen who had been sacrificed in that country, they, would be cheaply purchased by the relinquishment of all the riches which had flowed from it. He ridiculed the idea of the colonies quitting the protection of Britain; they had too much good sense to take such a rash step; for they must well know, that as we were masters of the sea, we must also be masters of the soil. Nor did he apprehend that the abolition of the slave trade would cause any insurrection among the blacks. Had it not been in agitation for 20 years, and had there been the least ferment among them in consequence? After a warm panegyric on his late right hon. friend (Mr. Fox), who had the abolition ever at heart; and on his hon. friend (Mr. Wilberforce), by whose unwearied exertions the question had at length been brought to a successful termination, he concluded by declaring, that he had never given a vote with more heartfelt satisfaction than that which he should give on the motion before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>lamented his difference in opinion from his hon. friend (Mr Wilberforce). However the right hon. gent. who had just sat down, might, by the superior brilliancy of his genius and ingenuity of argument, disguise the question, it was possible that the measure now before the house could ever accomplish what the liberal mind of his hon. friend had for so many years in contemplation. The only result would be, that perhaps the attachment to the mother country would be a little shaken, the people in our West India colonies might be driven to import contrary to the wish and order of parliament, end the number of deaths would most probably be increased.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>called most seriously the attention of the house to the point to which the question was now brought. They had for the present no object immediately before them, but that of putting a stop directly to the carrying men in British ships to be sold as slaves in the British islands in the West Indies. If that measure was to be shortly carried into execution, he should think that his labour for these 19 years past would be amply rewarded: but still, he must confess, that he should have another object after that in view, and that he looked forward to a still more happy change in the state of the negroes in the West India islands. According to the plain rules of common sense, his logi-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0085"/>
<col>139</col>
cal friend on the other side of the house (Mr. Windham) must be in error; we were not to say that because a man had two wounds we should refrain from curing one, because it was not in our power to heal up both the wounds immediately. The right hon. gent. must see, without entering into any metaphysical discussion, that the great Author of our being had ordained, that the duty and happiness of mankind should be closely connected. It was our duty to put a stop as speedily as possible to the traffic and sale of our fellow men; and notwithstanding the forebodings of the noble lord (Castlereagh), he had reason to hope that we should have the happiness to see that smuggling would be as easily prevented in that as in any article that was at present attempted to be dealt in contrary to law. He thought it to be an act of duty towards the many great and enlightened statesmen that had supported him in the accomplishing of this object which he had most dearly at heart, to acknowledge the liberality with which they had set aside all lesser differences, and united their efforts with this great measure, for promoting the happiness of mankind. The chearfulness with which it was supported by most of the leading members of the present administration, he hoped was a favourable omen of what might be expected from them at any time hereafter, witch questions were to be decided on the great and immutable principles of truth, justice, and humanity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham </member>, <membercontribution>stated, in explanation, that his opinions on this question had been uniformly guided by the authority of Mr. Burke, who had entertained an idea of the gradual abolition of slavery, and of course of the slave trade, in a manner totally different from that proposed by the present measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the right hon. gent. had never mentioned the name of Mr. Burke in his speech, and therefore had no right to shelter himself under his authority. The plan the right hon. gent. had alluded to, he had often requested to see, and could never obtain a sight of. This, however, he could aver, that Mr. Burka had often stated both in private and in that house, to him and to many others, that he had abandoned his former ideas on the subject, and thought exactly as they did.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham </member> <membercontribution>appealed to the house, whether he had not quoted the authority of Mr. Burke.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham </member> <membercontribution>stated that the plan of Mr. Burke had been put into his hands, for the purpose of his making sonic observations in

his place upon it.&#x2014;The question was then loudly called for, when the gallery was cleared, but the bill was read a third time and passed without a division.</membercontribution></p>

A reduction in the rate of duty on British plantation sugar: 2. That liberty be given to the colonies to barter sugar and coffee, as well as rum and molasses, with the American states, in return for lumber and other necessaries, for a needful supply of which the colonies depend on an intercourse with those states: 3.

II. cap. 2, commonly called the Test act, and of granting to persons of all religious persuasions an unrestrained admission into situations even of the highest naval and military command; and that the petitioners see much reason to apprehend that the said bill, if it should pass into a law, may lead to the removal also of every similar restraint in matters of civil concern, and to the abrogation of all

those oaths, declarations, and tests; which are now required by law of persons admitted into offices and stations of civil trust and authority; and that the petitioners do verily believe, all these restraints and obligations, whether they have respect to employments of a civil or a naval and military nature, to be no other nor greater than are indispensably requisite for the maintenance and security of the monarchy and the church, as they are now happily established in this united kingdom; and therefore praying, that the above-mentioned bill may not pass into a law; and that the house in its wisdom will be pleased still to maintain and preserve inviolate those laws, which experience has proved to be the best safe-guards, under divine providence, of our present happy constitution both in church and state."

<p><member>[ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.] Earl Percy rose</member> <membercontribution>in pursuance of the notice he had given to move for leave to bring in a bill for the gradual abolition of slavery in his majesty's colonies in the West Indies. His lordship expatiated feelingly on the wanton cruelties exercised on the unhappy negroes in the plantations, as developed in the late discussions. The object of his bill was to prevent the repetition of horrors, at the very idea of which every man in that house must shudder. If it had been established, as he trusted it had been established, that the slave trade was contrary to the principles of justice, humanity and sound policy, and that therefore it ought to be abolished; it necessarily followed, that slavery itself was contrary to the principles of justice, humanity and sound policy, and ought also to be abolished. It was, however, by no means his intention to propose any immediate abolition; what he had in view was, that the children of slaves born after a certain time to be fixed by the legislature, should be free; and thus a gradual and ultimately a total extinction of this barbarous usage would takes place. His lordship concluded with moving" That leave be given to bring in a bill, for the gradual abolition of slavery in his majesty's colonies in the West Indies." On the question being put.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty </member>, <membercontribution>although it was possible for him not to respect the motives and participate in the feelings of his noble friend, yet deprecated any discussion of this subject at the present moment. The abolition of the slave trade, and emancipation of the slaves, were two distinct questions;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0087"/>
<col>143</col>
and it had also been maintained by the leading characters in that house, that, in considering the one, the other ought to be excluded from their contemplation. To emancipate the negroes, would not be to add to their happiness, even if the legislature had a right to interfere with the property of the colonies. All that could be done by this country with safety and effect had already been done. He put it, therefore, most respectfully, but most strongly, to his noble friend, either to withdraw the motion for a bill to abolish slavery, or to concur in the previous question, which he felt it to be his duty to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Eden</member> <membercontribution>said, that in all great and important questions time was given for the parties, whose interests were affected, to petition against the measure. The present motion was precipitate, and precluded the parties from that opportunity. He would also ask, was the noble lord or any one else prepared to offer any remuneration to the colonists, if they should be deprived of the services of the slaves and their children? This was a measure which would be fraught with ruin to the colonists, and should therefore have his decided opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir C. Pole </member>,<membercontribution> while he deprecated the motion as fraught with the most dangerous consequences, said, he rejoiced that it had been brought forward thus early, because it shewed the cloven foot, which had been attempted to be concealed: he believed that this was one main object in view by the abolitionists. It was fraught with much evil, and he trusted it would open the eyes of the public, to the intentions of the promoters of those measures.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce </member>, <membercontribution>had the motion proceeded from a less respectable quarter, would have been as glad as the hon. baronet that it had been made, because it would shew that he (Mr. W.), and those who thought with him, made the distinction between the abolition of the trade and the emancipation of the slaves, and not only abstained from proposing the latter, but were ready to reject such a proposition when made by others. How much soever he looked forward with anxious expectation to the period when the negroes might with safety be liberated; he knew too well the effect which the long continuance of abject slavery produced upon the human mind, to think of their immediate emancipation; a measure, which, at the present moment, would be injurious to them, and ruinous to the colonies. He, and those who acted with him, were satisfied
<col>144</col>
with having gained an object which was safely attainable; they had always declared what he now repeated, that the sole point which they had in view was, the abolition of the slave trade, and not of the emancipation of the slaves. The enemies of the abolition had always confounded these two objects; the friends of the abolition had always distinguished them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Captain Herbert</member> <membercontribution>deprecated any discussion on this subject. If a hope remained that the colonies might be saved, the only mode of realizing that hope, would be by shewing that the house would not for a moment admit the proposal for emancipation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan </member>, <membercontribution>after the anxious expectation which he had last night expressed, that the bill then passed was but the preamble of the ultimate measure of emancipation, thought that he should be guilty of the grossest inconsistency in giving a silent vote on the present question. With these sentiments he need scarcely say, that the noble earl had his thanks for having directed the attention of the house to this important subject, even at that early period. The noble earl's statement had been misrepresented. He had never proposed to enfranchise the living negroes; his measure, as he understood him, was to commence with infants born after a period, which would remain a matter of future parliamentary discussion. The planters were entitled to fair dealing on this subject. If the house meant to say, that by abolishing the slave trade they had done all that duty demanded, and that they would leave the emancipation of the slaves to the hazard of fortuitous circumstances, let them be explicit, and say so; but if there lurked in any man's mind a secret desire to proceed in that business, a secret conviction that more ought to be done than had been done, it was unmanly, it was dishonourable, not to speak out. For one, he would boldly declare that he had further views; he hoped, that the young nobleman who had done his feelings so much credit, by the proposition which he that evening made, would stand to his ground. If he persevered in the pursuit of his object with the same zeal as his Hon. friend (Mr. Wilberforce) had done, he had no doubt that he would meet with the same success An hon bart. had talked of a cloven foot; he pleaded guilty to the cloven foot, but he would say that of the man who expressed pleasure at the hope of seeing so large a portion of the human race freed from the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0088"/>
<col>145</col>
Shackles of tyranny, it ought rather to be said, that he had displayed the pinion of an angel than the cloven foot of a demon. It was true no immediate connection existed between the abolition of the Slave trade and the abolition of Slavery, but the same feelings must be roused by the consideration of both questions; and he who detested the one practice, must also detest the other. He did not like to hear the term property applied to the subjects of a free country. Could man become the property of man? A colony emanating from the free constitution of England must carry with it the principles of that constitution, and could no more shake off its well-known allegiance to the constitution than it could shake off its allegiance to the sovereign. He trusted that the planters might he induced to lead the way on the subject of emancipation; but he cautioned the house against being too sanguine on this subject. Were the planters themselves always resident on the islands, he should have greater hopes; but it was not probable that because cargoes of human misery were no longer to be landed on their shores, that because their eyes were to be no longer glutted with the sight of human suffering, or their ears pierced with the cries of human distraction in any further importation of negroes, that the slave-drivers would soon forget their fixed habits of brutality, and learn to treat the unhappy wretches in their charge with clemency and compassion. Slavery would not wear itself out; it would become more rigid, unless the legislature became more vigilant, and reminded the planters of the new duty that had fallen upon them, of rearing the young slaves in such a manner, that they might be worthy of freedom. Adverting to a quotation from the historian Gibbon, he contended, that the slavery of the West Indies was unlike any other slavery; it was peculiarly unlike the slavery of ancient days, when the slaves frequently attained to the highest dignities. Esop, Terence, and Seneca were slaves. Was there a possibility that any of the unfortunate negroes now in the West Indies should emulate such men? It might be dangerous to give freedom to the slaves in a mass, but that it was not dangerous to give it to them in detail, was sufficiently proved by a little pamphlet that had been put into his hands the preceding night, in which it was stated, that a Mr. David Barclay, to his eternal honour be it spoken, who had himself been a slave owner in Jamaica, and who, regretting that
<col>146</col>
he had been so, on a bequest of slaves being made to him, emancipated them, caused them to be conveyed to Pennsylvania, where they were properly instructed, and where their subsequent exemplary conduct was the general theme of admiration. With this fact before him, should he be told that he must give up all hope of abolishing slavery? No, he would never give it up. He would exclaim with the Poet, in the words of the motto of the pamphlet which he had mentioned,
<quote>"I would not have a slave to till my ground,</quote>
<quote>"To carry me, to fan me when I sleep,</quote>
<quote>And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth</quote>
<quote>That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, denied ever having disavowed his wish that freedom should ultimately be communicated to the slaves. He had deprecated the discussion at present, because he looked to the gradual improvement of their minds, and to the diffusion among them of those domestic charities which would render them more fit, than he feared they now were, to bear emancipation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Peter Moore </member>, <membercontribution>however strongly he had advocated the abolition, was against immediate emancipation. The abolition would ameliorate the condition of the slaves, by forcing the West India planters to treat them well, and they would ultimately be prepared to receive freedom. He hoped the noble lord would withdraw his motion, that he would turn his mind to the object with deliberation, and look at it remotely.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[SLAVE TRADE ABOLITION BILL.] Mr. Wilberforce</member>, <membercontribution>lord Howick, and several members of the house of commons, brought up the Slave Trade Abolition bill, agreed to with amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>called the attention of the house to this subject, which he considered one of the most important that could occupy the attention of their lordships. With respect to the amendments made in this bill, he was satisfied they were calculated to carry its principles better into effect. It was, however, necessary, that time should be given for consideration, and he therefore moved that the bill, with the amend
<image src="S1V0009P0I0089"/>
<col>147</col>
ments, be printed. Ordered. His lordship then stated, that if the prints should be on the table before Monday, he should move the consideration of the amendments on that day.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.] Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>said, that in consequence of what had passed in the late discussion of this measure, and of the consideration which he had since been enabled to give to the subject, he thought it would be more advisable to empower the committee to separate all that part of the bill which related to trial by jury, from the other parts which related to the division of the court of session into three chambers, and the formation of a court of review. He thought this mode would be better than that of which notice had been given on the former night of discussion by a noble and learned lord, namely, to strike out in the committee all the clauses which related to trial by jury, as, if this latter mode was adopted, it might lead to a supposition that it was intended to abandon altogether the proposed introduction of trial by jury. On the contrary, he hoped that that part of the plan would ultimately be adopted by their lordships. As, however, there was considerable difference with respect to the means of carrying this desirable object into effect, and as, with respect to the division of the court of session into three chambers, there was scarcely any difference of opinion, and but little on the subject of the formation of the court of review, these parts of the plan might be adopted with much less delay, if considered in a separate bill, than if they remained incorporated with the clauses relating to trial by jury. He should therefore move to postpone the committee to Monday, intending, on that day, to move the instruction which he had before stated, and in the consideration of that part of the subject respecting the division of the court of session and the court of review, it was his intention to propose several amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Eldon</member> <membercontribution>thanked the noble lord for having thus given farther time for the consideration of that part of the subject which was involved in considerable difficulty, namely, the trial by jury. He had no doubt that the trial by jury might, in some cases, be beneficially introduced into Scotland; but great consideration would be required with respect to the means of carrying it into effect, in order that it might not produce injury instead of good. With respect to the other part of the subject, he would give it every consideration in his power, and en
<col>148</col>
deavour to come to that result, which, whilst in his judgment it would tend to remedy the evil that existed, would not violate the act of union. He doubted whether the court of review should not be rather sought in the chambers of the court of session, similar to our court of exchequer-chamber, with relation to the courts in Westminster-hall, than rendered a distinct court superior to the court of session, which he was inclined to think not consistent with the articles of union.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>declined entering at present into a detailed consideration of the subject, but he had no doubt that in the proper stage of the bill he should be able to convince their lordships that the difficulties in the way of the introduction of trial by jury in civil cases into Scotland were much less than were apprehended; that, on the contrary, it would be comparatively an easy task, whilst at the same time it would be a most beneficial measure to that country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville </member> <membercontribution>merely wished to throw out for consideration the necessity which in his opinion existed of adopting means to bring causes to greater maturity in the outer house, without which he thought the proposed measure would not produce any thing like the beneficial effect expected from it. With this view he thought it would be more advisable to have only two chambers in the inner house, whose sole business it should be to review the decisions given in the outer house, where, from the larger portion of time allowed to the judges for transacting business, that business might be done well. If, however, it was determined to have three chambers, he thought that one of those chambers should be allotted solely to the business of the outer house, in which case, from the single responsibility attached to the judges, every thing that could result from efficiency and from solemnity of decision might be expected. His only object was, that the measure should undergo the most serious and attentive discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale rose</member> <membercontribution>chiefly for the purpose of doing away any impression that might result from what had been said by the noble viscount, that his noble friend, who had proposed the measure, had not given to it the most anxious consideration. He agreed with the noble viscount in the necessity of adopting some means of doing the business in the outer house in a better manner, as it had been calculated that a lord of session, in consequence of the multiplicity of other business, had only 63 hours in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0090"/>
<col>149</col>
the year to allot to that in the outer house. This, however, had been provided for in the present plan, by which (the three chambers only sitting alternately) 8 judges might always be allotted to the business of the outer house, whilst, according to the proposition of the noble viscount, only five could sit there.&#x2014;After some further conversation, the committee was postponed to Monday, for which day the lords were ordered to be summoned.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[ROMAN CATHOLICS ARMY AND NAVY SERVICE BILL.]&#x2014;Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>rose and addressed the house as follows:&#x2014;Sir, since I had the honour of introducing into this house, a bill for allowing dissenters of every description, to enter into his majesty's military and naval services, under certain restrictions, circumstances have occurred which have twice induced me to move for the postponement of the second reading of that bill. I now rise to state, that the same circumstances still continue to operate, and that I shall not be prepared to-morrow to propose the second reading. Not being able to ascertain on what day it may be in my power to proceed with this bill, I think it consistent with my public duty to make this statement, in consequence of which the order of the day for the second reading will be dropped, to be revived as the house may think fit. I am aware, sir, that this intimation must attract much observation, and that the house and the public will naturally expect some information with respect to the motives of it.
<col>150</col>
All I can now say is, that I must beg their indulgence (hear! hear! from all parts of the house). I am not at present authorised, nor would it accord with my duty, to enter into any explanation on the subject. Whenever the proper time shall come, I can assure the house, that no man will be more ready than I shall be to state fully that, which under the present circumstances, I feel bound to withhold. I therefore must confine myself to giving notice, that I shall not move to-morrow for the second reading of the Roman Catholics Army and Navy Service bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MR. PAULL'S PETITION RESPECTING THE WESTMINSTER ELECTION.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion of lord H. Petty, the house went into the further consideration of Mr. Paull's Petition respecting the Westminster Election.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan rose</member> <membercontribution>and said, that he was aware that standing in the situation he did, he was entitled to comment upon, and to sum up all the evidence that had been adduced in support of the allegations contained in the petition now before the house. He should, however, wave that right; the evidence was in the hands of every member of that house, and he was not anxious, if he could do so, to add to the impression testimony of such a nature must have already produced; he would content himself with one remark, which was, that that evidence, weak and futile as it was, did not say more to its own confusion than would have been proved by witnesses unimpeachable, which he (Mr. Sheridan), had the house thought it necessary, was ready to bring forward. As an instance, he should mention merely Mr. Weatherhead himself. When an inquiry was made as to his services in the navy, he confessed himself not quite satisfied with the return of the navy office. A noble lord (Folkestone) was equally dissatisfied, but upon different grounds. The noble lord seemed to think that this Mr. Weatherhead had been calumniated, and accordingly the noble lord moved for a return at once more exact and comprehensive. What had been the issue of this attempt to rescue the character of Mr Weatherhead from this supposed slander? Why, in truth, no more than this: that he, Mr. Weatherhead, had not served in one ship only, but in twelve or thirteen, that he had continued in one ship a year, in another three months, in a third a month, in a fourth three weeks, and in a fifth five days; running, as it were, the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0091"/>
<col>151</col>
gauntlet of the British navy; for it appeared that he had been actually guilty of desertion from each ship, though in the first return it appeared that he had deserted but once. But it was not more difficult to fix the station of this naval officer to a certain ship, than to fix his birth to a certain place; he had the singular good fortune to be born at a number of different places; he was born first at Newcastle, next at Morpeth, and after some other births he was finally brought forth in London (a laugh). But there was another slight ground of objection to the character of this witness; in the month of Sept. 1803, he Petitioned to be examined for a lieutenancy, and to the recommendatory certificates of the different captains under whom he served, there was but one objection, namely, that they were all discovered to be forgeries. He was not anxious to press upon the house the gross and flagrant contradictions and absurdities in the evidence they had heard; he did not wish to expose the miserable wretches to the just rigour of the honest indignation they had so universally excited; but he would put it to the feelings of that house, whether it was not necessary to inquire how far those wretches had been the tools of a conspiracy; how far it was the duty of any agent or agents to inquire into the nature of the testimony and the character of the witnesses, more especially in a case where this evidence went directly to affect the seat of a member of parliament, to mention nothing of the danger of propagating groundless slander against a privy counsellor. It was for the house to consider how far the agents are responsible for employing wretches as substantial evidence, whose character they might have learned (had they been ignorant of it) in the neighbourhood of Bow street, Hatton-garden, and Newgate; but he should abstain; he would keep his word with the house, and not enter into any remarks upon the evidence. He had an idea of submitting some motion for the purpose of investigating the charge of conspiracy; he should, however, in compliance with the suggestions of those hon. friends, whose superior judgement was with him decisive, give way, and should now, through a motive of delicacy, retire, leaving his cause with confidence to the house, assured as he was, that the house would with becoming dignity assert its own character and honour, and in doing so preserve his.&#x2014;Mr. Sheridan immediately withdrew.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. M. A. Taylor rose</member> <membercontribution>and said:&#x2014;Sir; when this question first came before the
<col>152</col>
house, it certainly did not assume the serious aspect which it has taken this moment. I have read with considerable attention, the minutes of the evidence, which have been taken at your bar in short hand; and I must say, that I differ from the right hon. gent. who has just spoken, as to the course of procedure which ought to be adopted. I may venture to say, that a more flagrant conspiracy never before presented itself to this house. It is not only injurious to the character of the house, but it is, in my opinion, a new mode of attacking Mr. Grenville's bill. It is, I aver, an attempt to make this house a channel of injustice, and the vehicle of malice. On looking over the whole business, although the house may not be of opinion that it is a case requiring us to request his majesty to instruct the attorney general to prosecute criminally; yet, I submit that it is one in which it may be necessary to punish some of the witnesses for gross prevarication. It is well known that the house is always zealous in hearing every thing respecting the rights of individuals that can be offered; and such has been the case in the present instance; but I am still of opinion, that the person who signed that petition, had no reason to be alarmed that any witnesses had been bribed, otherwise he or his solicitor must have inquired into their characters. The apparent motive has been, that such a proceeding might find its way to the hearts of men, so as to prejudge the previous petition, which is in dependence. I must do Mr. Paull the justice to say, that I believe he never would have signed the petition, had he really inquired into or been informed of the real characters of those who were to support it. But those who have acted for him, seem to have used unfair means, merely for the purpose of exciting suspicion. The letter in the custody of Harris appears, from the evidence, to be a forged one. There has evidently been a conspiracy in the present instance. Reasoning upon the principles of justice and morality, is not a conspiracy an attempt to fasten upon a man a wrong which he never did, a crime which he never committed? Take that definition along with you, and look at the character of Drake, one of the witnesses. He appeared before you, he said, as a wounded officer who had fought the battles of his country. He alledged that he had been several times wounded in the service; by the return which has been made, however, he never received his pension for any wound he received in the back; but,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0092"/>
<col>153</col>
that he fell from the mast head of a vessel, and broke his leg, which was afterwards amputated. Nor has this Mr. Drake been able to state, with truth, where he was born. After stating various places in England, he afterwards says, that, when in company with Homan, he boasted he could drink six bottles of claret, because he was an Irishman. Here the hon. member stated various inconsistencies in the evidence of this witness, in which he said, there did not appear a word of truth. Both Drake and Weatherhead were persons who ought, said the hon gent., in my opinion, to receive your utmost censure; and you ought even to adopt the most rigorous measures. For my part, I should humbly submit, that a prosecution ought to be commenced by the crown, against both of them, for a conspiracy; but although you should not think it proper to punish for a conspiracy, yet surely you will punish any man who comes with lies and falsehoods in his mouth to the bar! I may still go further, and say that from the evidence of the other witnesses, it appears, that a conspiracy has been running through the whole of them. If the house do not think that there is enough to entitle them to commit for prevarication, I should be inclined to think, that Mr. Sheridan himself would be fully justified in bringing the question under the cognizance of a civil court. The house, perhaps, would rather wish that Mr. Paull should have the advantage of the witnesses being previously examined upon their oath, before a select committee, as it is not in the power of the commons to make inquiries before them upon oath. All that the house can judge of is the inconsistency. In my opinion, the petition of Mr. Paull ought to be declared false, scandalous, and malicious. This I say appears from the evidence; and I may state that I form this opinion from that alone, not having been in any way connected with the election, nor did I ever see Mr. Paull, till I saw him at the bar of the house; but I feel it my duty, as a member of the house, to support its character, its privileges, its justice, and its probity. Upon these grounds, I cannot submit to pass unnoticed, a petition that would make this house a channel of injustice, for I feel a deep interest in supporting Mr. Grenville's act, as it is one that characterizes the virtue of the house of commons. I never will sit by, tamely, and see, by a new mode and under false pretexts, the security and ends of its justice defeated or sapped in the very foundation. With the leave of the
<col>154</col>
house, therefore, I shall submit a motion, which, when agreed to, I shall follow up with another respecting Mr. Drake, whose prevarications have been most eminently conspicuous. The hon. gent. then concluded with moving, "That the allegations contained in the said petition are false and scandalous."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>said, he had all along acted in this business from a sense of justice and propriety, and a firm belief that the witnesses to be adduced in support of the allegations in the petition, would have clearly and consistently proved them; and though he would not say that the whole of the witnesses had been consistent, or had given their testimony without some difference, yet he thought enough had been proved, by consistent testimony, to sustain the allegations in the petition, in such a manner as to vindicate Mr. Paull, and the agents who acted confidentially for him, against the charge of conspiracy alledged by the hon. member who last spoke Of the character or testimony of Weatherhead, he did not wish to say much; but he thought hat a weak cause, the defence of which rested upon no other ground than that of impeaching the characters of those who came forward to give testimony against it. If, however, it could be shewn, from the evidence itself, that there was in it no such inconsistency as that now alledged, he hoped that it would be admitted, that the arguments of the hon. gent. must, in a great measure, fall to the ground. Laying no stress at all on the testimony of Weatherhead, he yet was of opinion, that the evidence of Drake was consistent with itself, in all its parts. He was examined and cross-examined at the bar of that house, by men of the first talents in the country: and, except in a point or two of no importance, he could find no inconsistency in his evidence. The hon. gent. who last spoke, had assumed in the first instance, that the letter which had been mentioned as written by Mr. Sheridan, and in the hands of Emanuel Harris, was a forgery. This however, did not appear from any evidence before the house. If it really was a forgery, certainly Drake must be guilty of the most criminal conduct: but was it possible, if that were the case, that he should be so anxious for the production of a letter which must have furnished evidence against himself? The hon. gent. too, had endeavoured to implicate Mr. Powell, and the other agents of Mr. Paull, in a charge of conspiracy, by joining with Drake, in the endeavour
<image src="S1V0009P0I0093"/>
<col>155</col>
to obtain from Emanuel Harris the letter in question; whereas it was the obvious interest of Mr. Paull and his agents, that the letter should remain in the hands of Harris, to be produced in evidence when necessary. It had been asserted, that Drake was not authorized by Mr. Sheridan to offer 30<i>l.</i> to Harris, for the letter; but Drake's evidence stated, that he was authorized to procure the letter, either for money, or by any other means in his power; and he saw no reason to doubt, that, in consequence of the conversations Drake had with Mr. Sheridan, and the anxiety expressed by that gentleman to obtain the letter in question, Drake was extremely desirous to obtain it from Harris, with a view, perhaps, to turn it to his own emolument, by surrendering it to Mr. Sheridan for a sum of money. Adding to this, the frequent interviews Drake had with Mr. Sheridan, both at the house of Mr. Homan and elsewhere&#x2014;the alledged wish of Mr. Sheridan to have Drake taken up&#x2014;yet instead of so doing, advising him to get out of the way; and the various instances of frequent and confidential intercourse with Mr. Sheridan, all which Drake had alledged, and which were not disproved, were circumstances that in his mind cast a very strange mystery over the business: but, for his own part, he conceived the evidence of Drake so consistent upon the main points of the case, that he felt no disposition to doubt his testimony upon others. The hon. gent. had stated also, in order to inculpate Mr. Paull and his agents, that before they accepted the evidence of Drake, they ought to have enquired his character at the navy office and elsewhere; but such an enquiry could not be necessary to justify them in considering Drake to have been some time in the confidence of Mr. Sheridan, when it was notorious that he was married to a natural daughter of that gentleman by her father's consent; that he was constantly admitted upon a familiar footing of intercourse at Mr. Sheridan's house; allowed to wait for him in the same room with other company; and that, at one time, Mr. Sheridan had left a party in which he was engaged, in order to converse with Drake; that the latter had frequently negociated bills drawn or accepted by Mr. Sheridan; and, in fact, was known to be on such a footing with him, as to obviate all doubt that he had been in Mr. Sheridan's confidence, and that the evidence he could give would be useful to them. Upon the whole, the noble lord was of opinion, that sufficient evidence had been
<col>156</col>
adduced to sustain the allegations of the petition, to which petition it was to be remembered Mr. Paull had not resorted precipitately, or without the advice of his counsel.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. M. A. Taylor</member> <membercontribution>assured the noble lord he had no idea whatever of charging either Mr. Paull or Mr. Powell, with being engaged in the conspiracy, but confined the charge solely to the witnesses produced at the bar of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, he had heard with surprize the declaration made by the noble lord at the outset, and with still greater surprize, the expressions with which he had closed. He would not travel out of the evidence before the house, but from that alone he would prove the falsehood of the witnesses adduced in support of the petition, and establish their infamy out of their own mouths. The allegations of the petition were, that the sitting member had by himself and by other persons offered money to suppress or corrupt the evidence to be offered before the committee, which was to try his right to his seat. Was there any proof that Mr. Sheridan had taken any pains to get Mr. Drake out of the way, who was the principal witness to prove these charges? The noble lord said, Mr. Sheridan had strove to get the letter from Harris. Was there any proof of that? And if there was any proof that any person whomsoever in Mr. Sheridan's interest did in any one instance utter a word like tampering (as he believed there was not), what proof was there that such person was Mr. Sheridan's agent any more than Mr. Paull's. If it was proved that some of the allegations of the petition were absolutely false, and there was no proof that the others were true, was it not to be naturally concluded that the whole were false? In answer to the first question asked him at the bar of the house, who he was, Drake answered he was an acting lieutenant of the navy. That was proved by the Returns of the Navy Office to be false. He said, he lost his leg in the battle of Camperdown; it was proved he lost it long after that battle, in consequence of a fall from the mast, which rendered amputation necessary. He said he had ten or twelve different pensions from the king, in consequence of wounds he had received. It was proved he had only one pension from the Chest at Greenwich. Let the noble lord, if he could, make out a consistent evidence for this man, after these falsehoods. The noble lord wished to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0094"/>
<col>157</col>
give up Weatherhead. But as the petitioner had called him, and the petitioner's counsel had dwelt on his deposition in his summing up, he must make use of him. Drake said, he was directed by Mr. Sheridan, to get the letter from Harris. He said that the first letter preceded the second only two or three days. Harris said, it had been in his possession a full month before the 2d. and long before the dissolution of parliament. Then the noble lord contended, that if the first letter had been a forgery, Drake would naturally have endeavoured to conceal every thing respecting it. But the noble lord forgot that Drake told the house he had burned it, and consequently that he could not incur any penalty from it. He would not allow the noble lord to exclude Weatherhead's evidence, however convenient it might be for his case. Drake said, he had written all the letter, with the letters M. P. to which Mr. Sheridan prefixed his name. Weatherhead said, Mr. Sheridan wrote M. P. as well as his name. Drake said Mr. Sheridan signed the letter in the Shakespeare Coffee-house, just as he was going out to the election, and that there was an immense crowd before the door. Harris proved he had the letter a month before the election, when the Shakespeare Coffee-house was not open. If the noble lord had examined these matters, and judged of them as he did, he would not have attempted to uphold a testimony so invalidated. With regard to the second letter, Drake said first, that he was present when it was signed; and afterwards, that it was written not in his presence but in an adjoining room. Weatherhead said he wrote it, but that Harris objected to the M. P. there being then no parliament, and wished the addition of Treasurer of the Navy, and Mr. Sheridan's residence. He says he wrote those additions all in one line, and that Mr. Sheridan prefixed his name on that line. But he had seen the letter here alluded to, and he pledged himself that Richard Brinsley Sheridan was one line, Somerset-house a second, and the third was Treasurer, Navy. The copy before the house was exactly similar, except that the third line was treasurer of the navy, instead of treasurer, navy, as in the original. What inference could be drawn from such evidence as this, except that the allegations that were founded upon it were false? Drake said at first, he went by authority of Mr. Sheridan to buy up the letter from Harris, and he avowed that, at that very time, he intended to make use of the letter
<col>158</col>
against Mr. S.: but this he afterwards retracted, and said, he formed the determination of using the letter against Mr. S., on some subsequent provocation. But Harris before that time had returned from Portsmouth, and had given Mr. S. a copy of the letter, and was advised by Mr. S. to deliver up the original to the messenger of that house, or to Mr. Paull's agents. But Harris was unwilling to part with the letter till he should produce it before the committee of the house, according to his summons. If, after this, there could be a doubt, that the allegations in the petition, so contrary to these facts, were false, it was impossible that any inference could be deduced from internal evidence. The charges with respect to the tampering by agents, were equally unfounded. Only one person was liable in the slightest degree that the most forced constructions could exaggerate into any thing like tampering; and that person, who had not thought it necessary to defend himself either personally or by counsel against such an accuser, could not be said to be an agent of Mr. Sheridan. He did not wish to implicate Mr. Powell: but Richardson who, by the bye, had answered yes and no at different times to the same question, confessed, that he went to Mr. Burgess to tempt him to offer him money, with the intention to betray that offer. But Mr. Burgess, like a wise and honourable man, would not listen to any such proposition. This same Mr. Richardson confessed, that he wrote a letter to Mr. T. Sheridan, in which he threatened to go over to the other party, unless he got money. And he likewise went to Mr. Burgess, and offered to betray to him copies of the whole of the proceedings of Mr. Paull's committee: but this offer also Mr. Burgess, like an honourable man, refused. He should be sorry to accuse Mr. Paull or Mr. Powell of being concerned in a conspiracy; but he thought that if they could not have taken care to prevent such acts, they should have at least more maturely weighed the evidence of such persons, before they founded such charges upon it. He acquitted the counsel of any improper intention in what they had offered to the house; but they should consistently with their usual diligence, have sifted more minutely the false and scandalous evidence by which the false and scandalous allegations in the petition were supported. He agreed in the propriety of the motions proposed by his hon. friend.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to, lord Folkestone alone having faintly said "no."</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>observed, that though the other witnesses for the petitioner had grossly misconducted themselves, he did not think it necessary to have recourse to any further severity, and therefore would propose no motion with respect to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[FREEHOLD ESTATES BILL.] The Solicitor General</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for the third reading of the bill for rendering the Freehold Estates of persons who die insolvent, assets for the payment of their simple contract debts.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tuffnell</member> <membercontribution>said, that he did not doubt the present bill would operate in a considerable degree to enlarge the credit of freehold proprietors, and facilitate the raising of large sums of money, which, to many, would be a considerable source of prosperity; but, at the same time, it must obviously be productive of considerable inconvenience, and in many cases of much mischief to the creditor, who having no means to come at any precise knowledge of the debts already due by the freehold proprietor, or the settlements made upon his estate, would feel himself much disappointed, upon the demise of his debtor, to find debts to a much larger amount than he expected charged upon that property to which he looked for his security. This would necessarily give rise to litigations without end, and set the new creditor upon endeavouring to find out flaws in the settlements which preceded his claims, with a view to set them aside for his own advantage; and thus, in many instances, the creditors, for whose security this bill was avowedly designed, would have just reason to complain that their property was injured rather than served, through a measure which would teach them to advance large sums, and to rely often upon a hollow security. He thought too, that it was unfair to place the freehold property of the country on such a footing, while the copyhold was exempt; and peculiarly severe to involve the whole of the former, merely for the faults of a few men. He was convinced the learned gent. who introduced this bill, was amply competent to devise means for his purpose much more eligible. He concluded by expressing a hope that the bill would be re
<col>160</col>
committed, and that further time would be given for the better consideration of a subject of such importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>observed, that in the present stage of the bill, it was too late after it had been engrossed, to have it recommitted.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>defended the bill. He stated that the present bill was not a new idea of the hon. and learned gentleman's who brought it in, but that a bill similar to the present, and still more extensive, as including copyhold property, was brought in, in the year 1772, by a most learned lawyer, Mr. Ambler, and had passed through that house at a time when there were a great many very eminent lawyers who had seats there. It was lost afterwards in the lords, in a very thin house, when 7 voted against it and but 5 for it. He could easily state many cases of the most severe injustice which could be practised under the present law. Country bankers might purchase landed estates with the money of other people, and these estates would descend to their heirs free from all their debts as bankers. As a master in chancery, many cases came before him, where creditors for considerable sums stated that they did not think it worth their while to prove their debts, as they had no specialties, and the property of the deceased was principally in landed estates. He considered this property of freehold estates not being liable to those debts, as a mere remnant of antiquity, that had been kept up long after the reason of it had ceased.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Master of the Rolls </member>, <membercontribution>upon such a proposition as that which was then before the house, a proposition which, if it was carried into effect, would make a most material change in the law of the land, felt it to be his duty to state his sentiments most fully and explicitly on the subject. In so doing, it was necessary, first, that he should, endeavour to bring to the recollection of the house, that it was only under the feudal laws that freehold property was first established; and it was impossible for any man to tell what further change the present innovation might lead to. By the old law of France, the moment a man was married, one half of his property was secured for the benefit of his children; by the present law of Scotland in certain cases, the whole property was secured by law to their heirs: but did any man ever say that these laws were unjust? They might be deemed impolitic in many instances, but they certainly were not unjust. It had been said that it would be unjust that the heir to an estate
<image src="S1V0009P0I0096"/>
<col>161</col>
should be living in affluence, whilst the creditors of his predecessor were left to starve; but would it not be also an injustice if the heir to an estate were to be deprived of his birth-right through the improvidence of his predecessor, and be left in the greatest possible distress, perhaps, in some cases, whilst he was paying the debts of another person's contracting? If this new principle was to get footing once amongst the laws of England, almost every marriage contract in the kingdom might possibly be annulled. Allowance should be made for the necessary fictions and peculiarities which were adopted in law proceedings; it might be reckoned absurd, for instance, that in the case of specialty or simple contract debts, the addition of a bit of wax in the one case, whilst in the other there was nothing but the name subscribed, should give the one such superiority over the other, that the one would be for the most part paid, whilst the other would, in many instances, be left unpaid. But such were the established distinctions which were sanctioned by the laws of the realm, and no evil was found to result there-from. With respect to the cases which were stated to have occurred before the masters in chancery, a bill might be brought in to remedy those particular cases without making any general alteration in the principle of our laws. This he conceived to be a most important consideration, and it brought into his mind the observation, that no country in the world was so jealous of its political liberty as this was&#x2014;and yet he maintained that our political was nothing in comparison with our civil liberty. In this point of view he considered the bill as one that might be productive of the most serious consequences to the country. It might have been necessary at the time of Edward I but it was not suited to the state of England under George III. when commercial speculations had increased to an extent that our ancestors could not have thought possible ever to have been brought about. If this measure was to be now adopted, a man who was disposed to commit a fraud would only be led to vest his money in copyhold instead of freehold property; the commercial man, if he possessed the most extensive funded property, would have only to get into that house and he might defy his creditors. At the time of the introduction of the statute of Frauds, the statute of Limitations, and at the time of the enactment of a law to regulate cases of Debtor and Creditor in our colonies, it must have come to the
<col>162</col>
recollection of the legislature that there was this peculiarity in the law which it was now proposed to alter; but still it was never, at these times, thought of changing the law with respect to England; a plantation was only considered as an instrument of commerce, whilst the attachment to the soil of England was cherished by the legislature. There had, since that, been two attempts to graft a measure, of the nature now before the house, upon the English code, the one by the late lord Kenyon, and the other by another most eminent lawyer, but both these luminaries of the law, upon mature deliberation, abandoned the measure, as being unsuited to the genius and manners of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. C. Wynne</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the frequent passing of acts of insolvency was a proof of the defect of our laws with relation to debtor and creditor. As the law now stood, a man who advanced a sum of money to another would take care to have the best security possible for the recovery of the amount of that debt, whilst the honest and industrious tradesman would for the most part suffer for the want of a similar security.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Calvert</member> <membercontribution>declared, that he had conversed with several persons upon this subject, but he never heard of such frauds as had been alluded to this night. The men of landed property he now heard represented as being the rich and the oppressors, and the commercial part of the community were spoken of as a poor and distressed set of people. The very reverse of this he believed to be the fact. The landed property men were the sheep, whom the minister, whoever he was, could easily lay hold of and sheer at pleasure; when, if a minister attempted to lay his hands on any particular branch of commerce, there were meetings in every coffee-house in London, and in many cases they escaped from his grasp.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Advocate</member> <membercontribution>of Scotland observed, that it was a peculiarity in the English law, which was unknown to the ancient Greeks or Romans, or to any modern state in Europe, that the death of a man should put an end to all the moral obligations which he owed the world. He was himself, in the proper sense of the word, a strong aristocrat; but he did not think it right to support the aristocracy by such means as the law now sanctioned. In Scotland and in Germany a most high and honourable sentiment of the antiquity and greatness of families prevailed; but still they did not allow a man to roll in the wealth which had been
<image src="S1V0009P0I0097"/>
<col>163</col>
left him by his ancestors, whilst at the same time he would stare the creditor of that man in the face, and say he would not pay him. He asked any man in that house, would it not give him an additional pang upon his death-bed, if he knew that he was to die without being able to do justice to his fair creditors? He asked any man, could he bear to think of going in grandeur to the funeral of a relation who had left him a considerable estate, without at the same time some qualms of conscience disturbing his breast, if he knew that the debts of that relation were left unsatisfied and that he did not mean to discharge them? A man must have a mind incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, or else he must design wilfully to deceive, if he did not answer these questions in the affirmative. It was but two days since the house passed a law on the grounds of humanity and justice, against every argument of expediency which could be urged, and could they, then, refuse their sanction to a measure so founded on justice as the present? The idea of innovation was held out as a bugbear; but was every science, art, and manufacture to improve by innovation, whilst the law alone should be deprived of its claim to pursue a similar course of amendment?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Canning</member> <membercontribution>compared the present to a law which had formerly been introduced for the regulation of country banker, by making their estates liable to their debts. Lord Kenyon observed upon that measure, that it would be necessary that every banker should have a map of his estate and catalogue of the incumbrances on it hung up in his house. A measure of that sort had been adopted in Ireland, and the only result was, that it increased commercial property, and rendered the estates unsaleable. Such, he contended, would be the result of the present measure, if it was to be adopted by the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor General rose</member> <membercontribution>to reply. He had listened with the most patient attention to the objections that had been urged against the measure, both in and out of that house, not with a view technically to advocate it more effectually, but with the determination wholly to abandon it, should those objections appear to him to possess any weight. The result, however, was, that the sentiments with which he sat out on the subject, remained unaltered. He was decidedly of opinion, that to exempt an estate from the payment of debts contracted by its late possessor, was a most flagrant act of injustice. He was
<col>164</col>
surprised that there were those who maintained that such an exemption was just, and he was somewhat concerned that among them was the only member of that house who was invested with the robes of magistracy. He had not proposed this alteration in the law hastily. Before his introduction of it into the house he had consulted the highest legal authorities in the kingdom upon it, and, with the exception of his honourable and learned friend (and even he had not expressed any direct dissent), it had received their unanimous and perfect approbation. A rt. hon. gent. had accused him of attacking the aristocracy of the country. He had a high respect for the aristocracy, as forming a part of our mixed constitution; he had indeed shewn a higher respect for it than that which had been displayed by the opposers of the bill; for he wished to rescue the aristocracy from the imputation of being unwilling to pay their debts: he wished to shew, that they did not owe their weight in the country to an unjust law, by which their just creditors might be defra<ob/>ded. (Hear! hear!) The hon. and learned gent. asserted that this bill had the approbation of the three presiding judges of three of the highest tribunals of the country; and, that it was a bill for the relief of the poor creditor against his rich debtor. He described and argued upon the situation in which poor servants and inferior tradesmen were placed, with regard to their rich debtors, as the law now stood; for not having in general any bonds, theirs being merely simple contract debts, they could not recover against the heir of their debtor. After dwelling for some time on the injustice resulting from this deficiency in the law, repeating the words of sir John Strange, that "a man who dies, without making provision for the payment of his debts, sins in his grave," the learned gent. concluded with expressing his hope, that the house would not suffer a bill to be lost, which had for its object the removal of that deficiency, and which proposed to remedy an evil, that was in fact a reproach to the justice of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Master of the Rolls</member> <member>explained, and assured his hon. and learned friend, that he never intended to throw an imputation on the bill before the house, or on the fair intention of its learned mover.</member></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor General</member> <membercontribution>was sorry to have misunderstood his rt. hon. friend, and assured him that nothing was farther from his mind than to give a moment's pain to his right hon. friend.&#x2014;The question was now loudly

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;The following members were chosen to try the merits of the Lanark election petition: lord G. H. Cavendish, J. F. Cawthorne, esq., lord R. E. H. Somerset, C. Chester, esq., hon. W. Gore, T. Wood, esq., E. Harvey, esq., T. Thornton, Esq., W. Bagwell, esq., lord Brooke, right hon. R. P. Carew. Nominees: C. Dundas, esq., J. Paterson, esq.&#x2014;The Secretary at War rose, pursuant to notice, tomove for leave to bring in a bill for paying the allowances to half-pay officers, their widows, and persons on the Compassionate List, at their own residences. In the object of this bill all would agree. It was one which was very desirable, if it could be effected, and he could anticipate no objection to it. He therefore need not trouble the house at length on the subject. He concluded by moving for leave to bring in two bills, the one to pay the allowance as above, and the other to enable the Kilmainham hospital commissioners to make regulations for the more easy add speedy payment of pensions. Agreed to.&#x2014;Lord H. Petty obtained leave to bring in a bill to rectify an error in the act of last session, for settling additional allowances on the younger branches of the royal family.&#x2014; Mr. Vansittart obtained leave to bring in a bill for extending to the outports the provisions of the custom-house office reform bill, and for applying to the superannuated fund such retrenchments as may be made in consequence of that extension.&#x2014;The Advocate General presented to the house, according to order, a bill to authorize the payment of Prize Money, arising from captures made by ships of his Sicilian majesty in conjunction with British ships, to the Sicilian envoy, for the use of the officers and men of such ships; and the same was received, and read the first time.&#x2014;The Serjeant at Arms at the bar informed the house, that pursuant to order he had taken the rt. hon. R. B. Sheridan into custody as a defaulter at one of the late calls of the house. It was ordered that Mr. Sheridan should be discharged at the rising of the house this day, paying his fees. Shortly after Mr. Sheridan left the bar, where he was held in custody, and advanced to the treasury bench; upon which the Speaker called order! order! and observed that nothing could be more irregular thou the en-
<col>166</col>
trance of the rt. hon. gent. into the house; Mr. Sheridan being, strictly speaking, still in the custody of the serjeant at arms. Mr. Sheridan appeared altogether unaware of the irregularity he was committing, and hardly sensible that the Speaker was addressing himself to him, till Mr. Hobhouse took him by the arm, and explained the matter to him as he was conducting him back to the bar. The Speaker informed the serjeant, that it was the pleasure of the house that Mr. Sheridan should be discharged at its rising this day. Of course it was his duty to keep him in custody till then. Mr. Hobhouse apologized for his rt. hon. friend, who was not aware of the irregularity of coming into the house while in custody.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SCOTCH TAXES REGULATION BILL.]&#x2014;Lord H. Petty rose</member>, <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, to move for leave to bring in a bill to provide for the payment of the public revenues in Scotland into the banks of that country, for the purpose of being remitted to the bank of England. The principle of the measure had already obtained the sanction of the last parliament by the acts requiring the payment of the public money from the several departments of the excise, customs, post-office, &amp;c. into the bank of England. The same principle would apply in the measure he now proposed, with some circumstances of local distinction, rendered necessary by there being two national banks in Scotland. The collectors of the revenue in that country would be required, by the bill he was about to propose, to make up their accounts on the last day of every month, and to transmit them, with the sums they should have on hand, to the receiver general of the land tax for Scotland, who was to deposit the money, half in the bank of Scotland, and the other half in the royal bank, from which banks it was to be remitted to the bank of England, whenever it should amount to 5000l., there to be kept with the other public monies received from the different departments of the revenue, according to the provisions of the acts of the last parliament. As the Scotch revenue was liable to certain occasional, and sometimes sudden, demands for particular services, provision was to be made for advances for those services, and when the receiver general should certify the occasion to the banks, that certificate would be a warrant to them to issue the money and to make a deduction to that amount from any sum on hand to the remitted to the bank of England. The banks of Scotland were to keep accounts of all monies thus
<image src="S1V0009P0I0099"/>
<col>167</col>
received, and these accounts were to be liable to the inspection of the lord advocate for the time being. This bill, when it should have received the sanction of the legislature, as he hoped it would, would be the completion of the system he had the honour to introduce, and he had the satisfaction to think, that when it should have passed, the whole of the public money would be placed in a perfect state of security. He moved for leave to bring in a bill to regulate the payment of the revenues of Scotland into the banks of Scotland, in order to their being remitted to the bank of England.&#x2014;After a few words from Mr. Rose, who coincided entirely in the propriety of the bill, leave was given to bring it in.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[SLAVE TRADE, ABOLITION BILL.] The Earl of Westmoreland</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition from certain planters, mortgagees, merchants and others, interested in the West India islands, against a clause added by the house of commons to the Slave Trade Abolition bill, enacting that negroes seized in consequence of illicit trade, should be declared free, which they stated would be productive of great danger to the colonies. Ordered to lie on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for taking into consideration the amendments made by the house of commons in the Slave Trade Abolition bill. His lordship observed that the object of the greater part of these ammendments was to inforce penalties and forfeitures upon those carrying on the trade, after the period fixed by parliament for its abolition, which it was not the practice of that house to enact. These amendments; therefore, were merely calculated the better to carry into effect the principle of the bill. With respect to the amendment in the preamble, leaving out the words, declaring the trade to be contrary to justice, humanity, and sound policy, it would not be imagined after what he had said upon the subject, that his opinion had sustained any alteration. It having, however, been thought right by the house of commons to make this alteration, in order that the feelings of those concerned in the trade might not be wounded, he had no objection to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Bishop of Landaff rose</member> <membercontribution>to deliver his opinion of the bill, which he had not till then an opportunity of doing. The right reverend prelate observed, that in judging of the propriety of the preamble as it originally stood, or of the amendments that had been made in it, the different states of slavery as they existed at different periods of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0100"/>
<col>169</col>
the world should duly be considered. Certain conditions of slavery existed in the antediluvian World full 700 years before Noah; and such must have existed both before and after the formation of civil society. Under the circumstances of those times, multitudes must have existed, who could derive sustenance only from their labour, and who, in order to secure the means of support, were willing to surrender up that labour, and with it their freedom. Such a state of slavery might not indeed be considered as contrary to justice and humanity, because it was a voluntary act on the part of those who submitted to it; but, although that state of slavery might not be judged inconsistent with justice and humanity, it did not follow that other descriptions of it might not be highly inhuman and unjust; for what could be more contrary to justice and humanity, than to excite civil war in a country, and then take advantage of the calamities arising from it to force away the miserable inhabitants into an hopeless captivity? Such he conceived to be the nature of the trade which it was proposed to abolish. Its abolition was an act Of national humanity and justice; it was an act that would never be blotted out in the records of divine mercy. He was ready to confess, that the most keenly exploring eye might not be able to dive into the consequences of such a measure; but as it evidently sprang from the root of undissembled piety and humanity, it should not be supposed to be productive of evil; but, on the contrary, that it must be healing and beneficial to mankind.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member> <membercontribution>could not let slip this last opportunity of entering his protest against the bill; he must therefore repeat some of his former objections to it, though he was aware that the repetition must in some degree be irksome to the house. At least he must remind them that one More occasion presented itself to allow them to rectify their opinions, which they should be the more induced to do from the awful warning contained in the petition which he had that day laid on their lordship's table. From that petition they might collect the dreadful consequences which even the resolutions of last year were producing in Jamaica. Every thing there seemed to indicate the approach of an organised insurrection, which might receive a new stimulus and encouragement from the bill now on the eve of passing. It, therefore, called again for the most serious consideration of their lordships, and that consideration would
<col>170</col>
shew them that the proposed clauses involved the greatest inconsistencies, absurdities, and even impossibilities. As to the preamble, nothing could reconcile him to it. No good could be expected from it, while it might be attended with much mischief: he was, therefore, for leaving it out altogether. As to the consequences of the measure, they certainly appeared to him most alarming. If ever St. Domingo and Cuba were in the hands of our enemies, and if they resolved to carry on this trade, that alarm would prove but too well founded. He would even venture to say, that it was to the existence of the slave trade that their lordships were indebted for their being now sitting in that house. Our existence depended on the strength of our navy, and the strength of our navy was chiefly derived from the slave trade. Their lordships must be convinced of it, if they but reflected that the town of Liverpool alone now sent out a greater number of privateers than were employed by the whole of the country against the enemy, in the time of Queen Elizabeth.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Marquis of Sligo</member> <membercontribution>disapproved of the clauses, and contended, that the preamble contained a gross calumny.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Norfolk</member> <membercontribution>was not very anxious on former ocasions to support the measure of the abolition; because he knew that many of those who were loudest in its praise, were far from being sincere in their wishes for its success. Now, however, when it was taken up by ministers who had his confidence, and, who, he was satisfied, were incapable of any duplicity, the bill should have his most cordial support, and he should rejoice to see it pass.&#x2014;The question was now put on the several amendments, and agreed to.&#x2014;Lord Grenville then moved, that the bill, with the amendments, &amp;c. as agreed to, be sent to the commons, and on the motion being agreed to,&#x2014;his lordship again rose, and congratulated the house on having now performed one of the most glorious acts that had ever been done by any assembly of any nation in the world.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>A message from the lords, announced their lordships' assent to the mutiny bill, and the sugar drawback.&#x2014; Mr Whitbread observing that he had on a former evening stated it as his opinion that W. Drake had not received his wound in the battle of Camperdown, declared that a do.

<col>171</col>
cument had since been put into his hands, by which it was proved that that person had actually lost his leg from a hurt received in that action. This document was a letter from captain Bligh of the Director, to Mr. Bewick, then Chairman of a committee at Lloyd's for the relief of the sufferers in that action. He begged, therefore, to be understood as retracting his assertion, and he would move for documents to explain the circumstance; but lest any false impression should go abroad, that when those papers should be produced, he would propose the liberation of the prisoner, he would observe, that the circumstance which he had just mentioned was not the only misrepresentation and falsehood contained in Mr. Drake's evidence. There were numerous others; among the rest he had declared, that he had never applied for relief to the admiralty, when in fact he had done so to the very person by whom he had been questioned. He therefore would first move for copies of all communications made by capt. Bligh, late of the Director, to N. Bewick, esq. chairman of the committee at Lloyd's, for the relief of wounded seamen. The Speaker observed, with regard to the latter part of the motion, that the Society were not known to that house, and therefore could not form part of a motion from the Chair. Mr. Windham concurred in this opinion, declaring, that however good the intentions of the society alluded to, it would be very improper that it should be recognized in that house. Mr. Fuller seemed to think that Drake ought to be liberated. After a few words from Mr. Rose, and Mr. Jeffery, Mr. Whitbread withdrew his motion on account of the improper recognition which it contained; but in reply to Mr. Fuller's observations, repeated, that the imprisonment of Mr. Drake, was not in consequence of the circumstance alone which he had just cleared up.&#x2014;On the motion of Mr. Whitbread, the following papers were then ordered to be laid before the house: a copy of the Smart Ticket produced by. Mr. Drake, whereby he received a pension from the chest of Greenwich: also, a copy of the Sick Ticket sent by capt. Bligh, late. of his Majesty's ship Director, to the hospital at Yarmouth.&#x2014;Mr. Bankes gave notice of a motion tomorrow respecting places granted in reversion. Lord Howick assured his hon. friend, that he should have his most complete support. Not a single reversion had been given away by the present adminis-

<p><member>[CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION] Lord Euston</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition from the chancellor, masters, and scholars, of the University of Cambridge, taking notice of the bill for enabling his Majesty to avail himself of the services of all his liege subjects in his naval and military forces, in the manner therein mentioned; and setting forth, that the petitioners are anxious to express their serious apprehensions of the danger likely to arise from the said bill if carried into a law, to the established constitution of this country both in church and state, not only because it might eventually,place a dangerous power in the hands of those persons whose tenets are not friendly to our ecclesiastical establishment, but also because the principle of the bill leads to the total abolition of the Test act, and to other still more alarming consequences; and therefore praying, that the said bill may not pass into a law. On his lordship's moving that the petition do lie on the table,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Dickenson rose</member> <membercontribution>not to oppose the motion of the noble lord, but in the fulfilment of his duty as a member of parliament to put a plain and simple question to the noble lord opposite (lord Howick). Twelve or thirteen days ago, that noble lord introduced into the House a bill (against which the petition that had just been presented was directed) enabling his majesty to accept the services of all his liege subjects, of every religious persuasion, in the army and navy. About five days since the noble lord intimated that it was not his intention to carry into execution the order for the second reading of the bill, but to allow it to drop, to be afterwards disposed of as the house might think fit. The noble lord stated, that this intimation was owing to circumstances which it was not then in his power to disclose, but which at some future time he would explicitly narrate. He wished to ask, if that time had arrived? The public mind was in a state of great anxiety. Many rumours were afloat respecting a Change in the Administration: without any wish for such a change having been expres-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0102"/>
<col>173</col>
sed by the people, or any intimation for the necessity of it having proceeded from that house (hear! hear!). Among others, a rumour had been circulated, that his majesty's ministers had endeavoured to press on his majesty a subject to which the honourable and conscientious mind of his majesty was averse. (Hear! hear!) Was that rumour true? He (Mr. D.) had obtained leave to quit London for a fortnight. He should see many of his constituents at the assizes, and he wished to be enabled satisfactorily to answer the questions that would naturally be put to him. He thought it unnecessary to offer any excuse for this intrusion on the house, the particular circumstances in which the country was placed, he trusted, would justify him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>replied nearly in the following terms: Sir, certainly no apology was necessary from the hon. gent. for the exercise of one of the first privileges of a member of parliament, that of calling upon his majesty's ministers for explanation upon any great and important subject. In answer to the hon. gent's. questions, I shall declare, as far as I can, consistently with my duty, what is the present state of the administration of this country, adding only, that, with regard to those circumstances which I do not at present feel at liberty to divulge, I shall rely on the candour and indulgence of the house, trusting they will believe that no man is more anxious, than myself that my conduct should stand fair with the house and with the country; and consequently, that the time must come when my duty to the king end to the public, and every consideration of private honour will induce me to make an explicit statement of the recent occurrences. In the mean time, I shall proceed, under the restrictions which I have mentioned, to reply to the questions of the hon. gent. To one of those questions I do not feel authorised at present to give an answer: it is that one which alluded to a rumour, which, if true, would, as the hon. gent. has implied, impute culpability to his majesty's ministers, namely, that his majesty's ministers had endeavoured to force on the king a measure which his conscience disapproved. On this point I will only say, that it is the duty of any minister, on any subject connected with the interests of this great empire. to offer such advice to his majesty as his judgment shall dictate. More I cannot now say. With regard to the other question proposed by the hon. gent., it only remains for me to add to the
<col>174</col>
statement which I made when I signified, my intention of not moving for the second reading of the religious army service bill, that the circumstances which then prevented me from doing so have led to a situation in which I am now enabled to inform the house that, although I have not yet received his majesty's commands to deliver up the seals of my office, his majesty has thought proper to send for persons not employed as his servants, and is engaged in forming arrangements for a new administration.&#x2014;The petition was then ordered to lie on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[CARNATIC PAPERS.] Sir T. Turton</member>, <membercontribution>in a speech of considerable length, which be prefaced by observing, that no change of administration could in any measure affect the question now before the house, inveighed strongly against the assumption of the government of the Carnatic, which he repeatedly termed one of the most gross and infamous stretches of tyranny that ever disgraced the annals of India. He dwelt much upon the subsequent treatment of the Polygars, who, he contended, were no more subjects of Britain than of Hesse Cassel He did not charge the lords Clive or Wellesley with the murder of the nabob of Arcot, but insisted that both had been the means of bringing about that murder. The hon. baronet concluded with moving, that there be laid before the house a copy of the instructions given to lord Mornington by the Board of Controul or the Secret Committee, previous to the Treaty respecting the Carnatic in 1792. The hon. baronet said, that beside. one now before the house, he had upon the same subject twelve other motions to submit to the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney </member>, <membercontribution>in answer to the hon. baronet's long speech, should briefly observe, that of the papers now called for, one part did not exist, and the other part was already printed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>said, that not being in the office of the right hon. gent., he had not the same means of information, and therefore was not aware of what had been just mentioned. He thought the right hon. gent. answer a fair one, and was willing to withdraw his motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord A. Hamilton</member> <membercontribution>thought it better that the proper officers be required to lay before the house a copy of all the instructions that had been issued.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>contended that ,all the instructions which had been transmitted, were already in possession of the house.</membercontribution></p>

<col>175</col>
<p><member>Col. Symes</member> <member>asserted that there would not be time in the present session to examine all the papers for which the hon. baronet had moved. Though he had given a long explanation of the object of these motions, yet the explanation was so imperfect, that he could not pretend to understand him. Yet there were one or two observations in his statement which he could not pass over without some notice&#x2014;Sir T. Turton rose to order, affirming that the hon, gent. ought to confine himself to the particular question before the house.&#x2014;After a few words from sir J. Anstruther, Mr. Tierney and col. Symes, the motion was agreed to.&#x2014;The motion for a copy of the Review promised by marquis Wellesley to the Directors was then put and carried, it being understood that there was no such paper, but sir T. Turton wishing to have that fact formerly before the house.</member></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>also moved for copies of the official Letters, other than that of the 23d April 1800, respecting the papers discovered at Seringapatam, with the answers so far as not already printed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Col. Symes</member> <membercontribution>contended that the greatest moderation had been practised in acting on these papers. He denied that the papers had been come by unfairly, or that any improper means had been used to shorten the life of the nabob, who was said not to have died a natural death. He died in consequence of the intemperate use of opium. The governor of Madras sent Dr. Anderson to him when ill, whose report was, that he found him labouring under an incurable dysentery.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>would not now enter upon the merits, but he was at issue with the hon. gent. in the whole of his statements. Motion agreed to.&#x2014;He next moved for a copy of the Paper containing the approbation given of the conduct of lord Clive in the transaction above alluded to, and in the subsequent arrangements with respect to the Prince. Agreed to.&#x2014;The hon, baronet also moved for copies of the Letters of Omdut Ul Omrah, &amp;c. complaining of grievances. Ordered. He next moved for a copy of a Letter from lord Hobart to Omdut Ul Omrah, complaining of the permission given by him to certain artizans, &amp;c. servants of the company, to settle in his dominions.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Anstruther</member> <membercontribution>said, there was no such paper, and that it was not respectful to the house to be moving for papers which it was known did not exist.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Symes</member> <membercontribution>observed, that gentlemen
<col>176</col>
might exercise their imagination to the great inconvenience of the house, if these things were permitted.&#x2014;The house then divided on this question, which was lost by a majority of 30 to 24. The other motions were agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>A Message from the lords declared their lordship's assent to the amendments made by the house on the Bill for the Abolition of the Slave-trade, with the correction of a clerical error in one of them.&#x2014;The amendment of the house of lords was agreed to, after a particular explanation from the Speaker, who stated it to be the practice of the house to allow such amendments, when they went only to express more fully, and to further their own intentions, as the amendment in the present case did, going only to supply a clerical omission.&#x2014;Lord Temple moved that the amendments of the lords in the Sierra Leone Company bill should be taken into consideration. The Speaker felt it his duty to call the attention of the house to the subject of these amendments. This bill, proposing to vest lands in the crown, struck him to be of the same nature of a money bill; and if in the one or the other the lords should introduce any amendments, it appeared to him that, according to the privileges of that house, such amendments were fatal to the bill. He supposed, therefore, that some member of that house would move, that this bill should be laid aside. Lord Temple in conformity with the opinion of the chair, moved that this bill should be thrown out; which was agreed to. The noble lord then moved, that the house should tomorrow resolve into a committee upon the acts relative to the Sierra Leone company, with the view of moving for leave to bring in a bill of the same nature as that which had been just rejected&#x2014;Mr. Vansittart rose to state, that an hon. gent., (Mr. Osborn Markham) who was a member of the Shrewsbury election committee, having vacated his seat in consequence of his acceptance of a certain appointment, he submitted, for the consideration of the house, how the committee were to act under such an event? The Speaker felt that the right hon. gent. had done right in communicating the information which the house had just heard. But as to the subject of that information it was his duty to state, that a member's vacating his seat in consequence of his acceptance of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0104"/>
<col>177</col>
an office which was incompatible with such seat, or from any other natural cause, was no reason why the committee alluded to should not proceed in its investigation, nor could the house prevent, upon such grounds, any such committee from proceeding.&#x2014;Mr. Lethbridge presented a petition from John Palmer, Esq. of Bath, the original deviser of the mail coach conveyance of letters. The petition stated an agreement having been made, several years ago, between the said John Palmer, and certain persons then in office in his majesty's government, which agreement had never been performed by the said persons, whereby the said John Palmer was greatly injured. It concluded with praying relief. Ordered to lie on the table.&#x2014;A new writ was ordered for a member to serve in parliament for the borough of Calne, in the room of Osborne Markham Esq. who had accepted the office of Commissioner of Barracks.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[LANCASTER ELECTION.] Mr. Dent</member> <membercontribution>called the attention of the house to a circumstance which occurred relative to this election, which greatly involved the privileges of that house. A petition had been presented against him, as one of the sitting members for that town, charging him with bribery and corruption, and loading him with all those epithets which petitions of that description usually contain. It was, however, permitted to drop, but not until he had been put to very considerable trouble and some expence, in preparations to resist it; in doing which he discovered, that five of the persons petitioning against him were not at Lancaster; and he found that there was not the smallest chance of even obtaining that redress which the law of this country gives in cases of forfeited recognizances, as the party so entering into such recognizances on this occasion did not appear to be worth sixpence. He further discovered that warrants, as from the speaker, to attend the committee in town, had been served on several persons, five or six of whom were in attendance then in the lobby, but that all these warrants had been forged; that a person well known to a right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Tierney) appeared as the solicitor conducting his petition, and the ostensible agent of the petitioners; that the warrants were discovered to be forged, on application at the office of the speaker's secretary; that they were dated the 26th of Feb., whereas none were issued from that depart-
<col>178</col>
ment until the 4th of March; and that Mr. John Alcock, of the Borough, was the person to whom he alluded as the ostensible agent of the petitioners.&#x2014;Here the hon. member was proceeding to submit a motion on the subject, when </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>suggested the propriety of merely mentioning a future day for taking the matter into consideration, and at present moving, that the offending parties be upon that day ordered to attend.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dent</member> <membercontribution>then observed, that to-morrow would equally answer the ends of justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney</member> <membercontribution>did not rise to oppose any enquiry which the house might make upon the business, but merely to say, that he thought to-morrow would be too soon, as it might not be possible for Mr. Alcock, in so short a time, to have an opportunity of justifying himself. He certainly could not, and would not disavow his knowledge of that gentleman, and since he was thus publicly noticed as having such knowledge of him, he would add, that he believed him an upright and honest man.&#x2014;After some desultory remarks from other members, it was at last ordered, that Mr John Alcock do attend the house to-morrow together with other persons named in the order.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[RESOLUTION RESP CTING OFFICES IN REVERSION.] Mr. Bankes</member> <membercontribution>said he was not aware that the motion he was about to offer was liable to any objection. It came recommended, not by his individual authority, but by the sanction of the committee of the house appointed "to examine and consider what regulations and checks have been established, in order to controul the several branches of the public expenditure in Great Britain and Ireland, and how far the same have been effectual, and what further measures can be adopted for reducing any part of the said expenditure, or diminishing the amount of salaries end emoluments without detriment to the public service" It occurred to the committee, in furtherance of the object committed to its care, that grants of offices in reversion, though not exceeding the grants that had been made in former times, ought to be restricted, and put a stop to. In Ireland, which had lately become united with this country, and was equally entitled to attention, the practice of granting reversions prevailed to an infinitely greater extent. The practice was an abuse, so far as it prevailed, and it was an abuse likely to be extended, if some timely check was not imposed upon it. He was therefore
<image src="S1V0009P0I0105"/>
<col>179</col>
directed by the committee, as its chairman, to move a resolution, "That no office, place, employment, or salary, in any part of his majesty's dominions, ought hereafter to be granted in reversion."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Yorke</member> <membercontribution>gave every possible credit to the motives of his hon. friend and of the committee, and yet he felt a good deal of difficulty in assenting to this motion. The doubt in his mind was, whether the ancient and accustomed practice ought to be altered, when, as stated by his hon. friend himself, it had of late been but little abused. It was a favourite maxim with him, not to change established usages unless he saw some strong reason for it. This granting of offices in reversion had been a power in the hands of the crown for the purpose of rewarding services; and hitherto it had in fact been a saving to the public; for unless these offices could be given in this manner, services, if they were rewarded at all, must be rewarded by a grant, and a double burthen would thus be laid upon the public. The object of this motion, as had been stated, was undoubtedly of the greatest importance; and yet the house was called upon to decide upon it at once. The notice had only been given the preceding day, and given in such a manner that till he came down that day, he did not exactly know the purport of it. He hoped therefore that the house would at least take more time to consider of it. If the motion had been for leave to bring in a bill, he should have had no objection to it, because he could then have stated his objections in the different stages, provided he thought it was liable to objection. But as the motion was for a resolution, he was inclined to dissent from it; for even though it should be followed by a bill, those arguing against that bill would be under an evident disadvantage when such a resolution as this stood on the journals. He hoped therefore the motion would be postponed, if not, he should be under the necessity of giving it his negative.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>gave his most cordial support to the motion. He saw nothing in the arguments of the rt. hon. gent. who spoke last, to induce him to think it ought to be postponed. The notice given yesterday in one of the fullest houses of the session, and particularly marked by his (lord H.'s) saying he would support the motion, and adding, what he repeated now, that not one single reversion had been given away by the present administration, though some very valuable ones had fallen in, was, in his opi-
<col>180</col>
nion, as ample a notice as could be desired. It had, however, been stated in objection to what he then said, that some offices had been granted in reversion in the court of chancery. What he had said ought to be understood of the government, and not of the subordinate departments. The fact, with respect to these reversions in the court of chancery, was, that the present lord chancellor had advised his majesty to grant the reversion of two small offices in his court to a person who had been his clerk, while he was in such distinguished practice at the bar, and who, losing that employment by his promotion to the seals, would be wholly unprovided for without this grant in reversion. This was the only grant in reversion that had been made, though a tellership had fallen in. No custom should be allowed to sanction a thing, which, in the opinion of correct men of all ages, was improper. It was not necessary to argue the impropriety of the practice now; many better opportunities would occur in the various stages of the bill that would be introduced on the resolution. The right hon. gent. had said, that this would reduce the power of the crown to reward services, and that it would increase the expense of those rewards, by rendering it necessary to make all remuneration the subject of present grant. The rt. hon. gent. had looked but slightly on this matter, or he would have found, that grants of reversions had usually been made, not to meritorious servants, but to persons, who, from their tender age, could have rendered no services whatever. The grant of reversions was, in fact, an abridgment of the means of rewarding public servants; for if the holder of the office dropped, the reversioner stepped in, and prevented its being given to a meritorious servant. Thus the public burthens were increased, instead of being, as the rt. hon. gent. argued, diminished by grants in reversion. He approved of the mode by which the committee proposed to establish this barrier, as well as of the barrier itself. While the bill, which was to impose a permanent restriction, was in progress, a resolution of the house would be sufficient to deter any minister from granting the reversions which the bill proposed to render illegal. He was not prepared to go into the question, whether the restriction was more or less called for now. He could not say, whether grants in reversion had been more or less frequent in late years; but several grants had been made in late years, and particularly in Ireland. He gave
<image src="S1V0009P0I0106"/>
<col>181</col>
his cordial support to the motion, and he wished the house to go still further, and to come to a resolution against the granting of any office for life, not usually so granted. If any thing of that kind had been done, or was in contemplation, he thought it highly proper for the house to interfere, and to prevent it, by expressing its decided disapprobation. (Hear! hear! from many parts of the house, but from the Treasury Benches in particular.)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plumer (of Hertford) rose</member> <membercontribution>and said: I wish, sir, that this measure had been brought forward 40 years ago. This has been hitherto my sincere desire; and I, therefore, give the motion now made my most hearty assent. Having said thus much upon the measure itself, I cannot help embracing this opportunity of paying a tribute of applause to the present administration (I say present, upon the supposition that they are still in office), as I really think they have shewn every disposition to benefit the country by their judicious measures, and their avoiding the practice of former administrations, of granting reversions. Upon this occasion, too, I have another observation to make, which is this: in coming down to the house this day, I have heard a report, which I am very sorry to hear; I have heard, sir, that the new government which is now forming, or to be formed, have agreed to give to an hon. and learned member of this house (alluding to Mr. Perceval, who was not then in the house) an appointment to the Duchy of Lancaster for life, in order to tempt that gentleman to take a place in the new government. Upon this, I may observe, that if men of great abilities are not satisfied with the rewards attached to the situations which his majesty chooses to appoint them to hold in the government of their country, if they do not think the usual compensation sufficient, they ought not to accept of office at all. I do, however, at all events, enter my protest most solemnly against the measure of giving a man a situation for life, in order to entice him to occupy another, which may be more fleeting and temporary. (Loud cries of hear! hear!)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>wished this resolution had been adopted a year sooner. The house would not taken be in the situation in which it now was, with respect to some of the Irish offices which had been reported as proper, some to be abolished, and some to be reformed, and which could not be touched in either way, on account of the interests of the reversioners. The office of customer and
<col>182</col>
collector of the Port of Dublin, one of those reported as requiring regulation and reform, had been granted in reversion two deep, and consequently could not be touched by the late bill for the retrenchment, reform, and regulation of offices in Ireland, though it had twice fallen vacant within the year, and though it was one of those that most particularly required reform and regulation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>approved of the motion, which was perfectly consistent with the principles on which his hon. friend (Mr. Bankes) had always acted, and he thought it was a happy omen of what might be expected from the exertions of the committee of which he was chairman. He could not, however, think a mere unauthenticated rumour a sufficient justification for what had been said of an hon. and learned gent. not now present, the whole tenor of whose life had shewn his preference of public principle to private advantage. He could not help observing too, that those who had been most clamorous in cheering the reflections cast on the hon. and learned gentlemen, were members of a family which was loaded with wealth derived from public sinecures. He wished, with the hon. gent. on the floor, that the resolution now before the house had been adopted 40 years ago, and then that family would not now be drawing &#x00A3;60,000 a year from the labour of the public. But however eager they had hitherto been for places and pensions, he was glad that at last they had found it expedient to change their tone.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plumer </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, allowed that the mere rumour of the day was not a sufficient ground for calling the attention of the house to any thing: but after the allusion made by the noble lord opposite, he thought himself justified in the observations he had offered. As to the rest of what had fallen from the hon. gent. it did not touch him, He was not one of the family which was loaded with wealth derived from the public. If the report was unfounded, what he had said could do no harm: if the report was true, what he had said might do much good.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty </member>, <membercontribution>though he approved of the present motion, rose not so much for the purpose of expressing that approbation, as with a view to apologize to the house for not having brought forward the subject himself. He entertained the same opinion with the committee some time ago, and intended to have made a similar motion, and for that purpose had moved for an account of the offices granted in reversion, which was now
<image src="S1V0009P0I0107"/>
<col>183</col>
on the table. He had, he believed, given no notice of his intention, but he had only not proposed the bill before, as he had not been aware of any immediate necessity for it. He had assurances on the subject, and in favour of his view of it, from the noble duke at the head of affairs in Ireland, and from the noble lord here too, to whom the hon. gent. (Mr Johnstone) had alluded. He had with singular propriety adverted to that noble lord in the language of reproach on that day, when it was well known that he had power to grant a considerable office in reversion, and yet that the only use he made of it was to abstain from exercising a privilege which had been used by every one who preceded him. That noble lord had already laid down in practice what it was now proposed to lay down in theory, and therefore the hon. gent's. allusion was peculiarly well timed. When he approved of the resolutions now moved, he ought to recollect that Lord Grenville had already acted upon the principle. It was not therefore by those who followed the practice of granting offices in reversion, that the resolution was loudly approved of, notwithstanding the hon. gent's. insinuation, but by those who abstained from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Henry Martin <memberconstituency>(of Kinsale)</memberconstituency></member> <membercontribution>said, he so fully coincided in the propriety of the resolution now before the house, and felt it so necessary to counteract a system so mischievous as that which had been alluded to this night, that he should now give notice, that he would to-morrow move an humble address to his majesty, praying, that he would be graciously pleased not to grant any place in the duchy of Lancaster, or elsewhere, for life, which had hitherto been usually held by the possessors during his majesty's pleasure. (Hear! hear! from all parts of the house.)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Gascoyne</member> <membercontribution>disapproved of the bringing forward this resolution at present; because he thought it looked very suspicious, and had the appearance of being intended to restrict the new government. In the absence of all those, who, according to report, were to have a share in that government, it was not proper to press it. No notice had been given of it, that must necessarily have reached them. At all events, though it should pass at present, that must not be considered as a pledge to support the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Horner </member>, <membercontribution>as a member of the committee, felt himself called upon to say a few words on the present occasion. As the hon. general had insinuated that this motion had
<col>184</col>
been brought forward with a view to recent and present circumstances, he begged leave to inform that hon. general and the house, that the subject, respecting the grant of places in reversion, had been the first to which the attention of the committee had been directed. It had been several times under discussion, and the last time their attention had been called to it, it was warmly supported by an hon. gent. who was likely to have a place under the new arrangement. The insinuation, that this resolution was intended as a restriction on the persons included in the new arrangement, appeared to him extraordinary, as coming from an hon. gent. professing himself the friend of those members.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Gascoyne </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, disclaimed any intention to throw any imputation whatever upon the committee. He had only said, that the manner in which the resolution had been brought forward and argued, excited in his mind a suspicion that it was intended as a restriction on the new arrangement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>observed that the hon. general certainly had not thrown, by his speech, any censure upon the measure now proposed; but he had thrown a very severe imputation upon his friends in the new administration; and one for which he believed at least, they would be very little obliged to the zeal of the hon. general. For his own part, though the new ministers were about to occupy those places from which himself and his colleagues must shortly retreat, yet he had so little of political animosity towards them, that he was unwilling to impute to them any such intentions as those which the zeal of the hon. general this night bespoke. He hoped they were actuated by stronger motives for accession to power, than those of bargaining and buying their way into office. The hon. general's reasonings amounted to this: "if you attempt to carry a resolution of this sort, you will throw the strongest impediment in the way of forming a new and virtuous administration, to succeed the wicked and corrupt one just turned out of office: you will paralize the vigour of their exertions: you will cripple the magnitude of their plans, if you prevent them from taking, or granting lucrative places in reversion, or for life, in addition to those they are to hold during the king's pleasure, in remuneration for their great services and splendid talents." This, however, was a doctrine to which he could not subscribe, and a kind of support from the hon. general, which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0108"/>
<col>185</col>
he believed, would not be very grateful to his friends. Some allusion had been made in the course of this discussion, to certain reversions held by a distinguished family, several branches of which formed parts of the present administration; but he could see no analogy between the cases alluded to, and those now in contemplation of the house; between reversions during pleasure, enjoyed for services long rendered to the state, and reversions and places for life, to be granted in the first instance before any service whatever was rendered, and given as a kind of bounty to entice a placeman to enlist for a high office, to which also a high salary was to be attached This was indeed a novel mode of recruiting an administration. But whenever the new ministers should appear in their places, he hoped the hon. general would give them a very different support from the kind of observations he had this day pointed against them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>was sure that the character and principles of his hon. friend, who had brought forward the resolution, would secure him from the imputation of having been actuated by party motives. From what he had learned in conversation with other members of the committee, he was persuaded that they were all agreed that no places should be granted henceforth in reversion. As to the propriety of any arrangements with a view to induce individuals to accept of office, he believed that the first measure of the administration then in office, with a view to enable a noble lord (Grenville), for whom he felt a very sincere respect, was a sufficient proof that such an arrangement was not very extraordinary. As to the new administration, he knew nothing more of it, than he was enabled to collect from the rumours afloat, and he did not believe that any arrangement had been yet submitted for the approbation of the highest authority in the state.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>observed, that without giving any opinion upon the merits of the case referred to by the hon. gent. (Mr. Johnstone), he had no hesitation in asserting that there was a material difference between that case and the one more particularly alluded to, in the course of this debate. For in the one, the object was to enable a man to hold an office which was conferred upon him for life, in conjunction with one to which he was appointed during pleasure, and for that purpose the sanction of parliament was applied for, and obtained; while in the other the proposition was, that an office
<col>186</col>
heretofore held during pleasure, should he conferred for life, and that too at the mere will of the crown, in order, as rumour stated, to induce a man to accept another office during pleasure. With regard to the noble family alluded to by the hon gent. as holding places of considerable profit, did the hon. gent. mean to assert that the holding places of profit by public men was inconsistent with the purity of public character? If the hon. gent. did mean that, such a sentiment must be heard with peculiar surprise from such a quarter, after the panegyric which the hon. gent. had thought proper to pronounce upon the public spirit and patriotism of his right hon. friend. For that hon. gent. must know that one of the highest places of profit in the country was granted in reversion to a person of the name of Perceval; and again in reversion to another person of the same name. The hon. gent. expressed his heartfelt approbation of the measure, which the motion before the house had in view, and in concurrence with the hon. member, his regret that such a measure had not been introduced forty years ago In alluding to the hon. mover, he could not help expressing his surprise, that any man who had the least opportunity of appreciating the character of that hon. gent. could suppose him capable of binding himself to the purposes of any party. The house indeed must have heard with astonishment the imputation which an hon. gent. on the other side had thought proper to throw out. The hon. member concluded with declaring his cordial concurrence in the motion before the house, against which he had not heard a single argument, and his anxious wish for the success of the motion of which his hon. friend (Mr. Martin) had given notice for the next day.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>in explanation stated, that he did not mean to assert a complete analogy between the case of the noble lord alluded to (lord Grenville) and that which appeared to be so much in view in the present discussion. Probably he merely meant to infer from the former case, that in the contemplation of ministerial arrangements, the nature of an office might be changed by connecting it with one with which it was previously deemed altogether incompatible. To be sure in one case the change could be effected only by the sanction of parliament, whereas in the other it was quite subject to the will of the king.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Parnell</member> <membercontribution>thought that it behoved the house to take peculiar care upon a question of this nature. For, understanding that a
<image src="S1V0009P0I0109"/>
<col>187</col>
noble lord (Castlereagh) was likely to hold a leading situation in the new administration, whose conduct in Ireland could not escape his recollection, he was fully convinced of the necessity of vigilant precaution. He (Mr. Parnell) had had the honour of a seat in the house of commons in Ireland during the discussions upon the Union, and he remembered that in the first session, when that measure was proposed and lost, two families of some parliamentary influence stood neuter. But in the following session, under this noble lord's management of reversions, these two families were brought into action, and by such means the union was voted by a small majority. A son of one of these families was, to his knowledge, secured in the reversion of the clerkship of the pells in Ireland, and to a son of the other family he imagined that a reversion of a more serious nature was promised, for the first bishopric that became vacant was assigned to him. With these facts in his recollection, and with the prospect now before the house, he thought that every practicable guard against corruption ought to be established.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>disclaimed any intention to assert any thing so absurd, as that the holding of a public place of profit was incompatible with the purity of public character. He only meant to say, that it afforded him great satisfaction to hear a motion of this nature so loudly applauded by men who were themselves loaded with so much of the public money. It was a good omen, and he hoped it would not prove delusive.&#x2014;The resolution was then agreed to, and Mr. Bankes, Mr. Horner, and Mr. S. Bourne, were appointed to prepare and bring in a bill pursuant thereto.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.]&#x2014;Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for a committee on the Scotch Judicature bill,&#x2014;
<col>188</col>
The house having resolved itself into a committee, the noble lord stated his intention of moving, pursuant to the instruction of the committee, to divide the bill into two, and also of proposing several amendments in that part of it which related to the chambers of the court of session, and to the court of review. With respect to the latter court, some persons had thought that it would be an additional step in the progress of litigation, inasmuch as the unsuccessful parties would still appeal to that house, and therefore that the number of appeals to that house would not be lessened. There was one mode, however, he thought, which would materially tend to lessen the number of appeals to that house, namely, to abolish reclaiming petitions in the court of session, and to substitute, instead, appeals to the court of review. This would naturally tend to produce a more complete adjudication of causes in the chambers of the court of session, there being no opportunity, as at present, of 
re-examining their own decisions, whilst there was every reason to believe that that careful adjudication would render appeals less frequent. Of one part of the bill he thought an unfair advantage had been taken out of the house, as he never had an idea that the extraordinary lords to be added to the court of session should hold their places in any other manner than like the judges of England, during good behaviour. He had no objection, if it was thought necessary, to the introduction of clauses, enacting that the persons to be so appointed should have all the requisite qualifications.&#x2014;After few obserservations from lord Eldon, the amendments were agreed to. In the progress of the bill, lord Grenville stated that upon further consideration, it had been thought inexpedient to prohibit, altogether, appeals from interlocutors; and therefore he proposed to give a power to the court of review to receive appeals from interlocutors, and also on receiving an appeal from final judgment to call for all the interlocutors in the cause. An amendment was adopted to this effect, and the first part of the bill, relating to the chambers of the court of session and the, court of review, having been separated from the rest, the house resumed, and the report was ordered to be received the next day.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Eldon</member> <membercontribution>moved for the appointment of a committee to inquire where the judges of the court of session should be placed during their attendance on the house, and to search for precedents, &amp;c. His reason for moving this was, that <ob/>he judges of the court of

<p><member>[MINUTES.]&#x2014;Lord G. Cavendish </member><membercontribution>reported from the Lanark committee, that the sitting member, sir Charles Ross, was duly elected; and that the petition was not frivolous nor vexatious.&#x2014;Mr. Long moved, that a new writ should be issued for a member for the borough of Plympton, in the room of lord Castlereagh, who had accepted the office of one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state; and also, for the borough of Newton, in the room of Mr. Canning, who had accepted the office of one of the principal secretaries of state. Ordered.&#x2014;Lord Howick adverted to the promise which he had given of an explanation with respect to the change of administration. To-morrow there would be a motion for an adjournment for some days, and he was unwilling that the house should separate without the explanation being given. He therefore gave notice that he would give that explanation the next day.&#x2014;Sir S. Romilly, pursuant to notice, moved for leave to bring in a bill to render the Freehold Estates of traders liable to the Bankrupt laws dying indebted assets for the payment of their simple contract debts. As there seemed a general concurrence that a bill of this nature would be unobjectionable, he need not enter upon the grounds of the motion. He was sorry that the other bill bad been lost; but since he could not do all the good he wished, he most at least endeavour to do all the good he could. The motion was then put and carried.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH BUDGET.]</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;The house resolved itself into a committee of Ways and Means.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member>, <membercontribution>conscious how little claim he had to occupy the attention of the house at any time, but much less at the present, said he should endeavour to make his statements as briefly as possible; nor should he have to trouble the committee on the subject, if it had not been for the circumstance of his having so great a share in negociating the Loan last Monday for Ireland. The hon. baronet then briefly stated the different items of the Supplies for Ireland, composed of its separate charges, and its two-seven-teenth parts of the joint charge of the empire, which made the whole charge amount to &#x00A3;9,561,218. Part of the loan for Ireland had been contracted for with the English
<col>190</col>
Loan, the remainder he wished to have separately contracted for, because he was anxious that it should be made payable at the Bank of Ireland, for the purpose of obviating the inconveniences that were felt from the Irish government, they being obliged to draw upon this country for the money. The terms, however, which had been offered by the gentlemen who were bidders for that loan, were such as it had not been thought right to accept. The loan was, therefore, contracted for by the gentlemen who took the English Loan, upon an advance of 1<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. per cent. interest, which, he trusted, would not under these circumstances be thought material. The Ways and Means, by which he proposed to cover these Supplies, consisting of the loans, of the Revenue of Ireland, which he took at the same as last year, viz. &#x00A3;3,882,790; surplus of the Consolidated Fond, &#x00A3;500,000; one million of Treasury Bills; and &#x00A3;300,000 which he proposed by New Taxes and Regulations, amounted in all to &#x00A3;9,685,093 which left an excess of Ways and Means, over the Supply, of &#x00A3;123,875.

Though the Sugar Duty imposed last session had failed to produce, the other duties had amply supplied the deficiency. The hon. bart. here enumerated the proportion in which each duty had exceeded in produce the amount calculated. Of the arrears and balances due of dead or removed collectors, &#x00A3;17,600 had been recovered within the last year; but this sum was considerably less than would be recovered in future years, if the measures should be persevered in for two or three years. The sum of the arrears appeared greater this year than last year, in consequence of an arrear that had accrued in the hands of the Collector of Maryborough; before he had been himself in office to the amount of &#x00A3;20,000, orders had been issued

to the Board of Excise, to reduce the balances in the hands of Collectors under &#x00A3;100. From this statement, he trusted, it would be manifest to the committee, that the Irish government had not abused the confidence that had been placed in it. They had a vote of credit for &#x00A3;400,000, and they had issued but &#x00A3;76,000. Measures had been taken for the reduction of 38 offices in the customs, and for carrying into effect the suggestions of the Committee of Inquiry. The trade of Ireland had improved in the last year, though there appeared a diminution in its exports.

Which, added to the decrease in the Imports, made the improvement in the Trade of Ireland within the last year considerably above a million. The Trade to America had increased one third. The shipping of Ireland had increased in number 1&#x2013;6, in tonnage 1&#x2013;9, in seamen 1&#x2013;3; the British shipping trading with Ireland had also increased 1&#x2013;12, whilst the foreign shipping bad decreased 1&#x2013;10, a circumstance which shewed, that the advantage of the whole increase of the trade remained within the empire. The Exchange had also fallen to 9&#x00BD; per cent. a rate much lower than had been known for many years.

<p><member>[AFFAIRS OF INDIA.]&#x2014;Sir Philip Francis</member> <membercontribution>wished to call the attention of the house to a subject of the greatest importance, and for that purpose rose to ask some questions of the president of the board of controul, or of the person who had lately filled that situation. On the subject to which he alluded, he could speak, perhaps, with more knowledge than any Who had heard him. It related to the state of India. He was not so vain nor so ill instructed by experience, as to imagine that any thing he could say would make any very strong impression on the house, or rouse them to give a more than ordinary attention to the subject which it was his object to press upon
<col>192</col>
their most serious consideration. But though experience had almost deprived him of hope on this point, yet there were some duties that survived even hope, and this was one of them. The questions which he was about to ask, were merely with a view to procure information, and it would depend on the answers, whether he should think it necessary to render them the grounds of any subsequent motion. The first question, then, was, why the accounts on which the East India Budget must be founded, were not as yet on the table, for the house must be aware that it was now three years since the last view of the state of India Finances had been given on full and authentic documents. This was a point of great importance, and worthy of the serious attention of the house. But this was not what he had particularly in view at this time, and the material object of his rising, was to obtain information on a subject which ought to be before the house. The first part related to the transaction at Vellore; a transaction, melancholy and disastrous in its immediate effects, and to the last degree dangerous, with a view to its ultimate consequences. Whether, therefore, we looked back upon the past, or forward to the future, it was essentially necessary, that on this point the house should be in possession of some authentic information, and he hoped that ministers, whoever they were, would not withhold that information. Addressing himself, then, to the right hon. gent., who, it was understood, had just retired from the office of president of the Board of Controul, he wished to know from him, whether he had received official information from India on this point, or any information upon the correctness of which he could depend? Whether the house would give him credit or not, he would assure them that this transaction was one of the most dangerous kind with regard to its consequences, and he begged of the house not to shut their eyes to it, because the danger was distant in point of local situation. But this was not all; he believed that other advices had been received Within a few days past, of greater consequence than the information relative to the affair at Vellore. He alluded to the situation of the Carnatic, which had filled the government of Madras with the utmost alarm. So great, indeed, was this alarm, that an application had been made by the Madras government to general Maitland, governor of Ceylon, for an amount of force consisting of all the European troops in that settlement. He
<image src="S1V0009P0I0112"/>
<col>193</col>
had no official information of this; but he had heard it from what he considered as very good private authority. If, then, any information of this sort had come to the India House, he hoped the proper persons would consider it as their duty to lay it before the house. In the mean time he wished to know, whether, in point of fact, official or authentic information of this nature had been received. He assured the house that the information to which he referred went to the very existence of our power in India. He had long wished to give up all concern with the affairs of India, on account of the inadequate effects which he had found to result from his earnest and frequent appeals to the house on that subject. But this, however, was not solely an Indian subject, it was one materially connected with the prosperity and perhaps the existence of this country. In the Same Manner, whatever materially affected Ireland was not only an Irish but a British subject, as the interest of both were, in a great measure, identified.&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>spoke to order. He apprehended that it was irregular to go into a long statement when a member rose merely to ask a question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>agreed that it was irregular.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir P. Francis</member><membercontribution>had no other intention than merely to justify his asking those questions, and, as he had done this, he would trespass on the attention of the house no further.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney</member> <membercontribution>rose to give such answers as he could to the questions of his hon. friend. To the question, why no account relative to the finances of India had been laid before the house, the answer was that none could be laid, as they had not as yet arrived. One year's accounts might, indeed, have been made out, and it was his intention to have brought forward these, as might be recollected from the notice he had given. But when he found that he was immediately to have a Successor, and that, in fact, for some days past, he only held the office as a <i>locum tenens</i>, he thought that it would be more proper, under all the circumstances, not to take the affair out of the hands of others. He trusted it would not be thought that there was any neglect on his part. There were none arrived but the accounts to which he had adverted. and these he supposed were not those to which his hon. friend had referred in his question As to the question respecting the transaction at Vellore, the East India board was in possession of authentic documents relative to that point, which would enable them to form a complete judgment upon the 
<col>194</col>
whole affair. As to the third question, relative to the situation of the Carnatic, he could assure his hon. friend, that his private information was wrong. No application had been made for troops to general Maitland by the Madras government. There was one general, indeed, who finding himself in difficult circumstances had applied to the governor of Ceylon for some troops, but no regular advices on this subject had arrived from India. General Maitland, with that attention to his duty, and to the interests of his country, for which he was distinguished, had taken the first opportunity of sending the earliest notice of the state of India, but no regular advices had come from India itself. As to the affair at Vellore, if a motion was made for laying any information on that point before the house, the board of controul would, of course, judge how far it would be prudent to comply.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MOTION RESPECTING THE OFFICE OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER, &amp;C&#x2014;&#x2014;Mr. Henry Martin</member> <membercontribution>rose, pursuant to notice, to submit his motion to the house; and he had to regret that this task had not fallen into abler hands. He felt that he had little claim to the consideration of the house, and trusted that some gentleman of greater talents would come forward to support the question which he looked upon it as his duty to bring under the consideration of the house. But before he should enter into the grounds of his motion, or of the propriety of bringing it forward, he wished to clear away every suspicion that he was actuated by any motives of hostility towards the right hon. and learned gent. (Mr. Perceval) who was the object of it. With that gentleman he had the pleasure and the honour of being long acquainted, and he entertained the highest respect for his abilities and character. Much as he was attached to the honourable persons who composed his majesty's late administration, he could assure the house, that in bringing forward this motion, he was actuated by no party motive. He wished also to shew, that in doing this, he was not doing any thing that would trench upon the prerogative of the crown. From the year 1660 to the present time, there appeared but two instances in which the office of chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to which his motion particularly applied, had been granted for life. The result of the inquiry, which he had been able to make upon so short a notice was, that it had not in any other instance been granted for life within that period of 147 years. This would satisfy the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0113"/>
<col>195</col>
house that his motion for an address, that his majesty would be graciously pleased to grant this place according to the usual practice, would not interfere with his royal prerogative. The first instance in which it had been granted for life, was in 1717, when it had been granted to lord Lechmere who had for a long time filled the office of attorney general. He should establish the difference between the cases. In that instance, the person had been raised to the peerage when all the avenues to his profession were shut against him, and it was thought right to give him some provision for life in reward of his services. The next instance was in 1782, when the place of chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had been granted for life to lord Ashburton. He was anxious to state all that he had been able to find on the subject. Gentlemen must not suppose him ignorant of the cases that bore upon his motion. But under what circumstances had that noble lord received this office? He had filled the office of solicitor general; had been long at the head of his profession; and had distinguished himself in that house as much as the learned gent. opposite, but in a far different manner. He had distinguished himself in the support of the rights of the people, and of the authority of parliament, in which way he had never heard of the learned gent. having distinguished himself. That noble lord having got a peerage, when all the law offices were full, it had been thought right by the persons with whom he had acted in parliament, to give him the chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster for life. But it had not been granted to him to induce him to accept another office of honour and emolument. It was granted for services already performed. These were all the cases that he could find of such a grant; and, therefore, the motion for an address to his majesty, to make the grant in the usual manner, could not interfere with the prerogative; and there was a precedent of an address, the same in substance, though not in form, with that which he proposed to move. That address had been voted on the 23d of December 1783, on the occasion of a rumour that it was in his majesty's contemplation to grant this place for life, or for any other term than during pleasure, up to a particular period. He was aware of the difference between that resolution and the motion he intended to make, but at that time a report was expected from the committee of offices and acounts, which might recommend the aboii-
<col>196</col>
tion or modification of the office. He was not, however, so wedded to the words of his motion, as not to consent to modify it in any manner that the house might think proper. He did not know whether the committee at present inquiring into what offices ought to be abolished or regulated, might not be of the same opinion as Mr. Burke, that this office ought to be altogether abolished. But he did think that it would become a question in that committee, how far the grant of places for life was a grievance. For his part he looked upon such grants as equally grievances with the grants in reversion, and was of opinion, that no person should grant places except during his own life, unless for distinguished services. In such cases, he would admit the propriety of grants for life, as a remuneration for the services performed. But the hon. and learned gent. was to have another situation, which was in itself a place of great honour and emolument, and therefore could have no claim to the grant for life of such an office as that of the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster. Were the gentlemen who were to become his majesty's ministers to be tempted by such means to accept offices, which were generally objects of honourable ambition? He did not mean to confine his motion to the particular case, but rested it upon general principles, to extend to all such offices pending the existence of that committee, from whose labours he was convinced the house and the public service would derive so much benefit. His motion would not, at all events, be liable to the objection made to a resolution moved the preceding day by the chairman of the committee, and recommended by the committee, that it was an innovation, because in the course Of 147 years, there appeared but two instances in which the place had been granted for life. An address had also been voted of a similar nature on a former occasion, with which his majesty had complied, and had been graciously pleased to reply that he would not grant the office for life, and he had never since so granted it. It might be said, that he had taken the house by surprize. It ill became him to speak of himself, but every man who knew him, must know that he was incapable of taking the house by surprise. The motion had arisen out Of the discussion the preceding day, and the delay of a few hours might have rendered it nugatory. It might also be asked, why he had not brought forward the motion under the late administration? To this he should answer, that they
<image src="S1V0009P0I0114"/>
<col>197</col>
were incapable of any such proceeding, because they had shewn no disposition to grasp at every thing they could secure, because they had shewn the disinterested principles upon which they acted, by abstaining from granting any places in reversion. The hon. and learned gent. concluded by moving, "That an humble address be presented to his majesty, that he would be graciously pleased not to grant the office of chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, or any other office not usually granted for life, for any other term than during pleasure."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Hon. J. W. Ward</member> <membercontribution>rose to second the motion, to which he gave his full and cordial approbation. The motion for the address to his majesty was recommended to the house by every principle of reason, and all the authority of precedent. The precedents shewed incontestibly that the motion would not interfere with the royal prerogative, and the reason of the thing was so obvious, as not to require illustration. Every grant of a place for life had a direct tendency to impair the dignity of the crown. Any other measure might be condemned upon certain particular grounds, but this was a proceeding which was to be resisted upon every consideration of reason, policy, and interest. The practice, if permitted, would impair the dignity and means of the crown. It would abridge the exercise of the power of punishing weak, wicked, or corrupt ministers, by depriving them of their offices, and take away from the crown the power of bestowing those offices on wise and virtuous ministers; it would remove all <i>locus penitenti&#x0153;</i> from the sovereign, by tying up his hands with respect to offices which he might once have conferred on unworthy objects, and be an injury to the rights and interests of the people. Unavailing would be the complaint of the people under their sufferings; it would not be in the power of the crown to revoke such grants, after they had been once made. Grants of this description appeared to him unconstitutional under all circumstances. They had the effect, of raising up a race of men to live upon the wealth of the public, and to make them alike independent of the sovereign, who might promote them, and of the people, by whom the means were supplied for their support. As the grant of places for life therefore had such a direct tendency to deprive the crown of the power of punishing weak or wicked, and of rewarding its meritorious servants, the motion for the address should have his warmest support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member>,<membercontribution>had felt so anxious to be 
<col>198</col>
present at the discussion of this question, that he had delayed accepting the office which, but for the notice given by the honourable gentleman the preceding night, he should, ere this, have held. He thought it his duty by his presence to take care that if the house thought fit to address his majesty, it should be on accurate statements, and that no uncertain rumours should usurp the place of facts. He could not for a moment suppose, whatever might be the motives of his hon. and learned friend, that the present motion proceeded from any personal ill-will towards himself, because, in the whole of his intercourse with his learned friend, he was not conscious of a single circumstance from, which such ill-will could arise. It was unquestionably true, that he had received an offer from his majesty of the chancellorship of the exchequer, accompanied with a grant of the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster for life; and that, but for his learned friend's notice, he should at that moment have been in possession of both those situations; his learned friend, therefore, was not chargeable with surprise in bringing forward his motion at so short a notice, as otherwise the season of it would have gone by. He was not in the house the preceding evening; but understanding that such a notice had been given, instead of approaching his sovereign for the purpose of receiving his appointment to office, he had approached him with a request that the appointment might not take place on that day, that he might have an opportunity of addressing the house on the subject; and still more, that his majesty might not be fettered, in consequence of any advice that the house might think proper to offer him. This request was accompanied with an assurance, as his majesty had been pleased to think that he could be an useful servant, that, whatever might be the pleasure of his majesty in consequence of any address from the house of commons, although it should deprive him of the duchy of Lancaster, formerly offered, it would not in the slightest degree abate his wish to serve his majesty. Unquestionably, though in the first instance lie should not have felt justified in neglecting his duty to his family by quitting a lucrative profession without the prospect of something like compensation, yet when he found his majesty thought his services might be advantageous to the interest of the country, and when he saw the crisis in which that country was placed, he felt it no longer to be a matter of option with him, but that whatever might be the consequences
<image src="S1V0009P0I0115"/>
<col>199</col>
to himself, his sovereign should command the utmost exertion of his humble abilities. With respect to the two precedents alluded to by his learned friend, he would not compare himself with the object of either, but that lord Ashburton should be allowed, without notice, to accept for life the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster, impressed on him the belief that no parliamentary objection existed against such an appointment. Lord Ashburton was taken out of the profession of the law by an administration professedly of pure Whig principles, that of lord Rockingham; and the grant to him of the duchy of Lancaster was afterwards confirmed to him under the administration of a near relative of the noble lord opposite (the marquis of Lansdowne). Lord Ashburton was a man with whom it would Certainly be presumptuous for him to compare himself, but his majesty might think proper at different times to reward services done to different branches of the constitution. The most distinguished service of that learned lord was the famous resolution proposed by him in the house of commons, "that the influence of the crown had increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished." Such a person having received that appointment, under such an administration, had led him to think that the present motion would not have been seconded or supported by the representatives of the Whig principles in that house, and that it would not have received the countenance of an administration whose first act had been, not merely to advise the king to any due exercise of his prerogative, but to introduce into parliament a measure, by which a noble lord was enabled to hold two situations constitutionally incompatible with each other. The arguments of the hon. gentlemen opposite were applicable against every grant of an office for life, as well as his own; they were applicable to that exception from the practice so loudly boasted by the late administration, of withholding reversionary grants, in which the chancellor, to reward the private meritorious services of an individual, had procured for him the reversion for life of a lucrative situation. Surely, if the clerk of a barrister was not an improper person on whom to confer such a grant, it seemed extraordinary that he (Mr. Perceval) should be considered so. Although he acquitted his learned friend of any improper intentions, he should leave it to the house to consider, whether this motion arose from any large and general view of the subject, or whether
<col>200</col>
it was not directed solely against him; he did not mean to say personally, but from his being supposed to have facilitated the arrangements for a new administration. It would therefore be a serious subject for the consideration of the house, whether in present state and crisis of the country, and when all the circumstances connected with the new arrangement were before them, when they recollected that the object of forming a new administration was to preserve the establishments of the country, and perhaps the religion of it, whether they would be disposed to throw any difficulties in the way of his majesty in forming a new administration, when he conceived that in so doing he was only labouring to preserve the constitution of the country. Having said thus much, he thought that he ought to leave the subject to the discretion and judgment of the house, and that as it particularly related to himself he should withdraw, after having put the house in possession of his sentiments; but before he withdrew, he should repeat, that whatever might be their determination on the subject of the duchy of Lancater, and whatever sacrifices he might be called upon to make, no services that he could be called upon to render to his majesty should in the present situation of affairs be withheld.&#x2014;Mr. Perceval then made his bow, and left the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plumer </member> <membercontribution>rose merely to vindicate himself from the charge that, was yesterday brought against him, of making a statement in that house on the mere authority of an idle rumour. It appeared now, from what had fallen from the right hon. and learned gent. that his statement had been perfectly correct, and that if it had not been for the notice taken of it last night in the house, the business would have gone too far to remedy it, and the right hon. gent. would have now been in the possession of the two, places. He did not pretend to deny the merit of the right hon. gent., or mean any thing personal against him, but he had a great objection to the principle of giving a great place for life, merely as an inducement to a person to accept of an office in the service of the country, the emoluments of which had hitherto been considered a sufficient compensation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member> <membercontribution>said, that if he had not been so personally alluded to by the right hon. and learned gent. he did not think he should have troubled the house with any observations upon the present question. He was ready to join perfectly with the hon.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0116"/>
<col>201</col>
gent. who had brought forward this motion, in disclaiming any thing like personal hostility or personal reflection upon the right hon. and learned gent. who was the most immediately interested in the present motion; and he had no hesitation in stating, that if the salary annexed to the situation of chancellor of the exchequer was not sufficient (and he believed it was not), he should have no objection to granting such an augmentation to it, as would afford a reasonable and proper compensation for the services which might be expected from the right hon. gent. But although he certainly did object to a place for life being given to that gentleman, in order to induce him to accept the situation; yet as he had not before said a word upon the subject, he did not know how the right hon. gent. had discovered that he so warmly supported the motion. He thought it was also somewhat strange that he should be charged with acting inconsistently, or in a manner disrespectful to the memory of his near relation, (the marquis of Lansdown) if he was not to be bound completely by those precedents of the year 1762, or 1783. He thought there was a great difference between the cases cited and the present; but if there was not, he should not think it quite fair to charge him with inconsistency, if he should hold a different opinion. That relation, so near and dear to him, (the marquis of Lansdown, his father) had abundant claims upon his love and respect, without adverting to the case of lord Ashburton. But, however sincerely he was bound to respect his opinions and his memory, there were no ties of relationship, or private affection and respect, which could prevent him in that house from expressing his own opinion on any subject that came before them for discussion. The case of lord Lechmere he conceived to be quite distinct and separate from the present: as to the case of lord Ashburton, it must be recollected that the place of the duchy of Lancaster was not given him as an inducement to take another place, but as a means of supporting the dignity of the peerage to which he had been raised, not only on account of his great merits, but for the service and assistance he could render as a law lord. Lord Ashburton was then looked up to by every body as the fittest successor to lord Mansfield as Chief Justice of the King's Bench, which was the highest object of legal ambition. His majesty had been advised to confer the peerage upon him, and that he should not want suitable means of supporting its dignity
<col>202</col>
until the Chief Justiceship should be vacant, this place was conferred upon him. This was a case, which, he conceived, was, totally different from the present. If the salary of the chancellor of the exchequer were not sufficient, it might be recollected, that there Were a great number of other offices which might be given as a reward for services, when those services should have been actually performed; but he objected to the giving away the means of rewarding great services, merely to induce persons to become members of an administration. He considered that it was a most serious and unconstitutional attack on the most important prerogatives of the crown, to deprive it of all power and means of rewarding great public services, by taking the best places and gifts that it was in the power of the crown to bestow, before any of those services had been performed. He thought that the crown ought not to have been advised to limit its powers and prerogatives in this manner. Upon the subject of the alienation of crown lands, it had been always observed, that in whatever proportion the crown gave away to individuals its possessions and its right, in that proportion it became weaker, and it was the same with respect to lucrative offices. If they were all given away directly or in reversion to one set of Ministers, the crown left itself without that patronage and power of rewarding great Services, which it ought to possess. A recent and very remarkable case had occurred Some years ago in corroboration of this opinion. On an arrangement that Was then proposed, this very place was offered to lord Sidmouth, who had rendered considerable service during his long and meritorious discharge of his duties as Speaker. Lord Sidmouth declined it, and said he could not bring himself to be the instrument of alienating from the crown the means of rewarding greater public services than he had as yet been able to perform. It was not as a testimony in favour of lord Sidmouth that he mentioned this, for the noble lord required no such testimony of his disinterested conduct; but he mentioned it merely for the information of those members who were not previously acquainted with the circumstance. The principle upon which lord Sidmouth refused it applied with much greater strength to the present case; besides, it was known, that there was a committee of the house now constituted, for the express purpose of considering what useless and sinecure offices might be abolished; and as it was possible that the com
<image src="S1V0009P0I0117"/>
<col>203</col>
mittee might consider this to be among the number, he thought that it should not be thus disposed of, in a manner contrary to all usage, before the opinion of the committee was pronounced upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member> <membercontribution>could not help expressing his surprise at the manner in which this motion was supported, and his astonishment at the hon. and learned quarter whence it originated. When he recollected that the hon. and learned gent. who brought forward the motion was acquainted with the talents, integrity, and disinterestedness of his right hon. friend&#x2014;(Here there was a continued cry of hear! hear! mixed with laughter)&#x2014;A more honourable, a more liberal, a more independent, and a more disinterested character never existed&#x2014;(hear! hear!)&#x2014;He would go farther, and say, that if his right hon. and learned friend accepted of both places, he would make a large sacrifice by abandoning his professional pursuits in return. He should like to know, then, whence arose the surprise of hon. gentlemen opposite, when the word disinterestedness was mentioned? It could be from personal motives only. He was surprised that the noble lord who had lately left his majesty's councils, should throw any embarrassment in the way of the new administration, when that embarrassment tended to impede the usual exercise of the prerogative of the crown. The value of the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster did not exceed 2000<i>l</i>. per annum; and was this too large an equivalent for the fruits of his right hon. friend's professional exertions? He further contended, that the grant of the place in question for life was an usual grant (hear! hear! from the opposition). Well, if it was not an usual grant, he was at least warranted in saying, that it was not an unprecedented one. He maintained that there was no difference between the present case and that of lord Ashburton, although it had been attempted to set up some kind of distinction. There had much been said during a late debate, as to the economy of the late administration with respect to the grant of reversions; he had since inquired into it, and had found, that three reversions only fell within the power of the late administration, and that of those three they had already granted two [here several members of the late administration distinctly said, "state them, state them."] Perhaps, upon recollection, he was not quite warranted in the conclusion he had drawn; one of the two he had alluded to was, he believed, upon

consideration, not the grant of a reversion. He had also understood from the noble lord (H. Petty) that lord Ashburton was to keep the place in question for life, besides that of Chief Justice of the Court of the King's Bench (a general cry of no! no!); perhaps he was mistaken, he might have misunderstood the noble lord; but if he did not misunderstand him in another point, he could not abstain from expressing his surprise as to that point. The noble lord had talked of the committee of finance, as entitled to inquire into the state and utility of the office now in question. The noble lord ought to have known, that that office belonged to his majesty's privy purse, and therefore could not possibly come under the cognizance of that committee. Before he sat down he could not help expressing his surprize, that the noble lord (Howick) had fixed upon to-morrow for a certain important explanation, when that noble lord must have been aware, that the leading persons most interested in the discussion, and who had their story to tell, must by that time have vacated their seats by accepting the new appointments.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sharpe</member> <membercontribution>said, that if he were to judge from the specimen just given to the house, he should not expect that the new administration would be good at making convincing speeches. He could not help seriously expressing his surprise at the assertion of the hon gent. who spoke last, that there was no difference between the present case and that of lord Ashburton. It was painful to him to enter into any personal comparison, bat he hoped the house would acquit him of any invidious motive. Mr. Dunning was indisputably at the head of his profession. He was shut out from the great emoluments of such a situation, by being advanced to the upper house. As to the right hon. gent. in question; the least he could say, was that that right hon. gent. certainly was not at the head of his profession. He (Mr. Sharpe) had repeatedly in the course of not a very short life, discharged the duties of a juror, and yet it had been his great misfortune never once to have had his understanding enlightened by the professional exertions of the right hon. gent. He would go farther, for the truth was, that the abilities of the right hon. gent. were not known until he had got into an official situation. It might be asked, why did he enter into this unpleasant comparison? because it was of importance to that house and to the country, to know what was the real extent of the pro

<col>205</col>
fessional sacrifices made by the right hon. gent. He had the honour to be a member of the finance committee above stairs so often alluded to; and when he saw that one of the first steps of the new administration was to grasp at so considerable a sinecure at the same time that he saw them so far descent as to endeavour to justify themselves by recrimination, it would make him more cautious, and encourage him to prosecute his labours with greater diligence, in order that the report might be made before that premature extinction which he foresaw was intended for the present parliament. The hon. gent. concluded with expressing his intire concurrence in the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Montague rose</member>, <membercontribution>to contradict, substantially and directly, the statement made by the hon. gentleman who had just sat down, as far as that statement related to the professional eminence of his right hon. friend. The hon. mover knew well that eminence; and he contended that his right hon. friend must lose considerably by his present appointment, that is, he would give up more than he would receive. He contended, upon the word of a gentleman, that such was the fact. His right hon. friend had made even a greater sacrifice; he had given up the post of attorney general, to which he had an undisputed claim. Was he to receive no equivalent for the loss of eight or ten thousand pounds a year? Gentlemen might laugh, but he was anxious to convince fair men only; he was anxious that his arguments should weigh with fair men only, and he was free to say that gentlemen on the opposite side were not fair, nor disposed to be so (a general cry of order! order!)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>spoke to order. It was extremely irregular to impute unfairness to any member.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Montague</member>, <membercontribution>in continuation, said, that he was willing to make every apology; he begged pardon of the house for any temporary inadvertence; he could assure them that it was not intentional. He begged of the house to consider the case of his right hon. friend, obliged to turn his back on his profession, with a numerous family and absolute distress before him, if he was not to be recompensed: besides that, it would be peculiarly distressing, as affecting the arrangements making by his majesty, arrangements rendered necessary by the dereliction of those very men (here several gentlemen rose to order!)</membercontribution></p>
<p>The <i>Speaker</i> said, that as the house had already admitted statements not immediately 
<col>206</col>
connected with the question now before it, it was hard for him, during the remainder of the debate, precisely to determine the exact limits of order. The house had suffered the debate to take a turn, which it was not for him to change; as to any expressions of a disorderly nature, he should be prepared to detect and resist them.</p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>did not think the hon gent. when he was interrupted actually out of order, but he much feared, that the hon. member, had he not been then interrupted, was hurrying into that which would have called for serious animadversion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Montague</member>,<membercontribution>in continuation, said, that if a member did not intend to be disorderly, whatever expressions might have fallen from him, that member was not to be put down by clamour. He addressed himself to the independent members of that house, and to their attention did he particularly address himself (another cry of order, order! chair, chair!).</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>wished the honourable member to recollect, that in the language of that house no such distinction between its members was recognised.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Montague</member>, <membercontribution>in continuation, again apologised, stating, that the distinction he meant was between those seeking for places and pensions, and those who were not candidates for either. He himself was one of the latter, for he never had nor never would solicit a place, though he had been so long in habits of the strictest intimacy with a great and leading statesman. He should conclude with stating, that had it not been for the unseasonable interruptions he had met with, he should not have been upon his legs so long.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Henry Thornton</member> <membercontribution>said he could not give his vote on this occasion without requesting to be indulged in a few words to qualify it. No man entertained a higher opinion of the right honourable gentleman, who was the subject of the present debate, than he did; and therefore, in supporting the present question, he wished to be considered more as giving a declaratory vote upon general principles, than as intending any opposition to the arrangement made; he voted merely upon a dry abstract principle, and not at all from party motives. It was his opinion that places usually held under the crown during pleasure ought not to be granted for life. Whether, as a member of the Committee of Finance, and having breathed so long the air of that committee, he came down to the house now to give his vote with
<image src="S1V0009P0I0119"/>
<col>207</col>
greater strictness than usual, he would not pretend to determine; but his vote was certainly the result of his conviction upon the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>said, he should not have risen to trouble the house, but for the purpose of making an observation, in answer to some allusions made to him by an honourable member who spoke early in the debate (Mr. Plumer), in respect to what he had said last night. The honourable member, it was true, had last night stated, what turned out to be founded in fact, as proved by the declaration of a right honourable gentleman this evening (Mr. Perceval), but When he did state the circumstance, he avowed no other ground than rumour, unsupported by any authentic reference. Adverting to the comparisons which had been made by gentlemen on the other side of the house, between the case now under consideration, and those of lord Ashburton and lord Lechmere, he thought there was very little difference. But he could not refrain from some observations upon the conduct of those honourable gentlemen themselves, when they were taking credit for so much purity and disinterestedness. He would ask, how they could reconcile with those assumptions, the indecency of pressing upon that house on their first accession to office, and at nine o'clock at night, two successive stages of a bill for enabling the noble lord at the head of the late administration (lord Grenville) to hold as a sinecure the office of Auditor of the Exchequer, with large emoluments annexed, and the duties of which were to be done by another; and this at the same time that another noble lord at the head of the family enjoyed the Tellership of the Exchequer with emoluments almost incalculable? How could they reconcile with this boasted purity the extraordinary increase made in the salary of First Lord of the Admiralty, lately enjoyed by another branch of that noble family, and this not avowed to parliament in an open manly way, but effected by a secret fund? How could that right honourable gentleman reconcile to his purity the calling on the house for 3000<i>l</i>. for the expences of further continuing the commission of naval enquiry, and not say a word about his own salary? With respect to the Committee of Finance, for which those honourable gentlemen took so much credit to themselves, so far from their having the merit to originate the measure, it was rather forced upon them by the patriotism of his honourable friend op
<col>208</col>
posite to him (Mr. Biddulph); but when the late ministers found the measure was too popular to be resisted, the noble lord (Petty) adopted it, and claimed that as his own, which he had no right to arrogate. The honourable gentlemen boasted much of their economical arrangements; but what had they done for the country in effect? They had indeed appointed commissioners of accounts without number; but what had these effected? The West India Commissioners, who had been so long appointed, at large salaries, had not even yet sailed upon their mission; and as to the army accounts, nothing appeared to have been effected there. Such had been the conduct of these patrons of reform! In short, he apprehended that whenever those honourable gentlemen should come to state what they really had done, their explanation would be something like what occurred between general Stanhope and general Walpole upon a former occasion, namely, nothing better than mutual reproach and Mutual recrimination. Those men were the fathers of the house of commons at that day, and the house, in pity to their nakedness, turned their backs upon them, and so he hoped they would do upon these honourable gentlemen.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that it was not the first time he had observed in the honourable gentleman who had just sat down an eagerness to attack the late administration and its friends, though certainly the present, like every former attempt, evinced rather an avidity to attack than a power to be offensive, He was glad, however, to see in the present attack something like a philosophical neutrality, and that as the late administration had had the misfortune of the honourable gentleman's opposition, so the present would be now likely to come in for its due share. The honourable gentleman had said a great deal about independence, and had congratulated himself in an angry tone upon his having no place under any government. He (Mr. Sheridan) could only say, that he was no divulger of private secrets; but he might make some allusion to a certain public message, which he had been deputed to deliver to a right honourable friend, now no more (Mr. Fox) at the formation of the late administration. He was sure the honourable gentleman perfectly understood him (a general laugh). He was rather inclined to believe, from the nature of that message, that the honourable gentleman, notwithstanding his present acrimony, might then have been completely dulcified
<image src="S1V0009P0I0120"/>
<col>209</col>
towards that terrible administration he had been so much of late in the habit of condemning; aye, and disinterestedly condemning too; or disinterestedly, if such pronunciation better suited the taste of the honourable gentleman, whether classical or vulgar. It was unnecessary to explain more. He believed the honourable gentleman perfectly understood him.&#x2014;The honourable gentleman had arraigned the late ministry for having abandoned their public professions. Having made such a charge, the onus of the proof lay with the honourable gentleman; and he (Mr. Sheridan) defied him to produce any instance in which the late ministers had for a moment shrunk from the principles which they had professed, not merely on their coming into power, but during the continuance of that power. They were denied the credit of the committee of finance. Did they not support it, and encourage it to the utmost of their power? What had been the principle of that committee? Economy; and what had been the avowed principle of the late ministers? Economy. Was he called on for an instance? He would instance the reduction of the staff; he would instance the barrack department; he would instance the reduction of the department of the commissariat. He would ask the honourable gentleman, if his noble friend near him (lord H. Petty) did not pledge himself at the outset of his administration, to the adoption of every practicable plan of reform and retrenchment in the public expenditure, and if he had not followed up that pledge to the last moment of his official authority? the honourable gentleman wished to deprive his noble friend of all claim to the merit of originating the committee of finance, and to attribute the whole to another honourable gentleman (Mr. Biddulph) from whose merit it was by no means his wish to detract; but he would say, that his noble friend, in adopting that, measure with a view of giving it greater extension, by no means wished to deprive the honourable gentleman, who first proposed it, of the credit of originality; but surely his noble friend was entitled to the praise of having promptly adopted the suggestion for the advantage of the public, indifferent from whom it might proceed. Would that honourable gentleman, who was himself a member of that committee. [Here lord Henry Petty suggested to Mr. Sheridan, that the honourable member (Mr. Johnstone) was not a member of that committee; Mr. Sheridan answered loudly, "I am very glad of it,"
<col>210</col>
which occasioned a considerable laugh]. He would ask, then, of that honourable gentleman who was not a member of the committee, and might be therefore more impartial, whether the late ministers were not upon this ground particularly entitled to the acknowledgments of the country? Did it appear that there had been any shuffling, or any ministerial balloting in the formation of that committee; was there any obtrusion of minister's friends? He appealed to the chairman himself of that committee, to the honourable gentleman (Mr. Biddulph) with whom the motion that led to the creation of that committee had originated, if such practices had been resorted to. An allusion had been made to the increase of salary in the office of first lord of the admiralty. The salary was confessed to be shamefully low. A noble lord (Melville) whose conduct since had been the subject of such general animadversion, on the same appointment, received, in addition, a considerable salary, levied by the illegal interception of the revenue of Scotland, which salary the noble lord still held though deprived of his place, in virtue of which he originally held it. If, therefore, the charges brought by the honourable gentleman were not to be better founded than those he had already adduced, he (Mr. Sheridan) wished that the honourable gentleman would secure to himself the office of charger general against the late administration and all their friends.&#x2014;He desired now to pay some attention to the speech of another hon. gentleman (Mr. Montague) who had been pleased to charge gentlemen on his side of the house with deriding his arguments, because they could not answer them; the hon. gentleman might, however, have had the politeness to wait a little, and try whether they were able to answer him or not, before he made the assertion. The hon. member had saved them the necessity, by offering them no arguments to answer: and as to every thing else, he had so fully answered himself throughout his speech, that it would be superfluous to answer him any farther. Some comparisons had been made between the case now under discussion, and those of lord Ashburton and lord Lechmere; and some comparisons had also been drawn between the characters and merits of those noble lords, and the right hon. gentleman now the subject of the debate. It was not his province to go into a scrntiny upon merits, and no man more highly esteemed
<image src="S1V0009P0I0121"/>
<col>211</col>
than he did the parliamentary talents of the right hon. gentleman; and therefore he thought the advice to his majesty, Of placing hint on the opposite bench, was wisely given. He could not enter into a comparison of the number of briefs, fees, and motions which fell to the professional lot of the right hon. gentleman, and which he was to abandon for his new office. But he (Mr. Sheridan), whose lot it was to Vindicate his majesty's new ministers from the indiscreet zeal of some of their friends, must beg to observe, that they must be strange friends indeed who could advise the right hon. gentleman to give up his certain professional emoluments of 8 or 10,000<i>l</i>. a year, as alledged, to accept a place of 2,000<i>l</i>. in the experiment to become a tolerable chancellor of the exchequer. It was a sacrifice which the house did not wish the right hon. gentleman to make, but rather that he would keep both his emoluments and his profession; and to those who gave him a contrary counsel, well might he exclaim, "Oh, save me from my friends, I can myself take care of my enemies!" with respect to the comparison made between the right hon. gentleman and lord Ashburton, the cases were totally different. That gentleman, when Mr. Dunning, was at the top of a profession, of which he was the ornament, when he was called up to the house of peers without a place; and if the duchy of Lancaster had not been assigned him, he must have had for his support a pension from the public purse. He, however, accepted the situation for life, on the condition of relinquishing it, so soon as the great object of his professional views was open, namely, the Chief Justiceship of the King's Bench; but, notwithstanding the sneers which had been cast this night upon that noble lord, in allusion to his parliamentary conduct, in bringing forward a resolution, "that the influence of the crown had "increased, was increasing, and ought to "be diminished," he thought the circumstance highly honourable to his character, and such as ought not to deprive him of the favour of his sovereign, for only wishing to curb that increasing influence of the ministers of the crown, which added nothing to the comforts, the honour, or the authority of the monarch. And he thought the crown more faithfully and honourably served by the men, such as him, who brought forward this resolution, and that they were more truly the supporters of the constitutional prerogatives of the sovereign, than the men who could advise the measure now in
<col>212</col>
debate. It was extremely painful to him to make any comparisons that might be thought to wear an invidious aspect to the right. hon. gentleman, but he recollected that ever since he was a member of that house he was mostly in office. He had been Attorney General under Mr. Pitt, and Solicitor General under lord Sidmouth; and here he begged leave to pay his tribute of praise to the upright, pure, and honourable conduct of that noble lord, as it had been explained this night, when under the administration of Mr. Pitt, he might have had the place for life, which it was now in contemplation to confer upon the new chancellor of the exchequer, had his honourable scruples permitted him to become the instrument of limitation to the prerogative and constitutional influence of his royal master. During the short period of the learned gentleman's opposition, the air of this side of the house did not seem to agree with him, and he was now got back to the balmy and blissful atmosphere of the Treasury Bench.&#x2014;The honourable member had asked, will you deprive his majesty of the learned gentleman's services in that office for which he had been thought qualified? Now really he was of opinion, that if gentlemen on the opposite side possessed any thing at all, they were swarming with chancellors of the exchequer, (a laugh.) Even a noble lord and a gallant general had lately proposed their plans of finance to the house; why not make either of them chancellors of the exchequer? Why not make the gallant general attorney-general? (a laugh.)&#x2014;Among all their financiers, not one could be found to fill the office, but a gentleman who, though a very frequent speaker in the house, had never, to his knowledge, uttered one word on the subject of finance in his life.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Johnstone</member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, stated that he neither had nor would have applied to the right honourable gentleman who had just sat down for the purpose of procuring him any appointment upon the occasion alluded to, and for two reasons, the first, that he knew, if he had applied, the right honourable gentleman was too much engaged in providing for himself and his family, to attend to any agency for others; and secondly, because if he had requested the right honourable gentleman to undertake the commission, he was pretty sure that, although he might promise, he would have been very apt to forget it. Now the fact was, upon the case referred to by the right honourable gentleman, simply no more than this. After stating to the right honourable gentleman the substance
<image src="S1V0009P0I0122"/>
<col>213</col>
of some conversati&#x00F2;ns which he had with an illustrious person, now no more, (Mr. Fox) he did communicate to that right honourable gentleman, and authorize him to mention his readiness to accept of any office to which no salary should be attached, and in which he might be able to make himself useful. He remembered that he particularly mentioned Indian affairs, from his knowledge of which he stated to the right honourable gentleman his opinion that he should be able to render some service to his country. In offering to accept a situation in the conduct of those affairs without any emolument for his services, he hoped he was making
proposition which should not expose him to censure, or to the suspicion of any unworthy motives.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, expressed an unwillingness to fix any imputation on the honourable gentleman. As some persons wished for emoluments, so others wished for honour or patronage. It was not for him to say, of what description the honourable gentleman's ambition was. With respect to the charge of his (Mr. Sheridan) being busy in providing for himself and his family, the fact was, that his right hon. friend, who was now unhappily no more(Mr. Fox), thought, that after a service, he hoped not unmeritorious, of twenty-seven years in parliament, some provision for life ought to be made for him. It had happened rather singularly, that his right honourable friend had intimated, that the office that had been so much spoken of that night, the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster, should be appropriated to that provision; but, on consulting with his colleagues, his right honourable friend found that trey had formed a determination not to grant for life this office, or any other, usually held during pleasure. On being informed of this determination, he entreated his right honourable friend by no means to press the matter, and thus he remained without a provision for life, and this office was reserved for the disposal of the new ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>thought the right of granting the office in question for life ought not to be much exercised. He thought it wrong, however, to adopt a general restriction with a view to a particular case. He regretted that the question should now be brought forward to prevent the formation of a new administration. He wished the late administration to have remained in place. But the new administration were better than none, and therefore he was unwilling to see its formation impeded. If the crown had the power
<col>214</col>
of granting the office for life to lord Lechmere and lord Ashburton, it had also the power of granting it in the present case, and who had a right to interfere with the discretion of the crown in the exercise of that power?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>said, he should be always forward to support the just exercise of his majesty's prerogative; but he confessed that he must disapprove of the manner in which it was understood that this prerogative was now about to be applied, and therefore he would support this motion. For the sake of the king's own interest he would support this motion; because he did not like the idea of his majesty's giving away places for life. On the contrary, he would advise him to keep such places subject to his disposal, for those men who served him. He would recommend to the king to keep the key of the oat-chest himself, and not give it to others; for he might rely upon it, that if he did not retain the power of serving those men, they would not serve him. It would be much better for his majesty that all places for life were converted into places during pleasure than to allow any increase of the former. This he said with a view to the king's own interest; for he regarded his majesty much, for his firm attachment to the constitution. He declared, that in his opinion the names of George the Third, Nelson, and William Pitt, ought to be engraven on the hearts of all Englishmen, for the noble services they had rendered to their country; for having in fact been the saviours of our glorious constitution. As to the right honourable gentleman to whom this motion was understood particularly to refer, he declared that he could see no reasonable objection to him, compared with those who preceded him in the office to which he was said to be appointed, especially when he considered how young the man was who held that office in the late administration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>had the honour, he said, to have been very long acquainted with the principles and character of the right honourable gentleman to whom this motion was understood more immediately to refer, and he sincerely believed him a man of the highest disinterestedness and public spirit. With this impression strongly upon his mind, his opinion must be, that that right honourable gentleman himself would have come forward to render this debate unnecessary, if it were not that, from the manner in which a notice of the motion had been given, the remarks which had been made the preceding night, and other circumstances, such a proceeding might ap
<image src="S1V0009P0I0123"/>
<col>215</col>
pear the effect of intimidation, than which nothing, he was persuaded, was less likely to have effect upon the mind of that right honourable gentleman. However, the motion was such as he could not hesitate to support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Master of the Rolls</member> <membercontribution>having had no opportunity of inquiring fully into the merits of the general proposition which this motion involved, could not think himself justified in voting for its adoption. There were, in his opinion, a variety of topics, which ought to be fully investigated before such a motion was acceded to. There were many places held for life which ought to be converted into places during pleasure, and, <i>vice versa</i>, there were also many places, the tenure of which ought to be left entirely to the discretion of his majesty, and of which nature the place to which this motion was understood to refer might be one; the house surely would not venture to decide without any enquiry or deliberation whatever. If the case were determined in the very hasty manner proposed, he was rather afraid that the public would not give the house credit for acting dispassionately, in being actuated by the motives which the advocates professed to have in view; for it would be very naturally asked, if such motives prevailed, why should a question of this nature be brought forward in a hurry? When the honourable gentlemen who supported this motion reprobated the practice of granting for life such a place as it particularly alluded to, did they feel that they were reflecting on the conduct of the marquis of Rockingham and Mr. Fox, in 1782, and that it Was a corrupt act, so to grant the same place to lord Ashburton? But his main objection to this motion at present, the learned gentleman Stated to be this, that it took up a broad and general question upon mere personal grounds; and this he the more regretted, because his right honourable friend to whom it alluded, was certainly one who gave up, it was notorious, a very high and lucrative situation in his profession, for the purpose of serving his sovereign and his country in another department, by which act he certainly ought not to be allowed suffer any loss: but taking a view of the proposition under discussion, upon general grounds, he would appeal to the candour and good sense of the house, whether if a case of universally acknowledged merit should arise, to which a Place of this nature ought to be given for life; the house should so limit the prerogative as to prevent his majesty from granting it; whether if a case,
<col>216</col>
for instance, such as that of lord Ashburton should occur the day following, the house itself would not regret the imposition of such a restraint? He would therefore put it to the house, whether it would not be extremely rash to adopt a resolution of this nature, restraining the legitimate prerogative of the crown, without any inquiry or deliberation as to its tendency and probable consequences?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member>, <membercontribution>denied the right hon. and learned gentleman's assertion, that this motion went to impose any improper restraint upon the royal prerogative, or that it could in any degree be considered an innovation or invasion of that prerogative. For, in point of fact, what did it propose? Why, nothing more than this, that a place should not be granted for life, which had been heretofore held only during pleasure. He was not at present disposed to enter into a discussion as to the extent of the king's prerogative; but this he had no difficulty in saying, that this prerogative did not authorise the grant of places for life, which had been heretofore held during pleasure. This motion, therefore, only proposed to advise his majesty not to do that which according to law he was not warranted in doing. The conduct towards the judges in the reign of William the Third, had no reference whatever to the case now under consideration. If, indeed, the crown could grant places of this nature for life, why not by and by grant the chancellorship of the exchequer itself, or the lord chancellorship for life? A case of the latter having been so appointed had no, doubt occurred in the person of Wolsey. But, what were the remarks of lord Coke upon that subject? Why, that the principle of such an appointment was utterly objectionable, that it was not legal to grant those places for life which it had been heretofore usual to hold during pleasure. Such, then, was the object of this motion. It proposed only to declare the law to the crown, in order that no deviation from it should take place. With regard to the precedents referred to in the course of the debate, he had not had time to look into all the proceedings upon them; but in the case of lord Ashburton, he believed that the propriety of the grant made to that noble lord was at that time much disputed, and, in his opinion, very justly. For, much as he respected the merits of that great man, he certainly should not have voted for such a measure, as he could not think it was a legal grant. To the memory and character of the marquis of Rockingham, although he was too young to have had the happiness of any acquaintance with him, no one could
<image src="S1V0009P0I0124"/>
<col>217</col>
be more willing than he was to pay the utmost tribute of respect. Towards another distinguished member (lord Lansdowne) of that administration under which that grant took place, he felt both respect and gratitude, for to that noble lord he owed much personal kindness. But still he could not express any approbation of the grant they thought proper to sanction, either upon the grounds of constitutional principle or expediency. The right honourable and learned gentleman seemed to allude to some instances of persons being rewarded by pensions for quitting the lucrative profession of the law to engage in politics. He really never heard of any such instance. [the case of lord Grantley was mentioned across the table.] But, resumed the noble lord, that case does not apply; for that noble lord, who was Speaker of the house of commons, was placed in a situation where legal knowledge was essential to the performance of his duty, and that knowledge augmented his title to the liberality of provision. Lord Ashburton, too, filled an high office in the house of lords, and was a cabinet minister. In both the cases the noble lords alluded to were not taken out of their profession, properly speaking. But such was not the case with the right honourable gentleman referred to in the present debate. He did not mean to speak of that right honourable gentleman with any personal disrespect; but certainly he could not compare his pretensions with those of Mr. Dunning. No, they were not to be placed on the same footing, and therefore the analogy contended for could not hold. But, if the arrangement were to make the right honourable gentleman lord chancellor, he should have no objection, neither should he object to see him occupy any of the high legal offices in that house for which his abilities and habits so peculiarly fitted him; but when he saw him leaving his profession for the purpose of pursuing finance, he could not help feeling some surprise, and something more when it was proposed to give the right honourable gentleman a bonus for this singular transfer. Upon this point, however, he did not mean to say more, for indeed it was unnecessary after the admirable, speech of his right honourable friend (Mr. Sheridan), who very justly observed, that of all the other departments, that of chancellor of the exchequer was the one for which the right honourable gentleman seemed to be least qualified. If, however, the right honourable gentleman chose to pursue the career of politics in preference to the career of the law, he must take it with all its risks. It
<col>218</col>
had been, the noble lord observed, ascribed to the party with whom he had the honour to act, that they pretended to comprehend all the talents of the country. If they had ever imagined themselves to be so, it would have been a most arrogant presumption indeed; but they always disclaimed any such pretensions, although it suited the purpose of newspaper libellers to persist in repeating the charge; a charge, indeed, which he, for one, took occasion, as often as opportunity served, to repel. But, without arrogating any extraordinary degree of talents to those with whom he was connected; without attempting any contrast with their opponents, he would ask, what estimate was to be formed of the ability of those honourable gentlemen who felt obliged to go to the law for a chancellor of the exchequer, and to offer him a premium for accepting the office? On this head little remained to be added to what the house had heard from an honourable member (Mr. Sharp). who had afforded such an evidence of talent, in this his first essay, as held out the most flattering promise of future eminence.&#x2014;With regard to the assertion, that only one reversion had fallen in since the late administration came into power, he could assure the house, that this was a mistake, for there was a very considerable reversion which fell in in an island, and another indeed in an office over which he presided, which he did not think proper to dispose of. Now, surely the disposition made by the lord chancellor of a particular reversion in that noble lord's gift could not be cited as an instance to contradict the assertion he advanced on a former evening relative to the general conduct of the late ministers upon the subject of reversions. The fact of the reversion alluded to in the lord chancellor's gift was not classed by the report of the committee of finance in the list of public reversions, but was always considered as a private place, subject to the sole controul of the officer by whom it had in this instance been disposed of.&#x2014;Adverting to the observation of an honourable gentleman on the other side (Mr. Sturges Bourne) that he ought not to bring forward on the following day the explanation of which he had given notice, in the absence of those who were acquainted with and competent to answer him upon the subject of that explanation, the noble lord stated, that he was glad those gentlemen were absent; for, said he, it is one which I should hold it to be rather inde<ob/>icate to canvass. I shall confine m<ob/>self to a statement of the facts, which are so much misrepresented that I should feel it to be highly
<image src="S1V0009P0I0125"/>
<col>219</col>
improper to suffer such misrepresentations to be further circulated, and particularly so to leave such misrepresentations to operate during the holidays. To this resolution I am the more determined, and the necessity of an early explanation appears the more obvious, from a letter which was shewn me in a newspaper of this morning addressed to lord Grenville and myself. In this letter some extracts from the minutes of the council are inserted, which serve to shew that the writer had seen our minutes; but he has so garbled them as to give a false colour to the whole transaction. I will appeal then, to the candour of those who hear me whether I should allow such misrepresentation to go unanswered; whether by postponing the answer, I should suffer the misrepresentation to do mischief; whether it be not more becoming in me to state here, it the proper constitutional place, the real circumstances of the case; or, whether the honourable gentleman would have me condescend to answer the writer in a newspaper? I shall upon this explanation trust to the candour of the house, and to the justice of my country, for the vindication of that line of conduct, which in concert with my colleagues, I have felt it my duty to pursue.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, said, he had expressed some surprise that the noble lord should think of bringing forward his explanation in the absence of those who alone could know on that side of the house, the circumstances to which the noble lord would have to advert. The noble lord would not suppose, surely, that he had any thing to do with the publication alluded to by the noble lord. He assured him he knew nothing of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Graham</member> <membercontribution>supported the motion. He had for many years acted with Mr. Pitt, and generally of course with the gentlemen on the other side, particularly during the last parliament, when such proceedings had taken place against a noble viscount, to whom he had the honour to be related (lord Melville,) as were by their violence and injustice a disgrace to the Journals of the house. He regretted sincerely the dismissal of the late administration, and particularly as they were succeeded by men who from their conduct in abandoning the government on the death of Mr. Pitt, from acknowledged incapacity to conduct it, left that on record which furnished an evidence of their present presumption.&#x2014;The question being then loudly called for, a division took place: when there appeared for the address 208; against it 115; majority
<col>220</col>
93. While the supporters of the address were in the lobby, order was called, and lord Howick addressed them as follows:&#x2014;Gentlemen; I understand, that it is intended to propose to morrow, that the house should at its rising adjourn for a much longer time than is usual at this period of the session, or than I think consistent with the present state of affairs, or with my views of the public interest. The adjournment which is to be proposed is to next Monday fortnight. It is my intention, on the grounds I have mentioned, to oppose that motion, and to propose by way of amendment, unless, as I hope, it may be proposed by somebody else, that no longer adjournment should take place than till Monday se'nnight at farthest. As there will certainly be a division upon this question, and in all probability an early one, I hope Gentlemen will feel the propriety of a full and early attendance.&#x2014;(a loud cry of hear, hear.) On the re-admission of strangers, we found that the address had been ordered to be carried up by such members of that house who were of his Majesty's privy council.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MR. PALMER'S PETITION.]</member> <membercontribution>A petition of John Palmer Esq. of the city of Bath was brought up, and read; setting forth, "that the petitioner having, in common with other subjects of this kingdom experienced great inconvenience from the tedious, irregular, and insecure mode of correspondence by the General Post, and having had frequent occasions to remark great defects in the establishments of the Post Office, which had become a matter of universal complaint, he was induced to give much serious consideration to a grievance of such magnitude, and was ultimately convinced that improvements might be made so as not only to effect a more speedy, regular, and secure conveyance for letters throughout the Kingdom, but likewise be the means of providing the same advantages for property and travellers, and at the same time of creating and supporting a gradual, and ultimately a very considerable, increase to the revenue, derivable from the Post Office, which, instead of keeping pace with the increasing commerce and opulence of the country, had (in consequence of the defects before alluded to) been long in a state of stagnation, if not of actual decrease; and that in the spring of 1782, the petitioner having arranged the general outline of his proposed reform, and connected with it such an increased rate of postage, with a restriction on franking, as appeared adviseable at the commencement, he communicated the same to the right ho
<image src="S1V0009P0I0126"/>
<col>221</col>
hourable William Pitt, the then chancellor of his Majesty's exchequer, who immediately conceived so favourable an opinion of the benefit to be obtained for the country if the plan could be effected, that he gave the petitioner every encouragement to proceed, and requested him without delay to procure all possible information on a subject of so much importance, and to spare no pains in bringing the proposed arrangements into such a state as would enable and justify a trial of the scheme; and that, in consequence of these directions, the petitioner, after making some requisite arrangements in regard to the extensive commercial and other concerns in which he was at that time engaged, travelled over a great part of the kingdom, for the purpose of collecting further information on the subject, the different Postmasters having previously received orders from the treasury to answer his inquiries; and that, during the petitioner's absence, the administration was changed, but the new administration being equally desirous of encouraging and effecting the plan, sent the outline to the general post Office for inspection, and it was returned with voluminous objections from the superior officers, who asserted, that the post office establishment had, after the fullest consideration and every possible exertion, been brought to the most perfect state of improvement, not only as to expedition and safety, but in the interior departments, and that any attempt to alter it would be ruinous to the correspondence and commerce of the country, and if any ignorant projector were suffered to interfere for such a purpose, he ought to be made responsible, as far as might be, for the consequences; and that, although some of these objections appeared well founded, it was evident that others arose from prejudice and self-interest; but the petitioner was directed to answer them in detail, which he had scarcely done . before the administration was again changed; and Mr. Pitt, on his return to office, received further decided objections from the post office, which were followed up by such a determined opposition and outcry against the plan as to create a combination amongst the inn keepers and coach-masters on the roads, and by rendering them unwilling to convey the mails on the terms proposed threatened to destroy the whole of the arrangements made by the petitioner preparatory to the trial; this, together with the complicated nature and construction of the posts, which his plan would totally disarrange, and which he must of course completely new
<col>222</col>
model, gave full employment to his mind, and cause for serious reflection and anxiety; and that the petitioner had first taken up the idea of reform as a very simple one, and easy to be accomplished, but as he was imperceptibly led on in the pursuit of his favourite object, the new and accumulated dangers and obstacles which opened upon him at every step, together with the inveterate opposition he experienced from the General Post Office, from which he had been led to expect by government every assistance, convinced him that he had involved himself in almost inextricable difficulties; it had completely possessed his mind, and he had pursued it through different changes of administration for above two years; he had, incurred great expence; the various concerns he had been engaged in had been neglected to his great loss, and he found that he had no alternative now left, but either to abandon the plan, to return to safety, and dedicate his future life to the recovery and improvement of his various private concerns, or to make the sacrifice of abandoning those altogether, and adhere to his plan, and to the chance of acquiring a great fortune for himself and family by its success, as Mr. Allen had done before him by his improvements of the posts; he submitted therefore these circumstances and his situation to Mr.Pitt, and the necessity of immediately settling the terms which were to determine his choice, and that to the justice of this the minister directly assented, and assured the petitioner, that if he would give in his proposals for compensation so that the promised advantages could but be secured, and the agreement be made fair and safe for the public, whatever fortune the petitioner might derive from it, there would be no hesitation on his part to close with it, and to satisfy his mind as to his future prospects; and that, in consequence of this assurance, the petitioner informed Mr. Pitt, through the present Bishop of Lincoln, his then secretary, that he would undertake the proposed reform at his own risk and expence, on condition that he should be entitled to receive, during his life, two and an half per centum on the future increased revenue of the Post Office beyond the present nett profits, provided his plan succeeded, but not a shilling otherwise; and that with this proposal the petitioner delivered in a statement of the Post Office revenue, from a very early period, by which it appeared, that, at the expiration of two centuries from its establishment, it had reached only to &#x00A3;150,000 per annum; and, to mark more strongly the profits he expected to de
<image src="S1V0009P0I0127"/>
<col>223</col>
rive from his plan, as well as the powers necessary to carry it into execution, he likewise gave in a narrative of Mr. Allen's transactions and agreement with government in 1720, relative to his farm of the cross posts, which were improved gradually, and at different periods, during upwards of 42 years, till he died (after the accumulation of a very large fortune, and his having received upwards of &#x00A3;12,000 per annum for many years, as a reward for his services, and during the whole time retained the absolute and independent controul of that branch of the Post Office); and that, in reply to this offer, the petitioner was informed by Mr. Pitt, through his secretary, "that the proposal was thought fair, and would be fully complied with, provided the plan succeeded;" and that the agreement having been thus acceded to, the petitioner proceeded to make his plan more perfect, and prepare for the trial; and Mr. Pitt, in every conversation previous to such trial, constantly expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the fairness and moderation of the terms, and the benefit to be derived to the public if the plan could but be successfully carried into execution; and that in the autumn of 1784, after two years of incessant labour and aux<ob/>ety, the plan was tried on the Western road, and succeeded beyond the promise held out by the petitioner, who had nevertheless afterwards to encounter a renewal of hostilities and impediments from the Post Office, which obliged him to apply for the protection of the Lords of the Treasury, who immediately saw the necessity of their interference, and issued a peremptory order for the purpose; but the mischief had so far been done, that a considerable delay took place before the trials could be made upon the other roads; and that Mr. Pitt, being of opinion that the repeated impediments and opposition experienced from the Post Office rendered it absolutely requisite that the petitioner should hold some ostensible official situation, the better to enable him to forward the establishment of his plan, and prevent further obstructions, proposed that he should be appointed surveyor and comptroller general, with a salary of &#x00A3;1,500 per annum, which should be accepted in lieu of per centage on any part of the Post Office revenue within &#x00A3;240,000, being &#x00A3;90,000 above the amount at that time; and of course the proposed salary was considerably less than the per centage would have amounted to; but the petitioner consented to this proposed modification of his original agreement, ra-
<col>224</col>
ther than start obstacles on his part, and particularly as it was intimated that, in case any accident should happen to the petitioner after effecting the plan, but before he had an opportunity of making a suitable provision for his family, there could be no doubt but that government would take such an event into consideration; and that in the autumn of 1785, when the plan had been carried into effect on many of the roads in the kingdom, and arrangements made for its further extension, a draft of the petitioner's intended appointment was prepared at the Treasury, agreeably to the modified terms, being a grant from his majesty appointing the petitioner surveyor, and comptroller general of the Post Office during his life, with authority to suspend any of the officers and servants belonging thereto, and granting him in consideration of his good and faithful services for the advancement of the revenue, and the advantage of the commerce and manufactures of the kingdom, as well by way of reward of such services, as to encourage him to continue his exertions for furthering the same, a clear salary of &#x00A3;1,500, together with &#x00A3;2. 10<i>s</i>. per cent on the increased post revenue, according to the modification before stated; and that when a draft of this proposed appointment was laid before the then attorney general, he was of opinion that an act of parliament would be requisite to enable the minister to carry the agreement made with the petitioner into execution, as the Post-Office Act of the 9th of Queen Anne merely authorises appointments under the postmaster general, and in consequence of this obstacle the intended grant was suspended till the requisite act could be obtained; and that during this delay, the petitioner not having sufficient authority vested in him to forward and protect his plan, it got into great irregularity, owing to the neglect of the contractors, who had been induced to believe that he was unsupported by government, and that as the plan had to encounter fresh objections and memorials from the Post Office, it must necessarily be given up? therefore being disheartened by these apprehensions, as well as by the severity of the winter, and influenced by the advice and threats of those who were adverse to the plan, a combination was entered into, and bonds under heavy penalties executed among, many of the coachmasters as well as postmasters, not only to decline any mail-coach contracts, but to oppose them wherever attempted to be established; and that in this situation the petitioner found that unless he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0128"/>
<col>225</col>
immediately obtained some official powers, the plan must sink, and all his labour, anxiety, and expence be lost; and therefore, after representing his apprehensions to the Minister, and consenting to postpone the Completion of his agreement, till the requisite arrangements could be made respecting it, a limited appointment was in August, 1786, directed to be granted him by the postmaster general, under which he might be enabled to forward his plan, but with an assurance from Mr Pitt, that the full benefit of his agreement should be ultimately secured to him, and he at the same time obtained a warrant for a part of his expences, hot having till then received a shilling either for himself or his numerous agents, although more than four years had elapsed since the commencement of the business, as he was determined to adhere strictly to his proposal, that the plan should be proved efficient and beneficial to the public, before he would accept any remuneration whatever; and that having obtained this limited appointment, the petitioner without loss of time went into Scotland in order to arrange the posts of that kingdom, and afterwards to Paris for the purpose of establishing a daily packet and post connection between France and this country, so that he was not able to return to London till October, 1787; and that early in 1788 he was requested to go to Ire land, in order to settle regulations respecting the establishment of mail-coaches in that kingdom, and likewise for the forming better communications by packets between the northern and southern parts of that country, and the English ports; and that although the petitioner had during these intervals, in his frequent communications with Mr. Pitt, the most positive assurances, that after effecting these farther arrangements the agreement made with him should be no longer delayed, but settled to his entire satisfaction, yet, on his return, he had the mortification to encounter further impediments from the Post Office; and he therefore most earnestly and warmly pressed the minister to carry his agreement with him into immediate execution, and by granting him the promised powers put an end to these hostile attacks from the office, so injurious both to himself and the public; and that Mr. Pitt acknowledged the necessity as well as justice of this demand; and his anxious wish to comply with it; and at last observed, "That it would be a great satisfaction to his mind, and more fully authorise and justify the agreement with the public, if sanction
<col>226</col>
ed by the Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry, after their full investigation into the whole of the proceedings." Unexpected and distressing as this further procrastination was, the proposal appeared so candid and proper that the petitioner could not but consent to it; and that in 1788 the Commissioners of Inquiry made their Report as to the Post Office; and stated, with respect to the petitioner, "That he had performed his agreement with government far beyond his promise, not only as to expedition and safety, but at &#x00A3;20,000 per annum less than was proposed; and that he had accomplished his object in despite of numerous difficulties, and a most powerful opposition, and every obstruction that could be thrown in his way by the officers of the General Post Office; and therefore the commissioners declared the petitioner justly entitled to his specified compensation, being a very small part of that increased revenue which his integrity, activity, and zeal, had created, exclusive of the convenience and numerous collateral advantages which the country at large, and more particularly the commercial part of it, derived from his exertions;" and that, after this examination and decision by the commissioners, the petitioner, at the end of December 1788, wrote to the minister, requesting him to fulfil his original agreement, stating at the same time that he had Various other plans which he conceived of the greatest consequence to the correspondence of the kingdom and particularly of the metropolis and its neighbourhood, which waited this final adjustment to enable him to carry into execution: and that further delays now arose from the peculiar and unfortunate circumstances which occurred at that time, and the consequent embarrassments of government, and at last from the difficulties the petitioner experienced in his pecuniary concerns; wearied out with these continued mortifying and vexatious delays, to which he saw no probable end, and against which, or to compel the performance of his agreement, he had no legal remedy, he, at the earnest desire of the minister, consented to continue further to act with the limited and uncertain powers he hitherto had done, but under the strongest assurances on the part of Mr. Pitt, "that there should be no future interference with his regulations from the General Post Office, and that he should feel himself equally protected and advantaged in all respects as if possessed of the intended Patent Grant of 1785, and that he might be assured his agreement was
<image src="S1V0009P0I0129"/>
<col>227</col>
equally Valid as if sanctioned by an act of parliament; and that soon after a new appointment was sent to him, and he was paid, after seven years delay, the whole arrears of the salary and per centage to that time, and agreeably to his modified agreement of 1785, but he was allowed nothing for his time previous to the commencement of the plan in August 1714, or for his subsequent great expences in England, or even in France Or Ireland, nor was there any mentioned reversion of the situation for any of his family, as he was led to expect in the modification of his agreement in 1785, but he was told he must look to an ample recompence for all this in the great and increasing advantages of his per centages; and that however convenient the petitioner found this sum for the settlement of his pecuniary difficulties, in consequence of his attention to this business, and whatever pleasure he felt at the arrears, according to his modified agreement, being thus honourably discharged, yet he never failed expressing his dissatisfaction at the Patent Appointment of 1785 not being yet granted to him, or his original agreement not being fulfilled, and his fears and apprehensions of the consequences both to the public, his plan, and to himself; and that for some little time after this, however, the petitioner proceeded uninterruptedly, and to his satisfaction; but it being soon known at the Post Office that he had no legal authority, independent of the Postmaster General, the old opposition and intrigues revived, and were pursued for a considerable time, or at intervals, in a manner that might naturally be expected Where prejudice was so deeply rooted, and power in the exercise of persons so completely at variance with each other, and whose ideas of business, and the mode of conducting it, were so different; and that the former unwarrantable conduct to defeat the plan on one side, and unavoidably so to protect it on the other were again resorted to; on every occasion which the petitioner conceived of importance to his plan, or the revenue, he acted in the best manner he could for its advantage, and to alarm and deter the office from interfering in its conduct and, confiding in the spirit of his original agreement, he uniformly denied at such times the postmaster-general over him, asserted his agreement, and appealed to the minister, which generally produced a temporary cessation to this harrassing and injurious interference with his regulations, and he was frequently assured some line or other should be drawn,
<col>228</col>
or some effectual measure adopted, to put an end to it; and that at last the postmaster general suspended the petitioner, in March 1792, for disobedience of their orders, under this nominal appointment, which he had been compelled to act with to the best of his judgment, and independent of the postmaster-general; for, had he not done so on every occasion he thought necessary, and according to the powers described in the patent appointment drawn up in 1785, and I assured to him by the minister, he never could have carried his plan into execution, or the public been in the enjoyment of its advantages; and that after various remonstrances and answers between the postmaster-general and himself at the Board of Treasury, and with which, on the part of the petitioner, the minister expressed himself satisfied, he was compelled to leave the conduct of his plan to the office, as was originally intended, after he should have perfectly established it, but, of course, considered that he was not to be prejudiced in the profits arising from his agreement; and he intimated to the minister, that he still was ready to proceed to further great and extensive improvements, of material importance to the public convenience and the revenue, if granted the requisite powers promised him; and that, some time after this declaration a warrant was sent to the post office for the payment of the petitioner's arrears (according to his modified agreement in 1785) to April 1793; and the Board of Treasury gave him notice that they had settled an allowance of &#x00A3;3000 per ann. on him for his life, in compensation for his services; and that to this the petitioner declared, as he invariably had done, that he should consider himself extremely ill treated if he was paid in any degree short of his actual agreement; that Mr. Pitt had a right, if he thought proper, and as might suit his political convenience, to dispense with his services, but he could not in justice dispense with the engagements he had entered into with the petitioner; and that, in December 1794, after the usual period had elapsed of making up the annual accounts at the General Post Offices, the petitioner sent a memorial to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, stating his agreement, and requiring Post Offices accounts to April 1794, and the payment of the balance of salary and per centage due to him beyond the sum he had been paid (of &#x00A3;3000). In August, 1795, after various applications and waiting eight months, he received an answer, stat
<image src="S1V0009P0I0130"/>
<col>229</col>
ing, that their lordships were of opinion that the sum of &#x00A3;3000 per annum for his life was a just and full compensation for the services he had rendered, and that they did not think themselves justified on the part of the public to make any addition to that allowance; and that, in January 1796, (being shortly after the next meeting of parliament) the petitioner having advised with his counsel in the further steps necessary to be taken in this harrassing business, presented to the Board of Treasury a remonstrance to their answer, and proposed, that if their lordships conceived themselves unable to perform the agreement made with him, an application might be made to parliament on the subject, when the agreement, as well as his merits and his conduct, might be fully investigated; and that although an answer was promised in time for the petitioner to make such appeal, he did not receive it till the dissolution of parliament was determined on, and he had to wait the meeting of the new one in the following year, when a committee of the house was appointed "To consider of the agreements made with the petitioner for the reform and improvement of the Post Office and its revenue, and to inquire into the causes of his suspension, and report to the house the evidence received;" and that, in May 1797, the committee, after being occupied above five weeks on the subject, reported to the house the evidence received, which was ordered to be printed, and fully proved the agreement made with the petitioner as before stated.&#x2014; Ordered to lie upon the table.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[COMMERCE OF THE COUNTRY]. Lord Auckland</member> <membercontribution>called the attention of the house to a practice, which, from a sense of duty, he had so often pursued, in bringing forward, for the information of parliament, such annual accounts as were connected with any office that he had happened to fill. He was more especially induced to this, as he had resigned a few days ago the presidency of the committee of council for trade, an office of great importance and responsibility, which no prudent man would undertake or hold, unless he felt that he could have the confidence and co-operation of a strong and enlightened government. He was proud to believe that he had possessed the unreserved confidence of a government entitled to those epithets. The efficient offices of that government had been filled
<col>230</col>
by individuals of eminent talents, well suited to their respective departments. They had been aided in their councils by colleagues equally distinguished. They had stood high in the opinion of parliament, ant in the esteem and respect of foreign countries. In closing this description he felt a want of language to express what was due to the character of his honourable friend (lord Grenville); to the integrity, wisdom, and energy, of his mind; to his indefatigable zeal in the discharge of his public duties; to his solicitude for the interests, security, and prosperity of the empire. It was fair to attribute to such an administration some part of the wonderful increase which had taken place in our manufactures, commerce, and navigation, in the course of the last year. The papers for which he would now move would exhibit proofs of that increase far beyond all expectation and example.&#x2014;The comparative account of imports would shew that the total value, exclusive of prize goods, and of the India and China trade, had been,

Their lordships would be aware that a large proportion of those imports consists of materials of manufacture, such as flax, hemp, hides, iron, wood, yarn, dying goods, wool, and cotton; or of necessary consumption, such as, wine, spirits, oils, fish, fruit, and grain.&#x2014;The comparative value of British produce and manufacture exported from Great Britain for the same period, had been,

And here it might be material, to remark, that a similar account for the year 1794 had amounted only to 16,725,000<i>l</i>. He would not enter into the details, but would only observe that in the last year, ending the 5th of January 1807, there had been a great increase in the export of cottons, hardware, and woollen goods. He had also seen, with much satisfaction, and their lordships would find, that the prosperity of Scotland had kept pace with that of England. Such had been the effects of British energy, under an enlightened and provident government! Such was the actual predicament of the British empire, which our unprincipled and implacable enemy had vainly hoped to reduce to a bankruptcy, both of finance and of com-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0131"/>
<col>231</col>
merce. As to the bankruptcy in finance, his noble-friend (lord Grenville) had shewn, and had proved, to the conviction, and benefit, of his successors in office, and to his countrymen, that new taxes are no longer necessary, even for a prolonged war on the actual state of expenditure. As to any failure in commerce, the accounts now to be produced would give a splendid exhibition of imports and exports, far beyond what it had ever been in any period of peace or of war.&#x2014;Having said, in the opening of his speech, that he had enjoyed the full confidence of the late ministers, he requested permission to explain that in one great and essential point he had differed from them radically and most decidedly. His noble friend had been apprized in an early stage of the business, that it was his intention to oppose even the very limited measure which had been made the cause, or occasion, of the change of government; but having stated that dissent, he never felt, he never could feel, that alarm and anxiety which others feel, or pretend to feel, for what they call the safety of the church. It had happened to him only two years ago to be the teller on the, catholic question, when their lordships divided 178 to 49. He knew too well the consistency and honour of their lordships minds to have the smallest particle of doubt, that the principles which prevailed in 1805 would equally prevail in 1807. He sincerely lamented the misunderstanding and its consequences, which threatened to place this great empire in a state of divisions, weakness, and distractions, ill suited to the circumstances of the War, and to the tendency and unexampled dangers of the times on which we are thrown. Lord Auckland concluded by moving for several accounts of the official and real imports into and exports from Great Britain, for nine years, ending the 5th January, 1807; and also for comparative accounts of British shipping for the same period.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member> <membercontribution>said, he did not rise to controvert the statements of the noble lord, but merely to observe, that the grounds of such a statement proved the administration of which the noble lord formed a part, did not succeed to the government of a ruined country, or to dilapidated resources.&#x2014; The question on the noble lord's motion was put, and the accounts ordered accordingly.</membercontribution></p>

called the attention of their lordships to the subject of which he had given notice yesterday. The principal points of his lordship's speech, which occupied upwards of three hours in the delivery, were to the following effect.&#x2014;I do not mean to offer any objection to the motion which has just been made; but I rise for the purpose of stating, as your lordships all know it is competent for me on this question to do, the circumstances which have led to the present situation of public affairs. I mean to explain, as far as I am acquainted with them, the causes which have brought about the change which has taken place in his majesty's councils. It is now six years since the members of a former administration, of which I formed a part, thought it their duty, under similar circumstances, to ask permission of his majesty to withdraw from their situations. This determination they carried into execution without communicating through any channel to the public the grounds which had induced them to take that step. I participated fully in the motives of forbearance on which that conduct was founded. I am far from now regretting that the change did take place in that manner. But it must be in the recollection of all your lordships, that the motives of the persons who composed the administration to which I have alluded, were made the subject of much comment, and were greatly misrepresented in consequence of that forbearance to which they adhered. On the present occasion, then, when a change of administration has taken place, not by resignation, but in consequence of the exercise of the royal prerogative, it is natural that I, who know the misrepresentations which occurred in a former instance, should wish to avoid similar imputations, by making to your lordships, and thro' you to the country, a full explanation of all the circumstances which have given rise to the existing situation of public affairs. But I have still a much stronger claim to your lordships indulgence in making this statement. It has happened that a libellous publication has already appeared, containing a false and garbled representation of the circumstances to which I allude; and here let me ask the noble lords on the other side, whether they can point out any period of the history of this country in which it ever happened that such a publication was made? I speak of the publication of the minutes of advice given to his majesty by his late ministers. That advice was given to his majesty in writing, and though it was proper that the paper should
<image src="S1V0009P0I0132"/>
<col>233</col>
be transferred to the persons who succeeded to the administration, in order that they might know the grounds upon which their predecessors were dismissed, it was a very extraordinary proceeding in those persons to authorize its publication. If they thought it a fit document for public discussion, either in or out of parliament, there were two ways in which they might have proceeded, in order to promote a constitutional investigation. They might have come down to parliament and stated, that improper advice had been given to the crown, and upon that statement moved an address to his majesty for the production of the paper; or they might have adopted another course. If they found upon their accession to the government, that evil counsels had been given, they might have advised his majesty to lay those counsels before parliament, in order that those from whom they proceeded might receive the punishment they merited. But will the noble lords on the opposite side vindicate the publication of a paper of this important nature in the manner it has taken place? I must again ask them whether they can refer to any instance, in the history of the country in which any similar publication had, from party views or any other motive, ever been made? Under these circumstances, however, I could not refrain from desiring to lay before your lordships the truth of the case on this important subject, which had, in consequence of the publication I have noticed, become the subject of conversation and misrepresentation in every coffee-house. For this purpose, I was induced to ask leave of his majesty to make the statement I am about to lay before your lordships; for without that permission, I should not, most anxiously as I desired to explain every circumstance connected with the important transactions that have taken place, have taken this opportunity of addressing your lordships. But my application to his majesty was received with all that kindness and tenderness to the feelings of others for which his royal mind is so eminently distinguished, and I shall ever entertain the strongest sense of gratitude for the benevolent condescension with which the permission I solicited was granted. Having now stated the grounds on which I think it will appear that an explanation on my part was indispensably called for, it scarcely can he necessary for me to assure your lordships, that whatever I may say in addressing you will be accompanied with every feeling of respect which is due to the sovereign of these
<col>234</col>
realms. I have, my lords, no complaint to make; I have only to state what is necessary for the vindication of my own character &#x2014;At the period of the change of administration, to which I have already referred, your lordships know that a great and illustrious statesman, (Mr. Pitt), to whom I never can allude but with sentiments of the most unfeigned respect, was at the head of his majesty's government. My lords, in the year 1801, it was the opinion of that illustrious statesman in which opinion I completely concurred, that large further concessions should be made to the catholics of Ireland. It was then thought expedient that a measure for that purpose should be proposed to parliament. That proposed measure not meeting with his majesty's approbation, the consequence was the resignation of the then ministers. The result was different in the present case, for reasons which I shall presently state. I at that period thought it my duty to resign, and chearfully sacrifice all those personal considerations which may be supposed to attach to the situation of one of his majesty's ministers. My lords, I will sacrifice those considerations over and over again, upon the same principle. It is undoubtedly true, that no pledge was given to the catholics of Ireland that further concessions to them should be one of the results of the union; their consent was undoubtedly not purchased by any seal promise. It is well known, however, from the speeches in parliament, upon the great question of the union, and we know that what is said in parliament, somehow or other becomes known to the public, that the understanding upon the subject certainly was, that further concessions to the catholics of Ireland, might, and ought to be a measure consequent upon the union. That such a measure was net only politic and expedient, but absolutely necessary, was the opinion, as I have already stated, of that great and illustrious statesman, Mr. Pitt; it was also the opinion of his great and illustrious rival, Mr. Fox. These eminent statesmen concurred in opinion in three great measures of policy, the establishment of the sinking fund, the abolition of the African slave trade, and the necessity of further concessions to the catholics of Ireland. The first of these measures was adopted on its first proposition; the second, the abolition of the African slave trade, met with much, in my opinion, mistaken opposition, but has at length been carried. The third, that of a system of conciliation and kindness to the catholics of Ireland, remains
<image src="S1V0009P0I0133"/>
<col>235</col>
yet to be carried into execution; but it rests upon grounds of such unavoidable necessity, that I think it is impossible for any man, after weighing on the one hand the objections which have been urged against it, and on the other the advantages which must inevitably flow from it, to resist the corning to this conclusion, that it is a measure which, for the welfare of the country, ought to be speedily adopted. It was in this view that on a former occasion I sacrificed my situation in the government; and that sacrifice I was ready to make again, being convinced that four millions of our fellow subjects in Ireland are to be governed by conciliation and kindness, and not by persecution. In consequence of circumstances which occurred in the situation of public affairs, which it is not necessary here to restate, overtures were repeatedly made to me to take a part in his majesty's councils. My answer to all such overtures was, that my sovereign might always command my services in any frame of government which might be formed, but at the same time I always explicitly declared, that I never would forego my right to state my sentiments on this question in parliament, whenever any occasion should occur which might call for such a statement. A time arrived when the Roman catholics of Ireland thought fit to represent to parliament the state of their grievances. They did me the honour to apply to me to present their Petition. [See vol. 4, p. 97.] I felt that application, my lords, to be an honour, because it was a proof of the opinion those persons entertained of my conduct and sincerity. I complied with their wishes. But here, my lords, it is proper that I should correct a misapprehension which has very generally prevailed on this subject. It is not true, as has been frequently asserted, that the consent of the Roman catholics of Ireland to the union was purchased in consequence of any promise made to them of a measure of complete conciliation; but it is certain, from the debates that took place on the Union, that it was understood that the catholic question should be fully considered, and on this ground I considered myself bound to bring their claims before your lordships. The result of the application which was made to parliament is well known. The majority against the measure, large as it was, could not be considered as precluding its revival at a future period, or as imposing any pledge on parliament not to accede to the catholic claims to the full extent in which they were then made, In a
<col>236</col>
few months after I had the honour to make the application,,the result of which I have mentioned, the country had the misfortune to lose the great stateman who was at the head of the existing administration. His majesty was then pleased to think that, under the circumstances in which the country was placed, I might be of use to him and to the public, and directed me to assist in forming a new government. I did form one, which, from the materials of which it was composed, and the principles on which its members agreed to act together, appeared to me best calculated for promoting the interests of the country. The sentiments of most of the persons who became members of this administration, upon the catholic question, were well known from their public declarations, and particularly in consequence of the discussion which had recently taken place on the subject. When, therefore, we were called to the councils of our sovereign, no man could suppose that we were called in any other manner than that in which ministers ought constitutionally to discharge their duty; namely, to give on all proper occasions to his majesty, conformably to the oath we had taken, full, fair, and upright counsel, and not to withhold that advice from interest, affection or any other motive. I do not make this assertion, my lords, from my own recollection only. Within these few days my sovereign has declared it to be conformable to his recollection also, and authorized me to confirm this statement, not from myself only, but from him. After what had recently happened, it will not be supposed that it could be the desire of the late administration to press the catholic question, or to revive any measure known to be painful to the feelings of a great personage, to whom every respect is due, unless the pressure of unavoidable necessity compelled us to bring it forward. We flattered ourselves, therefore, that from the character of the persons to whom the government of Ireland was entrusted, many causes of dissatisfaction in the people of that country would be diminished. The manner in which the noble person at the head of that government (the duke of Bedford) executed the laws, and the just but conciliating spirit of his administration, gave us reason to hope that the unanimity so much desired in the sister kingdom might at last be accomplished. We had but one wish, the welfare and security of the whole empire; and, by knitting together the hearts of all his majesty's subjects, we cherished the hope that this
<image src="S1V0009P0I0134"/>
<col>237</col>
great object might be attained. We were induced to pursue this conduct, as well because we knew the agitation of the subject might prove painful in a high quarter, as because the recent decision of parliament had rendered it very unlikely that it could be carried, while it was probable that it would revive animosities. One of the first objects of the late administration, therefore, was to prevent, if possible, the revival of the Catholic question. In the first session of parliament our endeavours were successful; but the state of Ireland during the last year was not so satisfactory; disturbances had broken out in several districts, disturbances of that nature which this measure was particularly calculated to prevent. These commotions were, however, composed by the ordinary exercise of the civil administration of the country. Such was the love of justice and lenity which distinguished the noble duke at the head of the government of Ireland, that he carefully avoided resorting to any extraordinary measures in repressing these disturbances, and his system of conciliation had proved succesful. At the time these events occurred in Ireland, the attention of his majesty's government in this country was anxiously directed to the means of raising a great military force, which the total destruction of the power of Prussia had rendered more than ever necessary for the security of the British Empire. No measure could be so well calculated to promote that end as one which would induce the superabundant population of Ireland to enter into the army and navy, and for such a proceeding the great earl of Chatham had set an important example, when, in order to remove the disaffection of the Highlands of Scotland, then nearly in the same situation as Ireland now was, he held out inducements for the population of those districts to enlist in the army. With regard to the state of Ireland, until the wealthy yeomanry could be interested, by having opportunities of providing for the younger branches of their families, similar to these afforded to the same description of persons in this country, it was in vain to expect that they would exert their influence in recruiting for the army. Besides, those persons who have the charge of religious instruction in that country, will never, with any zeal, encourage men to enter into a service where the exercise of then worship is not protected by law. It was to remove these difficulties that the measure which had been lately withdrawn in the house of commons was introduced to the consideration of
<col>238</col>
parliament. With regard to the general question, I hesitate not to declare it to be my opinion, that the Roman Catholics, by pushing forward their petition at the present moment, have acted highly injurious to their own interests, and to the interests of the empire at large. It was therefore my anxious wish, as well as that of those who acted with me, to devise some means by which the discussion of the general question in parliament might have been prevented, and nothing appeared to us better calculated for that purpose than the bill, which was intended to give to all the subjects of his majesty the right of holding every description of military employment. About fourteen years ago, the parliament of Ireland opened to the Roman catholics the army, with the exclusion only of the rank of commander in chief, master-general of the ordnance, and general of the staff. With these exceptions, his majesty was enabled to give commissions in the army to all his catholic subjects in Ireland; and there was no doubt, from the construction of the act, that it opened to them the navy also, in so far as the authority of the Irish parliament could extend to that service. As this act, however, could not extend to the catholics in Great Britain, it operated as an obstruction to the removal of the military force from the one country to the other. So absurd, so incongruous a state of law, never existed in any nation in the world. Instead of asking why it is not put an end to, the question ought rather to be, how it is possible that it could have existed so long? In such a state of things, was it to be wondered that we should endeavour to apply a remedy, and when we were to propose to the catholics in every part of the empire to enter into the army or the navy, we resolved not to make that proposition upon a narrow principle, but to call them to a liberal system of service, and to open to them every rank. Here, however, another point arose, which it was necessary to meet fairly. In the year 1778 the Irish parliament thought proper to open to the Protestant dissenters in Ireland, not only the navy and the army, but all employments whatever. Therefore in 1795, when it fell to the lot of my noble friend, who was then at the head of the Irish government, to propose the admission Of the catholics into the army and the navy, he had no occasion to enter into any consideration as to the situation of the dissenters. In England, however, the case is different; here dissenters are excluded from all public
<image src="S1V0009P0I0135"/>
<col>239</col>
employments unless they take a sacramental test, which is contrary to the principles of their religious faith. If we had adopted the Irish act of 1793 in this country, the catholics would have been admitted to offices from which the Protestants were excluded. Let me ask your lordships, whether such a measure would not have awakened the attention of the protestant dissenters? And what answer could you have given to them, if they asked you to explain the reason of the distinction made between them and the catholics? Regarding the question, then, under all those points of view, I was induced to form the decided opinion that the measure to be submitted to parliament in the form of an act, should, after reciting the danger to which the empire was exposed, also recite the remedy by which all hearts and hands might be united in warding off every attempt of the inveterate foe of this country. I am aware that much may be expected to be said on the manner in which the measure was brought forward. In the first place it may be observed, that it is the duty of all members of parliament to propose those measures which they may conceive to be conducive to the welfare of the country. In the like manner it is the duty of the members of government to submit to his majesty such measures as they may think calculated to promote the interests of the public. If his majesty should not approve of any measure they may suggest, they have then to chuse whether they will abandon that measure, or tender their resignation to their sovereign. I need not tell you, my lords, that in the recent instance which has occurred of this difference of opinion, the former course was that which was adopted. In the other case, in 1801, when a similar measure was proposed to the king, and disapproved by him, the administration of that day thought proper to resign. In the present case, however, the same result was brought about in a different manner. The measure was withdrawn, and it was intended to suffer it to drop entirely; but his majesty had, in the mean time, thought fit to appoint a new administration. I shall, my lords, endeavour to state as briefly as possible the circumstances which gave rise to this event. A misapprehension of the nature and extent of the measure proposed appears to have taken place, and the statement of that misapprehension comes from a quarter to which I give the most implicit credit. In the explanation I am about to make, I only wish to shew that I, and those with
<col>240</col>
whom I acted, had reason to suppose that the nature of the measure was fully understood, which, from my heart and soul, I am convinced it was not. I only mean to justify our characters by stating the reasons which induced us to suppose that no misapprehension existed. In doing this, my lords, it will be necessary for me to recapitulate the different stages of the proceedings which took place. The draft of the Bill was laid before the king for his approbation. That draft contained a recital of the Irish Act with the restriction. It then proposed that the services of catholics should be received without any restriction, and no condition required but the taking of the oath of allegiance. When this draft was submitted to his Majesty, I thought I had done every thing on the subject which my duty required of me. Afterwards, however, I learned that difficulties were stated, and that there was a repugnance in his majesty's mind to the measure. A written answer to this effect was received by his majesty's servants, and to which a representation was returned. I am sure, my lords, there is no man into whose hands that representation may have fallen, but must regard it as a most dutiful and respectful address, such as was fit to be presented to the best of sovereigns by his servants. On that representation his majesty was pleased to give orders that the bill might be submitted to parliament. A dispatch was immediately sent to Ireland, in order that his majesty's consent having been obtained, it might be communicated to the catholics. At the conference which took place in consequence of this proceeding between the government of Ireland and certain persons, who possess great influence with the catholic body, a question was asked, whether the rank of general of the staff, and other employments, from which the catholics were excluded by the act of 1793, were to be laid open to them? The answer given on the part of his majesty's government in Ireland was, that from the words of the dispatch they understood that the catholics were to be allowed to hold every rank in the army and the navy. The lord lieutenant's dispatch, containing the account of this conference, was, as all such dispatches are, communicated to his majesty, and by him returned without any comment. In answer to it, another dispatch was sent to Ireland, for the purpose of giving full information of the nature of the measure to the catholics, which was also laid before his majesty. This dispatch contained copies of the clauses of the bi11, and a re-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0136"/>
<col>241</col>
mark was subjoined, that these clauses laid open the army and navy to the Roman catholics, and enabled the lord lieutenant to answer the question, which had been put on that point in the affirmative. After all that I have stated has taken place, what must be the feelings of men who read in libellous publications assertions openly made of their having deceived his majesty. For God's sake, my lords, let us stand clear of this foul calumny. Let us not be unjustly accused, I will not say of deceiving our amiable and benevolent sovereign, but of obtaining from any man by fraudulent means, his consent to a measure which he disapproved. I have stated what was the understanding of my colleagues on this subject, and, in particular, of a noble viscount, who had a principal share in all the transactions; and a man of a more refined and punctilions sense of honour than lord Howick does not exist. It fell to the lot of that noble lord to receive those official directions which he understood authorised him to submit the measure to the consideration of parliament. Here, indeed, a difference of opinion arose between the person to whom the question was addressed and the person who asked it, as to the impression which the answer ought to have produced. This much however, I can say, that the person who asked the question came away with the impression that the permission solicited was granted. I was waiting almost at the door of the chamber in which the conference took place, and I witnessed the effect of the recent impression on the mind Of lord Howick. He stated to me, that he had obtained permission to introduce the bill, On my entering into the chamber immediately after, I forbore to allude to what was considered a delicate subject, and not a word was said to me respecting the conference Which had just taken place with lord Howick. This conversation occurred on Wednesday the 4th of March: on the Thursday or Friday following, with that perspicuity which is peculiar to him, lord Howick explained to the house of commons the nature of the measure proposed to be adopted. The speech of that noble lord soon became the subject of public conversation, for we know, my lords, that the speeches of members of parliament on important occasions do, by some means or other, get abroad; but, notwithstanding the publicity of that speech, it was not until the Wednesday following that I was informed of any objection having arisen to the measure. On that day we were for the first time informed, that the impression which we supposed to
<col>242</col>
have been so well founded, had been formed erroneously. This naturally gave rise to an anxious desire for explanation on our part; and here permit me to observe, that while they who know nothing of what passed, presume to say that we have been guilty of fraud and concealment, his majesty, who knows all that did take place, has the goodness to declare, that the difference which has arisen was only a difference on principle, and that all that had passed, on every occasion, was strictly honourable. This, my lords, is a declaration of great importance to me, were it only to prove the Sentiments which prevail in the royal breast; but how muds more important is it to me when it serves at the same time to repel the foul calumny with which I have been assailed. In this situation of affairs we adopted a resolution, which, of all these transactions, I confess it would he for me the most difficult to justify, and which nothing but the mistaken impression which we had fallen into could excuse. We determined to withdraw the bill. On the Friday I intimated to his majesty the sacrifice we had resolved to make. At first we intended to reduce the bill to the same provisions as the Irish bill of 1793; but, upon examination, we found that impracticable, as it would then have appeared in a shape to which unanswerable objections would have been made. We then informed his majesty, that we were determined to make a still more complete sacrifice, and to drop the bill altogether. Perhaps it may be thought that we went too far, but after the mistake which had occurred, is was our wish to accommodate, as much as possible, our actions to his majesty's feelings. But when we did allow the bill to fall to the ground, though we did not mean to propose any other measures than those which his majesty approved, we thought it necessary to reserve to ourselves the right of stating our opinion of the great benefits which we were persuaded might be derived front pursuing a different line of policy&#x2014;of openly avowing these sentiments in the event of the catholic petition being presented&#x2014;and of submitting to his majesty from time to time, <i>for his decision</i>, such measures as we might think it adviseable to propose. I have placed an emphasis on these words, "for his decision," because you will perceive, my lords, that they are left out in the publication to which I have alluded, evidently for the purpose of making it appear that we meant to force upon his majesty measures contrary to his feelings and his conscience.&#x2014;I come now,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0137"/>
<col>243</col>
my lords, to state a circumstance which placed his majesty's government in a situation in which it was impossible it could stand, as it would have been divested of all constitutional responsibility. The answer to the representation made to his majesty, expressed regret that such a difference of opinion should have arisen, and required a written declaration that we should propose no farther concessions to the catholics. After all that had passed, a more painful situation could not have arisen. I beg of you, my lords, to consider what are the duties of the king's ministers, and what is the nature of the functions they have to discharge. It is their duty to advise the king, and to give, without favour or affection, that counsel which they think best for the country. What, then, would be the situation of any set of men who should hind themselves by oath to discharge this important office, and at the same time bind themselves by a written promise not to discharge it? It they meant to adhere to the written promise rather than to their oath, they would resolve to advise their sovereign always according to his wishes, but never according to his interests. In no very remote period it may be necessary, for the security of a principal part of the empire, to repeat the advice which has been recently given to his majesty, for the enemy has already pretty plainly shewn against what part of the united kingdom his first attempt will be directed. But I wish to look at this subject in a still larger and more important point of view than even the safety of Ireland, if that be possible. Will the British constitution exist if ministers give a pledge of the nature of that which has been described? And before this question be answered, let it be recollected, that as such a pledge was required of the ministers who have retired, upon every fair construction it must have been given by those Who have come into office. If calamities should befal the other part of the united kingdom, and those ministers should be asked why certain advice respecting its situation was not given, they must answer, that they have given a pledge not to take that subject into their consideration; that Ireland was a corner which had been cut out of the map of the empire they received into their keeping. If this doctrine, my lords, prevails, the cornerstone of our constitution, namely, the maxim that the king can do no wrong, and that his ministers only are responsible, is completely gone. If an opinion should prevail in parliament that ministers ought to have given
<col>244</col>
certain advice, and they should state that they had entered into a pledge not to give it, consider, my lords, where the responsibility then must fall. We should then return to principles which must sap the foundation of the monarchy, to those, I had almost said, diabolical principles, by which the king of this country was once brought to answer to his parliament, and considered responsible for all the transactions of the government. Those who best know me, my lords, can declare, that when I came into the service of my sovereign, it was not a matter of enjoyment, but of duty, and I am now relieved from it, at a time when the difficulties of executing that duty are still of great magnitude. Let not those who have succeeded us imagine that they have succeeded to an easy task. We did not succeed to "a bed of roses," neither have we left "a bed of roses." My noble friend (lord Auckland), has stated to your lordships the growing prosperity of the commerce of the country, which was received with a sort of taunt from a noble lord on the other side. The commerce and the finances of the country we have left somewhat better than we found them. Our foreign relations we have left in a better state than we found them. Let me, however, call the serious and anxious attention of noble lords on the other side to the state of Ireland. If persecution for the sake of differences in religions opinions are again to be revived in this country, can there be a question that it will produce the most dreadful dissensions? and if, my lords, the system acted upon in Ireland by the noble duke who represents his majesty in that country, or the noble lord in the blue ribbon (the earl of Hardwicke) his predecessor, is to be reversed, and a system of persecution, coercion and restraint to be substituted, no human being can foresee the incalculable mischiefs that will result from such a system. When we know that our enemy has fixed upon one point of the British dominions where he thinks invasion practicable, and that that point is Ireland, surely it requires more than ordinary care, more than ordinary measures, to remove the causes of all those unhappy dissensions which have given rise to this hope of the enemy, and which have given rise in that country to those insurrections which have produced such dreadful effects. If they do not consider the state of Ireland with these views, the greatest danger may result to the interests of the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>expressed his regret that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0138"/>
<col>245</col>
any thing should have occurred that should render it necessary to state these transactions and, as it were, raise an issue between the sovereign and his servants. But the necessity having occurred, and garbled and fallacious statements having been made, nothing remained but to request his majesty to allow them to state the whole affair exactly as it took place. This permission had been given, and his noble friend near him had done his duty, in placing the matter in its proper light. But, what he was most particularly anxious to press upon the house, was this that there was a real misunderstanding on this business from the beginning, because many persons might be disposed to think it rather extraordinary that there could have been such a misunderstanding. The noble viscount proceeded to state, that from the discussions which took place on this subject, at which he himself had been present, he had understood that there was no intention to extend the measure further than it was carried by the Irish act of 1793. It appeared to him absurd that an officer in the army in Ireland should be liable to a penalty, if holding the same office in this country. Another step followed, which was, that if the privileges of the act of 1793, were to be extended in this country to the Irish catholics, the British catholics Ought to be included. But others, however, understood it otherwise. Lord Howick and his noble friend understood it otherwise, and Mr. Elliot had his doubts, and declined giving any answer to Mr. O'Conner, one of the Irish catholics, who questioned him on that subject, till the doubt should be removed. He then put the question to his noble friend, and learned that it was intended to enable the catholics to become major-generalson the staff, or commanders in chief. That was not, however, the principle of the Irish act of 1793. The dispatch sent to his majesty did not contain any thing that must necessarily imply that the measure would go beyond that of 1793. For though it contained the words, "any military commissions whatsoever;" yet these might not be understood as covering the staff appointments; and what might further tend to lead his majesty to think so was, that these alterations were to be introduced as clauses in the mutiny bill. And what serves further to shew, that the words "military commissions might readily be understood as not including the staff appointments, was that the wards "and appointments" were consider-
<col>246</col>
ed as necessary in the bill. Their lordships would feel, therefore, that the misconception might very naturally have arisen. At a subsequent period dispatches had been sent to his majesty, and ministers had attended him: what passed on these occasions he could not take upon him to say. That the impression of lord Howick was, that his majesty had consented to carry the measure further than that of 1793, he had no doubt. But their lordships, looking at the misconception that had prevailed at the beginning in the cabinet, and he appealed for this to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, their lordships looking at this would not, he trusted, think it extraordinary that under the particular circumstances of this case there should have been a misconception.&#x2014; As to the subject of toleration, he should be glad to see any one who would go further in that respect than himself; but he always had, and always would make a distinction between toleration and power. Every subject had a right to toleration; but power was only given as a trust by the supreme power, which ought to withhold it where the granting of it would be attended with danger. He had always opposed any minute concessions, in point of power, to the Catholics, as highly dangerous, because these would not remove their discontents, and might bring destruction on the church establishment. When he had entered into power, he had distinctly stated that he would not compromise his sentiments on this subject, as he thought they were essential to the preservation of our constitution. He would not enter upon this topic at present, but he thought that we ought to stop at the point where the union left us; and while he abhorred as much as any man the raising an outcry on account of religious differences, yet he felt what was due to the constitution and the church establishment of the country. That was the principle on which he acted. He knew that his opinions clashed with those of the wisest and best men whom this country had ever produced, but on this point he had judged for himself, and he could allow no human authority to controul the conviction of his mind. When he came into an administration which, he would say, had most unfortunately for the country been dissolved, his opinions were known. He had distinctly stated these opinions, and that no consideration could induce him to compromise them. He lamented that this difference should have occurred
<image src="S1V0009P0I0139"/>
<col>247</col>
between his majesty and his late servants; but he was satisfied, and he hoped their lordships were satisfied, that there had been an evident misconception on the part of his majesty with regard to the extent to which the bill was carried.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>said, he had never heard the noble viscount with more real satisfaction, than during the speech which he had just finished, because he perceived that his noble friend had not abandoned those principles upon which they had formerly acted. When this measure had been brought forward, he felt considerable satisfaction that his noble friend was a member of administration, because he was convinced that the country had in him in the cabinet a security against the attempt to break down the church establishment. He was fully sensible of the delicacy of the question before the house; he felt the delicacy of the discussion when a question was at issue between a subject and his sovereign. It was not for him to decide whether or not this discussion could have been avoided. Much had been said by the noble baron and the noble viscount of the publications that had taken place on this subject. Of these he knew nothing, and felt as much regret as any person that such statements should have found their way to the public. But he must observe, that previous to his having any knowledge of the transaction, there had been many rumours in circulation, directly contrary to the fact, and proved to be so by the statement of the noble baron himself, which had proceeded, no doubt, from individuals not connected with his majesty's government. Under these circumstances, he had thought it his duty to request the permission of his sovereign, after notice of the noble baron's intention had been given, to communicate the Whole circumstances of the case to his friends, in order, that if this discussion should unfortunately come on, they might be prepared to meet it, and to state on the part of his majesty, what were those principles, both with regard to the honour of the crown and the interests of the empire, that had induced him to adopt the course which he had taken. The catholic subject was not a new one. It had, often been under consideration, and had, about two years since, after the most ample discussion in both houses of parliament, been decided upon by the largest majorities ever known, considering the character and talents of the persons who had brought it forward. The noble baron had stated What would be the
<col>248</col>
effect of the measure, both as to its immediate result, and with reference to its future consequences; but he should beg leave to state what had been the feelings of that illustrious person (Mr. Pitt), whose virtues, character, and unrivalled abilities, were universally admired, beloved, and revered, but who unfortunately was there no more, upon this subject When that distinguished person had come last into office, though he had before withdrawn from his public situation in consequence of this measure, yet knowing the honest conscientious principles that prevailed against it, principles which ought to be upheld in any quarter, but still more in that exalted quarter in which they existed, he had, not in consequence of any pledge demanded of him, but voluntarily, engaged not to bring forward the question. He stated this as a fact known to himself, and not as a reproach to the noble baron; he stated merely what had been the opinion and feeling upon this subject of so high an authority, for which the noble baron must entertain as sincere a respect as himself. He had less difficulty in stating this, because he had always differed from his late right hon. friend upon this question. He agreed entirely with the noble viscount, that if the policy pursued should not be steady on this head, they would be continually fomenting troubles and discontents. Whilst he was ready to admit that no ordinary law should be unchangeable, there were fundamental laws which ought not to be altered, except upon the utmost pressing necessity. The right of petition, the trial by jury, and the independence of the judges, were fundamental principles of the constitution, and a protestant government and establishment were equally so. The same changes that might be wise with respect to other laws, were not to be applied to fundamental laws. They might alter the constitution of the army, the establishment of the navy, the regulations of the revenue, or, as they were at that tine in the course of doing, the administration of justice; but if any such change were to be carried into effect with respect to the national establishment,it would overthrow the constitution. This doctrine might be termed bigotry: but he should prefer to any new lights, the bigotry of 1688; which had effected the revolution, and established the liberties of this Country on the most solid foundation. Before he should comment upon what had been stated by the noble baron, he begged to say a few words upon the subject of the parti-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0140"/>
<col>249</col>
cular measure that had led to the present circumstances. He could not conceive any practical good that could result from it. He had differed with the noble lords opposite on the catholic claims, and on that subject he,could understand their arguments; but it was otherwise with respect to this measure. Had they any reason to think that this measure would have satisfied the catholics, or, that having obtained this, they would not equally desire every thing else? This measure was to give them the sword, but to refuse them every thing beside; and yet he had never conversed with any person upon the subject, who would not rather grant to the catholics what his majesty's ministers by this measure refused them, and refuse what they granted. He was adverse to the measure, because it would grant what was dangerous to give, and what was not calculated to give satisfaction, or to produce content.&#x2014; He came next to consider the misunderstanding that had taken place upon the subject. In observing upon this part of the statement of the noble baron, and in supplying some particulars which had been omitted by him, he did not feel any inclination to detract from the credit due to the noble baron's statement, or to give a partial colour to the case. If he should be guilty of any inaccuracy, the noble baron would, he trusted, correct him; for in the observations which he proposed to make, he was actuated by a desire of promoting the honour of the crown, the dignity of the king, and, with reference to themselves, of discharging a most scrupulous duty. The noble baron had accurately stated that the measure had originated in the dispatch from the Irish government. That dispatch had been laid before his majesty, and upon an attentive perusal of the contents of that dispatch, he was of the opinion of his noble friend, that all that was desired in the dispatch was the extension of the provisions of the Irish act generally: this was the impression upon his mind on reading the dispatch, and the same impressions seemed to have been felt by Mr. Elliot, who, when asked by the catholic deputies, whether the measure was to remove the limitations of the Irish act, declined an explicit answer, till he should refer the question to the British government. His majesty had, in the first instance, un-equivocally and strongly declared his disapprobation of the measure. In consequence of this disapprobation, a long cabinet minute had been laid before his majesty, detailing, in an able manner, the reasons for the adoption
<col>250</col>
of the measure, with a view to induce him to retract his objection, and to consent to a measure of a limited nature. It was impossible, therefore, that either the noble viscount, or the noble and learned lord, could have supposed that the measure was to go further than to make the provisions of the Irish act general. A. doubt might indeed have been felt, and he had entertained that feeling, whether the measure was only to include Irish catholics or the catholics of the empire. But upon a more attentive perusal of the minute, he, was convinced that it had been. proposed to extend the provisions of the measure to the catholics of the empire. He stated this to prove, that by every argument which had been used to obtain his majesty's consent to the measure, it was clear that the bill proposed was only to extend the provisions of the Irish bill. His majesty was assured, that it was only the same measure to which he had consented in 1793, and that the present measure was only intended to carry into effect that act, according to the principle upon which it had been enacted. That principle had been to give to the catholics the privilege of holding certain commissions in the army, at the same time reserving others; and if the principle of the act of 1793 were to have been the principle of the proposed measure, he contended that the reservation formed as,much a part of that principle, as the admission of certain commissions. This opinion he felt more strongly, from the manner in which the measure had been brought forward, so different from that which had been first proposed. It had been at first intended to carry the principle into effect, by the introduction of clauses for that purpose; but when it was determined on to carry the measure farther than was at first proposed, it was found that a clause in the mutiny bill cooler not make that law general, which had been before limited, and therefore a separate bill had been thought necessary. The result of all he had stated was, that no proposition could be clearer than that the first object was only to make the Irish act of 1793 the general law of the empire. How the misapprehension upon the subject arose it was not for him to decide, and certainly he would be the last man in such a case to assert or suspect that the misapprehension was wilful on either side. He had, however, authority to state, that on the 3d of March a communication had been made to his majesty on the subject, and on the 4th lord Howick
<image src="S1V0009P0I0141"/>
<col>251</col>
had an audience of his majesty at the Queen's Palace. At this interview his majesty had stated his objections to the measure, but he was ready to admit that the noble lord had felt convinced in his own mind, that nothing had fallen from the august personage during his audience that precluded him from opening the measure as he had done to parliament. When, however, the misapprehension that had taken place had been more explicitly stated, the noble baron, and the noble viscount, and the other members of the cabinet, had considered the subject in a long consultation, to ascertain whether the bill could be modified so as to answer the purpose for which it had been intended; the result of which was, that they thought it better to drop the bill altogether, with some observations, of which he proposed to take some notice before he should sit down. In withdrawing the bill, it appeared that they had made two reserves; first, that they should be at liberty to declare their opinions on the general policy of the measure; as well on the withdrawing the bill, as on the event of the catholic petition being presented. The second reserve was, that as a government they should be at liberty to bring the subject from time to time under his majesty's consideration, by recommending such measures0as they might deem proper to be adopted. Where any individual consents to give up any measure, he had no doubt a right to propose conditions; but in this case there were two parties, and though the ministers had a right to propose conditions, the situation of his majesty was not to be forgotten. He Should not say that they had not conscientiously proposed these reserves, but he asked their lordships to consider what would have been the situation of the king, if he had acceded to the proposition? What would have been the effect of such an assent, but to divide the unity of the executive? Would it not be to destroy the constitution, one of the wise maxims of which was, that the king could do no wrong, thereby casting a veil over his sacred character? Would it not have the effect of casting the whole odium upon his majesty of resisting the measure and of giving the whole popularity to his ministers? Was his majesty to wait until the time should arrive, when his ministers might think it convenient to bring the question again forward with more prospect of effect? He was not aware of any other alternative his majesty had when they had refused to withdraw their statement, or to make any promise respecting the future, but
<col>252</col>
that which he had adopted. The noble baron's opinion had certainly been known to his majesty on this subject, but his majesty could not know when he might think fit to bring the matter forward, or whether his opinion upon it might not have derived additional strength from the decision upon the question by the greatest majorities, that had ever been known upon any public question. But when they had given up their half measure, it was rather extraordinary that they should reserve the power of bringing forward the whole question. All that he had authority to state on the part of his majesty was, that the measure which had been brought in was widely different from that which had been sanctioned by his majesty, at first proposed. He could distinctly state, with reference to this subject, that until he had been called upon, in conjunction With his noble and learned friend (lord Eldon), by his majesty, he was ignorant of this transaction. But having been so called upon by his sovereign, he should have shrunk from his duty, if he had not yielded obedience to his commands. He was fully aware of the weight that was to be derived from the support of all the great interests that had given their countenance to the late administration; he was sensible of the splendid talents of the noble baron, and of the great energies that were necessary for the government in the present crisis; but he should have shrunk from his duty, if he had not been ready, at the call of his majesty, to come forward on a question, which he had thought necessary for upholding the dignity of the crown, for maintaining the interests of the country, and for supporting the public establishments, which he looked upon as intimately connected with the prosperity of the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Moira</member> <membercontribution>was adverse to the idea of being at issue with his sovereign, but a correct explanation of the transaction was rendered peculiarly necessary on account of the false and scandalous view of it which had been published by persons who must have had access to the minutes of the privy council, of which garbled extracts had been given in order to mislead the public. His noble friend had given that explanation with all that precision, justness, and delicacy, that might naturally have been expected from him. The noble secretary had laboured hard to prove that there had been a misconception on this point. This had not peen denied; but he had not touched on the pledges that had been required, and which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0142"/>
<col>253</col>
it was found impossible to give. The reservation was this: that under different circumstances his majesty's servants might think it their duty to bring the situation of the catholics again under his consideration, and surely it was not difficult to conceive an exigency in which this might be their duty. Occasions might occur in which this might be absolutely necessary for the salvation of the country; and his majesty's servants Would be guilty of a crime, if they should bind themselves by any pledge that should force them to conceal the situation of Ireland under all possible circumstances. This was not a spontaneous measure on the part of his majesty's servants. They could not, from a regard to their oaths, state all the pressure that compelled them to propose it. But it was impossible not to see what mischiefs might arise from the fomenting of religious differences in Ireland. The noble viscount near him said, that toleration did not extend to power. But his view of toleration extended a great deal further. His notion of toleration was, that no one ought unnecessarily to be deprived of the benefits of the constitution. The noble secretary talked of fundamental laws. It was true there must be fundamental laws, but at the same time it was part of their duty to modify those laws, so as to apply to circumstances as they might arise. The catholic population of Ireland ought to give at least 100,000 soldiers to our disposable force, and under the present circumstances, this was a motive certainly to open the army for them. Had he himself, or any other, laid the catholic petition on the table of that house, he would have said, that it would have been extremely impolitic at present to agitate the question; but the bill was a very different thing. It would have served, perhaps, to keep off this very petition; it would have afforded an useful vent for the population of Ireland, and removed many from the scene of discontent, while it would, in a great measure, have taken away the cause. It had been said, that the catholics were not to be entrusted with power; and yet you had entrusted them with power, for a catholic might be colonel of a regiment, and had all the opportunity of rendering the Men disaffected, and doing a great part of the mischief that was apprehended from him if he was so inclined. But there was no such inclination; and, in fact, those notions carried us back two centuries. Then, indeed, there might be grounds for apprehension, and these restrictions might be necessary. But now the
<col>254</col>
case was totally altered. This was the time to prevent the occurrence of the dangers that might result from a strict adherence to these disqualifications. When the danger actually came, the remedy would be far too late. He again disclaimed what was one of the ideas most foreign to his mind, that of being at issue with his sovereign. He was fully sensible of the many favours he had received at the hands of his sovereign; and was grateful for those acts of royal munificence of which he had been the object: he was most sincerely impressed with the conviction on his mind, that his majesty had acted as he had done from the most truly conscientious feeling as to the propriety of the case, when he was graciously pleased to express his disapprobation of the measure. But, at the same time, he must, in duty to his colleagues and himself, declare, that he was convinced that they discharged a most important duty to their country, to their sovereign, and to the constitution of the empire, as well as to their own character, when they withheld their names from a paper of such a nature as that which was then the object of their lordships discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville</member> <membercontribution>expressed his satisfaction that the discussion had been entered into, and he wished that every person from one end of the island to the other, should be informed of the true state of the question. An illustrious person, now no more (Mr. Pitt), had been alluded to; he joined from the very bottom of his heart in all the praises which had been bestowed on him; and so ardent was his attachment to the opinions of that great man, that he wished to make them the polar star of his life. He would now advert to a part of the conduct of that eminent character. When that distinguished man retired from office in 1800, he had an opinion, that the passing of the catholic question was indispensable. But, on weighing that question more maturely in retirement, and coupling it with the consideration of the honourable, unalterable, and conscientious repugnance of his sovereign, he altered that opinion, and determined never again to press his sovereign on a question, to which he was so conscientiously and invincibly averse. This determination was formed long before Mr. Pitt returned to office, and was communicated to his majesty long before that period, accompanied with Mr. Pitt's assurance to adhere to it equally, whether he should be in or out of office. On this principle Mr. Pitt came into office in 1804. He would ask the noble baron who had opened this
<image src="S1V0009P0I0143"/>
<col>255</col>
discussion, on the other side, whether, if the offer that had been made to him at that time to come into office with Mr. Pitt had been in other respects so agreeable as to have induced him to accept it, he would have insisted on the right of stating his opinions in favour of this catholic measure? The consideration of the question was at all times a consideration of expediency, which should be weighed maturely; but though the oath of office bound each of his majesty's counsellors to advise him to the best of his judgment and discretion in all such cases, there were other considerations also that ought to be included. The conduct of the late ministers, with respect to the bill they had brought forward, was subject to the imputation, that they had either brought it forward lightly, without sufficient occasion, or without sufficient grounds: or, if they had sufficient grounds in bringing it forward, they surrendered it in disregard of their oath of office, which binds them in all cases to give advice to the best of their judgment. As to the pledge demanded by his majesty that he should not be again troubled on this question, that arose from the reservation with which the measure then before parliament was given up. It was one thing to retain former opinions, as individual members of parliament, and another thing to state those opinions as members of parliament in the situation of ministers of the crown, with all the weight and influence annexed to that station. Was it for his majesty to expose himself to be constantly disturbed on a matter, with respect to the refusal of which he had already formed a clear, distinct, honourable, unalterable, and conscientious determination? He did not blame the late ministers for their adherence to their own opinions, but they ought to allow the sovereign whom they praised so much some right to maintain his opinion; and after their attempt to make the conditions that had been stated to him, it was not surprising that he wished to secure himself by requiring a corresponding pledge from them. If any of the disastrous cases which had been supposed with respect to Ireland should arise, it would be an awkward thing indeed if any of his majesty's ministers should be in the situation to get up and say to his majesty, all this has happened by your adhering to your own opinions, and not to my advice. He disliked those suppositions of disastrous cases, those prophecies of ill, thrown out on this occasion by noble lords on the other side, for those who made such prophecies had always a disposition to
<col>256</col>
realise them, or at least a wish to seet hem realised. If men in office held opinions different from those of their sovereign, he did not say they ought to give their opinions up; but if the sovereign could find other servants who would undertake to conduct the government, without requiring this sacrifice, he had certainly the right to appoint and make use of them. These persons might think, that by pursuing other conciliatory measures with respect to Ireland, (for this was not the only conciliatory measure, and none but conciliatory measures would be pursued) that part of the empire might be well and kindly governed without this sacrifice. From the whole of the statement made, he thought that the late ministers, upon their own shewing, had been properly dismissed, after that which they had proposed to his majesty had put him under the necessity of seeking relief from others, who thought, like him, that the measure under consideration ought not to be granted without an essential necessity. This proceeding of his majesty, and the acquiescence of those who were now his majesty's servants, was justified by the conduct of those, Who, though first holding the measure so essential as to be induced to bring it forward, afterwards thought it so little essential as to Concede it to the sovereign, at the same time that they made it a point of duty to maintain their own. opinions generally, independent of the sovereign's wishes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville </member>, <membercontribution>in answer to the question of the noble viscount, whether he had reserved to himself his own opinion, upon the subject of the Catholics, to act upon it, notwithstanding what he knew to be the opinion of his majesty upon that subject; answered, that he told Mr. Pitt, when solicited by him to take part in the administration before the last, that no consideration under Heaven should induce him to go into the service of the king, although he would join Mr. Pitt as soon as he would any other man &#x2014;that no consideration under Heaven should induce him to take part in any government upon earth, without reserving his own opinion upon this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>thought it unnecessary now to discuss either the bill lately before the other house, or the Catholic question; the real question was, the cause for the dismissal of his majesty's late ministers, and the situation in which his majesty's present ministers were placed on the catholic question. He was ready at any time to vindicate the conduct and the principles of himself and his
<image src="S1V0009P0I0144"/>
<col>257</col>
colleagues; and in answer to the question asked by the noble secretary of state, as to what occasion there was at this time to throw open the staff of the army, and the commissions of the navy, to that class of subjects? he would answer, that the awful and perilous situation of the empire rendered it necessary to conciliate the attachment, and unite the energies and affections of all classes of his majesty's subjects for our common defence. The noble secretary had said, it was not necessary, as the catholics already manned our regiments and fleets, and we should by this measure obtain no addition of their numbers; but little did that man know of human nature, or of soldiers feelings, who conceived that the spirit of an army was not to be materially affected by any proscription, or humiliating distinction attached to any particular class of casts or nations which composed it; or who imagined that it was no daunt to the ardour or skill of the soldier to tell him "you never can by any possibility rise to a high situation in the army." It was to the abandonment of this principle that we might impute the superior skill the French officers had so long maintained, and we should look to the effect of the same policy in the Russian armies, now fighting the battles of this country and of Europe against the common enemy, in Poland, where the Roman catholic religion was the established one. The highest posts in the Russian army were open to merit, regardless of sect; by which means the French could not tempt the Polish catholic to rebellion, because they had no advantage to offer in the way of rank, or preferment, which was not already open to him under his own government. However lightly other ministers had broken their pledges to the catholics, he and his colleagues were not in the habit of giving pledges without the intention of performing them: so neither could they reconcile themselves to the expedient policy now recommended by the noble viscount. They thought the bill proposed a measure at once much less grating to the royal feelings, and calculated to conciliate the catholics, and to prevent the discussion of the petition they were preparing to bring forward. The noble lord then proceeded to vindicate the conduct of himself and his colleagues, in declining to bind themselves by a pledge to refrain in future from giving any advice to his majesty which they thought it their duty to give, either upon this or upon any other topic, as a pledge violatory to the constitution, to their duty, and to their oaths; and he declared that, if
<col>258</col>
their successors had accepted their places under any such restriction, they had abandoned their duty, and with it the security of the most vulnerable part of the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p>The Earl of <i>Carnarvan</i> alluded to an observation, which had been made by some noble lord on the other side in the course of the debate. It had been said, if the bill was necessary, why should it have been withdrawn. In answer to this, he said, first, that, though he should now consider it to be as necessary as it was before, yet that something might have been fairly conceded to the wishes of the sovereign, and to his opinion as to the circumstances of the times. But still he would not hesitate to say, that if a promise such as had been alluded to were given, the persons who entered into such a compromise as involved the breach of a great constitutional principle, would deserve to lose their heads.</p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>explained, by denying that the present ministers had bound themselves by any such pledge: he said, if his majesty's late ministers thought their own opinions right, they did right to support them; and if they found those opinions positively resisted by his majesty, it was their duty to resign their situations.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Buckinghamshire rose</member> <membercontribution>to explain the principles that were in the contemplation of government, in 1801, respecting any further concessions to the catholics; which, he said, were nothing more than to pass a bill in the English parliament, adopting the same principle as the bill passed by the Irish parliament, for throwing open the subordinate ranks of the army, under that of staff officers, to catholics: and without which the Irish bill would have no operation out of Ireland. It could have no operation whatever in respect to the navy. Farther than this he never could consent to go. He was well aware, that the impossibility of rising to all the advantages of the military profession must considerably damp the ardour of an officer; and though he could see no great objection, nor mischief, from giving to Catholic officers staff-rank in any other country than Ireland, yet there he conceived it exceedingly dangerous, and nothing could ever shake his opinion upon this point. The Irish parliament never would have consented to such a measure, and this parliament would do well to pause before they ventured to carry concession so much farther than the parliament who well understood the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor (Erskine)</member> <membercontribution>said, he considered the subject of the Catholic Ques-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0145"/>
<col>259</col>
tion as completely irrelevant as any other whatever, to the late change in his majesty's councils, although it happened to be the subject which led to such a conjuncture. Although a member of the late government, he was decidedly adverse to the measure, and should not have advised it, because he did not see the political necessity for it which had induced the great majority of his colleagues to recommend it to his majesty, yet he thought they were highly commendable, and only doing their duty in giving his majesty such advice as they in their conscience thought just; as well as in declining to be bound by any pledge to refrain from giving to their sovereign upon this, or any subject, such advice as they conceived to be just. The firmness with which his majesty had maintained his own conscientious opinions, by resisting the bill in the extent to which it went, had also his respectful approbation; but he must say, that his colleagues did right in declining to be bound never again to advise the measure under any possible pressure of circumstances. At the moment when his majesty's late ministers relinquished the bill, in concession to his majesty's scruples, they stood in the same situation as upon their first accession to office. They knew his majesty's feelings. His majesty was aware that their sentiments were in favour of the concession. But their dereliction of the measure at that time, in deference to the royal opinion, was a tacit pledge that they would not again press it, unless under some extraordinary circumstances, which might render it more urgently necessary. Had it pleased his majesty then to await for this experience in the conduct of his ministers, and to see if they again endeavoured to press forward the measure, or submit it to parliament; and if they did it contrary to his majesty's wishes, they would have merited dismissal. The right of his majesty to change his ministers no man could deny; but to have remained in power, or accept office upon any such condition as the pledge alluded to, was, in his opinion, contrary to every principle of ministerial duty, and directly in violation of the constitution. Had the business ended with the abandonment of the bill, by the late administration, the Catholics would only have to say, they had been abandoned by their friends, and would have still cherished the hope of being more fortunate at some future period. But by the dismissal of those friends from the councils of their sovereign, for no other reason than their declining to pledge themselves never
<col>260</col>
again, under any circumstances, to allude to the question, or any thing connected with it upon his majesty's mind, they would be taught to consider, that the principle just declared by the noble earl, of never granting any farther concession to the catholics, was to be a part of the system of government: what the result of such conviction would be, he did not wish even to conjecture.&#x2014;The question for adjournment to Wednesday se'ennight was then put and agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION.] Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>moved that the house at its rising do adjourn to Wednesday sen'night. Upon which,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick rose </member>, <membercontribution>and spoke as follows: Sir, upon the motion which has just been made by the hon. gent. for an adjournment during the period which is usually allowed for a recess, at this season of the year, I trust it will not be thought irrelevant to the subject, if I take this opportunity of giving to the house that explanation of which I yesterday gave notice. It is of the utmost importance to myself and to my colleagues, that the circumstances which have led to the recent change of his majesty's ministers may be fully understood. It is of importance to the house, and to the public, that they may be enabled to form a proper estimate and opinion of the character and conduct of those persons to whom the administration of public affairs was so lately entrusted, and truly to appreciate all the circumstances of that situation, in which, in consequence of that change, the country is now placed. It is of importance to the house, in the decision of the question now stated from the chair, inasmuch as the propriety of an adjournment, of a longer or a shorter duration, may depend upon the necessity of adopting some measures, at the earliest possible period, to avert the conesequences of the extraordinary events which have taken place. To myself personally, every feeling both of duty and of honour renders it of the highest importance, that I should, as soon as possible, convince the house that my conduct has not been such as to make them repent of the kind indulgence which I have experienced from them. Undoubtedly, sir; every moment's delay, in which my conduct may be a matter of doubt with those
<col>262</col>
from whom I have received, together with my colleagues, such distinguished support, has been exceedingly painful to me; yet conceiving it to be my duty, I have abstained from saying any thing upon this subject till that moment arrived, when it was no longer necessary to be silent; when his majesty has declared his intention of placing the administration of affairs in other hands. I now therefore, having received his majesty's permission to do so, am at liberty to state, without a breach of duty, those circumstances which I am most anxious should be fully understood by the public. Desirous, however, as I may be to take the earliest possible moment to make this statement, and sensible that in justice to our own characters it can no longer be delayed, I confess I feel in common with those, who expressed that opinion last night, considerable regret that I am under the necessity of doing so in the absence of those persons, whose presence some may think requisite, to watch the accuracy of my statement. I am sure the hon. gent. (Mr. Sturges Bourne) who made some observations to this effect last night, will not charge me with intending to state any thing to the house which I do not myself believe to be strictly correct; the hon. gent. might, without any injurious suspicion of me, be of opinion, that the natural partiality with which men are apt to view their own conduct, required the presence of other persons, possessed of all the facts, and capable of correcting any unintentional errors, which this cause might produce. I am as anxious as any man that these persons should be present upon such an occasion, and I hope that this matter will yet be discussed at some future time, upon some motion proposed to this house, which may give an opportunity of making a restatement, if restatement should be necessary, but at all events of examining and sifting every part of the details which I am this day about to lay before you.&#x2014;Sir, it is neither in my nature nor in my habits to shrink from the examination of any man: but I felt myself reduced to this alternative, either to submit to have the public mind prejudiced by false reports and misrepresentations, supported by partial extracts from confidential papers; or in the absence of the persons alluded to to take this early opportunity of entering into the discussion. I am convinced that a fair, candid, and correct statement is the only antidote to such wilful misrepresentation; and that this is the only mode, consistent with my character,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0147"/>
<col>263</col>
and with my duty as a member of parliament, in which I could lay before the public a fair exposition of every part of my conduct. Under such circumstances it was impossible for me, in justice to myself and my colleagues&#x2014;nay, in justice to the public itself, which might be misled by such deception, it was impossible for me to suffer so long a period of time to elapse as might intervene before the new ministers could resume their seats in the house. Sir, in doing so however, upon the present occasion, their absence will have this effect, that I shall as much as possible confine myself to a mere statement of the facts, and abstain as far as I can from every thing that can provoke discussion; I shall state only what I conceive to be necessary for my own vindication, avoiding every thing like argument, and leaving all such points to that future discussion, which at an early day, after the holidays, I trust will take place; when an opportunity will be afforded of stating to the house every thing that may be material upon the subject.&#x2014;Sir, having premised thus much, I shall proceed to lay before the house the statement which I have promised. When the late administration was formed, there were included in it many members whose opinions and principles, with respect to what is called the Catholic Question, were generally known; they had been very recently manifested to the public, in the most authentic of all ways, by their speeches and their votes in parliament. I am sure there did not exist in any quarter an expectation or suspicion that those persons, whose characters were so well known, could be induced, for the sake of office or emolument, to abandon any of the opinions and principles which they had so solemnly expressed and avowed. In point of fact, no condition inconsistent with the freest exercise of their judgment was proposed to them, nor did they come into the government subject to any such stipulation, which if it had been exacted from them, they would have found it incumbent upon them, in honour and in duty, then, as now, to decline. At the same time, however, that I state this with respect to their opinions and principles, I will not attempt to deny, that great difficulties were known to stand in the way of further concessions to the catholics of England and Ireland. And as his majesty's late ministers came into administration totally unfettered upon all subjects, I can speak for every individual among them, that they had a sincere and anxious desire, while they
<col>264</col>
conducted the government in conformity to their own principles, and with the best wishes for the interests of the state, to avoid, if possible, every thing that was repugnant to any of those feelings and opinions, which, upon every motive of duty, affection, and attachment, they were most bound to respect. Sir, these were the principles upon which those who composed the last administration came into power: their opinions upon the catholic question were well known; but they hoped, by a prudent, lenient, and conciliatory system of government, to keep that question for some time at rest: and, for a considerable period, their hopes and expectations were flattered with every appearance of success. However sir, towards the latter end of the last year, there did occur circumstances in the west of Ireland, which increased all the anxiety, with which, from their first introduction to office, they had directed their attention to that country: a most valuable, but, I am afraid I must add, the most vulnerable part of the British dominions. The disturbances, which towards the end of last year reigned in the west, engaged our most anxious deliberations, and although we were urged by many persons, who are fonder of the policy of force than I am, to resort to measures of extraordinary severity; although, on the second day<sup>*</sup> of the present session, we were eagerly pressed by an hon. and learned gent., who was impatient for rigour, and could not wait for the determination of his majesty's ministers; yet, to effect the reduction of that spirit which prevailed in Ireland, we determined
<quote><sup>*</sup>Upon the report of the Address, 20th December last, Mr. Perceval, among other observations, urged these: "No mention had been made of the state of Ireland. He trusted that this silence might be ascribed to the total want of foundation for the alarming rumours that had reached this country. Ministers must unquestionably be the judges how far the usual prerogatives of the crown were sufficient to suppress insurrection or rebellion, in whatever quarter it might appear; the decision rested with them: he only begged them to consider, that the protraction of the necessary day of punishment was not mercy; and the delay which allowed insurrection to proceed, until it became impossible to quell it without a considerable shedding of blood, was not kindness. He hoped that the omission of any notice of the situation of the sister island, was occasioned by the absence of any necessity for an extraordinary exertion of the law. Should such a necessity unfortunately arise, and should ministers call on the house for an enlargement of the executive power, he could assure them that they should meet with no opposition on his part to any proper measure of vigour, which they might think it expedient to propose,"&#x2014; See vol. s, p. 87.</quote>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0148"/>
<col>265</col>
to confide in an active exertion of the known powers of the law; and, thank God, our hopes in this respect were realized, without recurring to those severities, which less politic and more intemperate advisers had wished to recommend. But, sir, after these occurrences, it became necessary to look more immediately to measures, that might tend to conciliate and tranquillize that country. Several measures were in contemplation, and, among them that which I had the honour of lately introducing into this house appeared to be one of the most obvious. It seemed calculated to prove highly beneficial to the empire at large, as well as to Ireland itself. It was expected to afford the means of recruiting our naval and military force, so necessary at the present moment to be carried to the utmost extent, by facilitating the introduction of those persons into the service, who are at present in a great measure excluded, by What I must call the ill-understood policy of the existing laws. The bill which I brought in for this purpose has been improperly termed the Catholic bill; for it included dissenters from the established church of every description. We certainly expected from it that it would contribute essentially to the tranquillity of Ireland, by holding out to the gentlemen of that country the prospect of rising in the army and navy, and thus diffusing motives of attachment towards this country among the people in general: at the same time that it would afford a vent to the superabundant population, and draw from the very sources of discontent the means of strength and security. These were the motives which induced the king's ministers to propose that measure. I do not know that it is necessary for me to state, and yet the arts which have been practised may render it useful to state, that, in bringing forward this measure, their intention was not to invade but to strengthen the securities of the established church itself. If I estimate rightly in what those securities consist, I think they are interwoven with the security and existence of the empire. Can the one be safe if the other be in danger? And are not the necessary means for the defence of the empire, the best security for its religious establishments? If ever Ireland should be exposed (which God avert!) to a successful invasion of the enemy, I call upon those who accuse us of endangering the establishments, to reflect what must then be the fate of our church and the protestant religion.&#x2014; Sir, while this measure was under consideration, accounts were re-
<col>266</col>
ceived from Ireland, transmitted by the lord lieutenant (dated 4th Feb.), of a disposition manifested by the catholics to prosecute, by a petition to parliament, those claims, which they had so recently urged in a former session. Notwithstanding the known opinions which I and some of my colleagues hold in favour of those claims, we were persuaded, that the agitation of the question at this time was not likely to be attended with advantage; and so far as our private advice and influence could extend, it was used to dissuade the catholics from the attempt. The knowledge, however, of their intention, was an additional inducement in recommending the measure which we had already in contemplation. We hoped, though it was offered in no view of compromise, that it might prevent the agitation of that very question, by affording satisfaction to the catholics of Ireland in general; at the same time that we considered it as recommended by every principle of policy. We trusted that this limited measure of concession might be brought forward without encountering those objections, which were involved in the general question of what is commonly called emancipation. In reverting to the Irish act of parliament, passed in the year 1793, and observing the incongruity which subsists in the law of the united kingdom, we could not overlook the pledge explicitly given at that time by the lord chancellor of Ireland, and by the secretary of Ireland (lord Clare and lord Buckinghamshire), that a similar law, to allow the admission of catholics both into the army and navy, should be introduced in England. This pledge to the catholics is recorded in the secretary of state's office, in a dispatch from Mr. Hobart, now lord Buckinghamshire. We considered it, therefore, not more a measure of general policy than an act of good faith and consistency; and we did hope, that upon all these grounds we should be able to obtain for them that boon which had been promised them upon a former occasion, under the authority of government, and that the proposal would meet with that general approbation from all parties, to which it seemed to us so well entitled. It was upon all these grounds proposed to his majesty, and a detailed dispatch was written and sent to the lord lieutenant of Ireland (a document which I wish I could lay before the house upon the present occasion) stating much better than I have been stating them, all the reasons which induced us to propose this measure&#x2014;the draft of this dispatch was previously sent, accompanied
<image src="S1V0009P0I0149"/>
<col>267</col>
by a cabinet minute (dated 9th February), to his majesty. To that first proposal his majesty expressed a strong dissent; and upon receiving the answer from his majesty, the cabinet again deliberated upon it, and again made a respectful representation (dated 10th February) to his majesty, as to the grounds upon which they thought it expedient as a point of general policy, principle, and good faith. To that representation came back an answer from his majesty, expressing still considerable reluctance, but, however, signifying his consent. I say, Sir, that that answer conveyed a reluctant, but a positive assent. Under that high sanction and authority the dispatch was sent to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, and soon after a meeting was held of the catholics, with Mr. Elliot, the principal secretary, and the lord chancellor, in which it was stated (abstaining from every thing that related to the petition), that this measure was to be introduced into the Mutiny bill.&#x2014;Some discussion arose upon it, and a question was put to Mr. Elliot by one of the catholic deputies, Mr. O'Connor, whether the proposed measure went the length of including the admission of catholics into all ranks of the army, or whether it was to be limited by the restrictions of the Irish act. Mr. Elliot's answer was, in the words of the dispatch, that it was proposed to enable his majesty to confer on any of his subjects any military commission whatever. There can be no question, however, that Mr. Elliot had conceived doubts as to the extent of the measure, that he expressed himself doubtfully, and that his answer was reported as doubtful to a meeting of the catholics; but it was at the same time declared by the deputies who attended this conference, that they understood it to be the intention of government, that staff appointments in the army, which had been excepted in the Irish act, should be opened to them. The dispatches, stating what had passed at these meetings, the question put, and the answer given with respect to the extent of the measure, as well as the understanding which the catholics had conceived of it, Were regularly submitted to his majesty; and no dissatisfaction or uneasiness was expressed in consequence of what was thus brought under his view. I am bound to say, however, that it has since appeared that the measure had not been distinctly understood; not only his majesty, but some members of the cabinet, had not been fully aware of its extent; and I must confess, that I had not myself sufficiently
<col>268</col>
attended to the distinction between it and the Irish act. When this appeared, it became the subject of a new deliberation, in which an objection was stated by a respectable member of the cabinet (the lord president) to any concession beyond the Irish act. A majority, however, concurred in recommending the measure in the form in which it was afterwards introduced; but as doubts had arisen, and an apprehension was entertained that it might have been misunderstood by his majesty, it was determined to bring the matter distinctly under his royal observation, by a second dispatch to the lord lieutenant, clearly stating its full extent.&#x2014;And here I must state, that some distinctions ought to be taken between the duties of ministers and those of private members of parliament. I conceive that a minister may, as an individual member of parliament, introduce measures for which the authority of government is not at all pledged; I could adduce instances of this in the administration of the late Mr. Pitt, The house will at once recollect the motion for a reform in parliament, and that for the abolition of the slave trade: both these motions were introduced by him as an individual member of parliament, without the responsibility of government being attached to them. Sir, during the short period that I have had the honour of holding a situation under his majesty, I and my noble colleague have, in the same manner, brought forward successfully the measure of the abolition of the slave trade, to which I shall look with satisfaction for the remainder of my days. But, sir, where a measure arising out of various causes which have engaged the attention of his majesty's confidential servants, is to be brought forward with the authority of government, the measure itself, as well as the case to which it applies, ought undoubtedly to be first submitted to his majesty. I certainly feel that I ought not to have introduced a measure of this description without the sanction of that authority; and I should think myself reprehensible in the highest degree, and deserving all the censure that is endeavoured to be cast upon me, if I had proposed this bill to parliament without believing that I had his majesty's consent.&#x2014;Sir, I have stated that a doubt arose as to the understanding of the extent of this bill; it was therefore determined (lord Spencer at that time being absent on account of his health) that I should write a dispatch to the lord lieutenant, enclosing the clauses intended to be introduced into the Mutiny bill, stating distinctly that they were
<image src="S1V0009P0I0150"/>
<col>269</col>
in conformity with the general words of the dispatch which had been sent on the 12th of February last, marking expressly that the catholics were to be admitted to hold any commission or appointment whatever; and observing that a confirmation was thus given of Mr. Elliot's answer to the catholic deputies. This dispatch, so expressed for the purpose of removing all doubts, and inclosing, as I have already stated, the intended clauses, was sent down by me, on Monday night, the 2d of March, to his majesty. This dispatch, having been perused by his majesty, came back from Windsor on the following morning, without a word of comment or objection; and with this sanction I acted, as in the course of my official business I had been uniformly accustomed to do &#x2014;I immediately forwarded it to the lord lieutenant &#x2014;Sir, at this time the committee on the Mutiny bill was, I believe, appointed for the Wednesday; but objections had been started to the enactment of the proposed measure by clauses in that bill: it was therefore, upon reconsideration, determined to introduce a separate bill. On Wednesday, the 4th of March, the dispatch which I have just mentioned having been previously sent to the lord lieutenant, I attended at the levee at St. James's, and had an audience with his majesty upon the business of my office; after that was over his majesty was graciously pleased to ask me what was the business appointed for that day in the house. I stated to his majesty that the committee on the Mutiny bill stood as the order of the day, and explained to him the nature of the change that had taken place in the mode of proceeding, and the reasons which had induced the introduction of a separate bill: the king afterwards asked me whether the separate bill, intended to be brought forward was not the same as the Irish act of parliament? I stated to him the circumstances in which they differed to which I added, that I apprehended it had been already explained to his majesty in the last dispatch which had been submitted to him. I also stated the reasons why I conceived the measure, in the extent to which it was intended to be carried, to be of the utmost importance to the welfare and security of the government of the country. And here, sir, I must acknowledge, that his majesty, upon that occasion, did express a general dislike and disapprobation of the measure. I mean to state every thing frankly, but I did understand that conversation to conclude by words giving a consent, a reluctant consent, I admit; or,
<col>270</col>
perhaps, it would be more correctly stated as not withdrawing the consent which had been originally given. I conceived, therefore, that I still had sufficient authority, as a member of the government, for the introduction of the bill. I stated to my lord Grenville, immediately on coming out of the closet, what had passed there; his opinion upon that statement was the same as mine, and we were confirmed in our belief that his majesty did not intend to signify any absolute objection to the introduction of the bill, from the total silence which he observed upon this subject in the audience which lord Grenville afterwards had. His majesty did not say one word to lord Grenville, the leading member of the administration, upon a measure which, it now appears, had the misfortune of being exposed to his most decided opposition. Under these impressions, on the next day, or the day after, I introduced the bill into parliament: the motives which had produced it, the extent to which it went, were fully explained; not only were the arguments on which those persons relied who had proposed the measure, stated at some length, but the objections to them were urged with no inconsiderable vehemence. We know, sir, that debates in this house, though they cannot consistently with our orders be published, do find their way out of doors, and attract, particularly on any interesting subject, general observation. They, probably, do not excite the weakest interest in those whose concern for the public welfare is the greatest. But, sir, though this degree of publicity was now given to the measure, and though it could not be misunderstood, during a whole week which subsequently elapsed, I remained in Complete ignorance, and without the slightest suspicion of the very serious, and, as it has appeared, insurmountable objections, which have since been made to it. Objections had, undoubtedly, been stated by one of my colleagues (lord Sidmouth), for whom I have great respect, upon the first clearing up of the misunderstanding which had prevailed with respect to the extent of the bill these objections, during the interval of which I have been speaking, assumed a more decided form, and he offered his resignation in consequence of them; but though, after the introduction of the bill, I had communication with his majesty in the course of my official duty on other subjects, I had no reason till the Wednesday following, when I was absent both from this house and front my usual attendance on his majesty, on ac
<image src="S1V0009P0I0151"/>
<col>271</col>
count of the death of a near relation, to believe that any extension whatever of the proposed measure, beyond the provisions of the Irish act, had been found absolutely irreconcilable with his principles and his feelings. On that day (Wednesday, March the 11th), his majesty stated to lord Grenville his decided objection, and referred, as having before signified this objection, to the conversation with which he had honoured me on the preceding Wednesday. I certainly had not so understood his majesty. If I had, I need not say that I should have found myself bound by every motive of interest and duty to submit so important a circumstance to the consideration of my colleagues before I moved for leave to bring in the bill. But, sir, it would have been most unbecoming in me, even if I could have entertained such a suspicion, to insinuate a doubt of the royal word. We were convinced that the king had been misunderstood by me, and as I had been placed in the unfortunate situation of introducing the bill under this misapprehension, I thought it my duty to suspend any further proceedings upon it, till I should have had an opportunity of explaining to his majesty the circumstances of my conduct. I accordingly on the night of Thursday the 12th proposed to the house to postpone the second reading of the bill to a farther day, and at the same time requested an audience of his majesty, which he was graciously pleased to honour me with on the following morning. Upon laying before his majesty the reasons which had induced me to believe that I was not as his minister acting in opposition to his royal pleasure; he was pleased to express his conviction that what had happened had arisen from an erroneous conception on my part, but acquitted me most graciously, but most unequivocally, of any intentional disregard of his opinions. From that moment it became a matter of the most anxious consideration to his majesty's ministers how they might best repair the effects of the misunderstanding which had taken place; they immediately applied their attention to the means of reducing the new bill to the standard of the Irish act, in the hope that they might be able still to carry it forward as an useful public measure under the sanction of his majesty's consent. But when we came to examine the objections that had been made to it, they were found to affect the measure in so considerable a degree, that, upon a full consideration of the subject, we were convinced there could be no hope of correcting the bill in such a man-
<col>272</col>
ner as to relieve it from the objections that prevailed against it, and at the same time leave it in a state in which it would be likely to attain those ends which his majesty's late ministers had in view when it was originally proposed.&#x2014;In this situation, Sir, after anxiously weighing all the circumstances of the case, we determined&#x2014;(I should here explain that the representations which were made in this stage of the proceedings were confined to those members of the cabinet who had concurred in opinion upon the measure to its full extent,) we determined, however painful the sacrifice might personally be, to abandon the bill altogether. It was, I say, a most painful sacrifice of personal feeling to public duty; a sacrifice which nothing short of a conviction that the measure had been introduced under a misunderstanding into this house, could have induced me to make; a sacrifice dictated only by a desire of doing what, under circumstances of such embarrassment, we conceived, after the most anxious deliberation, to be most consistent with our respect to our sovereign, and with the obligations imposed on us in the double capacity of members of the administration and of the legislature. In this situation we determined to make a sacrifice, which in any case where personal feelings and public duties come in competition with each other, I hope I shall never hesitate to make. It was, however, I repeat, a great and painful sacrifice; and in making it, it was necessary that we should take care not to place ourselves in a situation in which we might be made incapable of rendering hereafter any useful service to the public. The circumstances which occurred rendered the measures to be taken, with a view to the future security and peace of Ireland, a consideration of greater delicacy and difficulty than ever. Our public duty and our private honour made it indispensable that we should be free and unfettered on this point of our necessary deliberations. Circumstances had occurred in an early period of these transactions, and had been more strongly manifested during this latter period of the discussion, which implied a restriction on this important subject; and we found it necessary not only to reserve to ourselves the power of explaining to parliament our conduct with respect to the bill we had consented to withdraw; and of declaring in parliament individually the opinions which we hold with respect to the catholic claims, in the possible event of a discussion of their petition; but also to state it as essential to our own characters, as
<image src="S1V0009P0I0152"/>
<col>273</col>
well as to the public interest, that the deference which we had felt it our duty to shew, on this occasion, to the opinions and feelings expressed by his majesty, should not be understood as restraining us from submitting, from time to time, as it was our duty, for his Majesty's decision, such measures respecting that part of the united kingdom, as the course of circumstances should appear to require; accompanied with an humble assurance, that in discharging that and every other part of our duty, so long as his majesty should think fit to honour us with his confidence, nothing should be omitted on our part, which could best testify our invariable and respectful attachment to his majesty, and our sincere and anxious concern for his majesty's personal ease and comfort, and for the prosperity and honour of his majesty's government. This part of our proceeding has been most improperly misrepresented to the public. It has been stated in that mutilated publication to which 1 have already alluded as if we had reserved to ourselves the power of bringing this particular measure again before parliament; and the important words <i>"for your majesty's decision,"</i> as well as the concluding paragraphs, are in that extract omitted, purposely to give a false colour to the proceeding. Not only was the respectful statement which we made in writing to his majesty, accompanied with our declaration of our sincere and anxious desire to consult, on all occasions, his majesty's personal ease and comfort; but it was distinctly stated personally, both by my lord Grenville and myself, that it would be our constant wish and endeavour to keep from him, as much as possible, all subjects which might be distressing to his mind. I appeal then with confidence to the house, on the purity of the motives by which we were actuated, on the deference and respect shewn, to the utmost limit of our public duty, to his majesty's personal feelings and opinions.&#x2014;But was it necessary to make the reserve which I have stated, and which, in consequence, of the foullest misrepresentation, has been the object of such severe censure? I beg the house to consider the situation in which we were placed. The bill already introduced, and received with apparent favour by the house, was to be withdrawn. Was it not necessary that, in withdrawing it, I should, in justice to myself, endeavour to shew that it had not been lightly and wantonly proposed? Could I do so without some reference to the arguments, by which I had originally supported it, and which I will not now repeat? Was
<col>274</col>
it not necessary then that I should be allowed to declare the grounds upon which an opinion, that I could not renounce, had been formed? But this, it is said, was placing my opinion in opposition to that of my royal master, and exposing him to any odium which might attach on a personal opposition to the measure. I will not examine this charge as applicable to a member of parliament; I will consider it only as affecting the conduct of the king's minister: and in this latter view I think it may be admitted, that under the particular circumstances of the case, after the prejudice and alarm which had been excited, and with a view to the consequences likely to arise from a public agitation of the question, public reasons, in no degree reflecting on his majesty, might have been assigned for withdrawing the bill; at the same time that I might, with all the respect due from a minister of the crown, and with the freedom of a member of parliament, have endeavoured to explain to the satisfaction of the house the reasons which had influenced my conduct Sir, I do not believe that there is one member of right feeling in the house, who will deny that this course was necessary to the support of my consistency and honour; and I feel equally confident in asserting, that it was in no degree inconsistent with my duty as a minister of the crown. But it was necessary that we should look beyond the conduct to be pursued in withdrawing the bill. The Catholic petition, it now seemed certain, would be sent over to parliament. It was to be apprehended, that the discussion upon it would be urged with increased rather than diminished earnestness, in consequence of the disappointment likely to be felt from the failure of the bill which had been proposed. With this prospect before us, what were we to do? Were we to determine to renounce our former opinions? Were we, which would have been no less disgraceful, to observe the expected discussion in perfect silence? No, Sir; neither of these things could, I think, be expected of us. There was only then a third line of conduct to which we could look, and that was a free declaration of our sentiments on this important question. Those of his majesty's ministers who agreed in general on this important question might adopt a different line of conduct, with respect to any discussion on the petition. Some might think themselves acting best for the general interest by supporting a previous question; others might feel themselves bound to support the prayer of the petition
<image src="S1V0009P0I0153"/>
<col>275</col>
if urged in proper and respectful terms. But a free declaration of their opinions was equally necessary from all; and with this necessity before us, I ask the house, Whether we could, in justice to ourselves, or in fairness to his majesty, in the situation to which things were then brought, omit humbly submitting to him the view we entertained of the conduct which it would be requisite for us to hold. If a doubt is entertained upon this question, let me put it the other way. Suppose that the bill had been abandoned after the discussion, and in the manner that I have stated. Suppose, that, having so engaged to abandon it, we had gone to the two houses of parliament, and without any previous intimation to his majesty, both in withdrawing the bill, and afterwards on the introduction of the petition, supported the opinions upon the Catholic question which we are known to hold. If we had done this, I desire to know what would have been the charge made against us, by those who now accuse us of an unfair and disrespectful proceeding towards that sovereign, whom, on account of his high situation and his personal virtues, we are equally bound to revere.&#x2014;We took therefore that course which appeared to us to be most fair and honourable. Our reasons were respectfully stated to his majesty, and we claimed a right to pronounce our opinions in parliament on the occasions already stated, and also to submit for his majesty's decision, from time to time, such advice respecting Ireland, as the course of circumstances and the interests of the empire should require. This I am sure, in point of fairness, cannot be reprehended; and it was equally supported by motives of personal respect and public duty to our sovereign and to our country.&#x2014;A minute written with this view, and expressed in the most respectful language, was accordingly sent to his majesty. The royal answer expressed satisfaction at our determination to withdraw the bill, in deference to the king's opinions. It expressed some,dissatisfaction, that we should feel it necessary as individuals to express our opinions both on withdrawing the bill, and in any discussion which might take place on the petition. But the latter part of our statement it required us absolutely to withdraw, declaring that his majesty could never consent to any concessions to the catholics which we might in future propose to him; and demanding from us a positive assurance, which, as explained by the whole context of what was re-
<col>276</col>
quired of us, went not only to the question of concessions to the catholics, but to all measures connected with it.&#x2014;Sir, I am fully convinced that the motives and opinions, as far as they were personal motives and opinions, which dictated that demand on the part of his majesty, were of the purest nature. I have been but a short time in the service of his majesty; but I have had many opportunities of observing his gracious and benevolent intentions towards his people, of his affection for them, and his desire to promote their happiness and welfare. As far as he was personally concerned (I say nothing of those who may have advised him), as far as his majesty was personally concerned, I am sure be was actuated by the most conscientious motives, and the most honourable feelings. But with such a requisition, sir, we found it impossible to comply, consistently with any idea we entertained of duty or of honour. We felt it incumbent on us most respectfully and humbly, but most explicitly, to represent to his majesty, that those intrusted with administration were bound by every obligation to submit to his majesty, without reserve, the best advice they could frame, to meet the various exigencies and dangers of the times; and that the present formidable situation of Ireland required a repeated consideration of every fresh circumstance that might occur. We submitted, that in forbearing to urge any farther, while we continued in his majesty's service, the measure that had been proposed to parliament, we had gone to the utmost limits of our public duty; that we considered it would be, criminal in us to bind ourselves to withhold from his majesty, under all the circumstances that might arise, the counsels that might appear to us indispensably necessary; and that it was not possible for us, consistently with our sense of our obligations as the king's sworn counsellors, to give assurances which would impose upon us a restraint, incompatible with the faithful discharge of our most important duty. The consequence was, that the next day, his majesty, certainly with the most gracious and kind expressions with regard to every other part of our conduct, communicated to us his intention to look out for other ministers. On the day after, we heard that other persons; not then in the number of his majesty's servants, had been sent for; and I was authorised a few days afterwards, in consequence of a request which I made, to declare to the house that it was his majesty's intention to form a

<col>277</col>
New Administration, On Tuesday last, his majesty signified to us his pleasure, that should, on the following day, deliver up our seals of office; we accordingly did so &#x2014; This, sir, is the history of the whole transaction. I have not referred to any papers to support my statement but I do wish, and am extremely anxious, that all the documents that can be furnished may meet the public eye not in an improper mutilated, or partial state. I shall be most happy, if his majesty is graciously pleased to give permission to his new servants to produce every paper hat has passed upon the subject, in order that they may undergo the fullest examination in this house. I trust it will appear from those papers, that the statement I have made is correct in all its parts; and if that statement be correct, that the house will be satisfied upon the following points; first, that it was not without strong inducements of public interest that we proposed this measure originally to his majesty; secondly, that whatever misunderstanding may unfortunately have arisen, we did not propose it to parliament without a firm persuasion that it had his majesty's sanction; thirdly, that when that misunderstanding was discovered, we went to the utmost limits of our duty in conceding the measure upon that misunderstanding had arisen; and, fourthly, that in addition to that concession, under the peculiar circumstances in which we were placed, the respectful request that we submitted to his majesty, to allow us the liberty to explain our opinions and conduct upon the particular measure, accompanied, as it was, by a declaration of our wish to consult his personal ease and comfort, was not wantonly pressed upon his majesty, but from motives of duty find respect; arid that the reserve we made as to the freedom of our future advice, was indispensable to our character and situation, as ministers of the crown and as servants of the public &#x2014;These, sir, are therefore the points which I wish the house to understand, This statement, which, though at some length, is after all perhaps too cursorily given, is that which I have wished to lay before the house and the public. I shall be ready now, or at any future time, to go more fully into it whenever it shall be required of me.&#x2014;Sir, I shall conclude by declaring that I feel no disposition to complain. I am sure, as I have already stated, that there can be but one feeling and one opinion of the gracious Kindness of his majesty, with respect to
<col>278</col>
every class and description of his subjects; and so far from being a party to join in any thing that might lessen that attaohment due to a virtuous sovereign from an affectionate and grateful people, no man can be more anxious than I am to promote and secure it to the utmost of my power. I should indeed be most ungrateful it I could be actuated by a different feeling; for I have had, during the short period of my services, repeated marks of his majesty's royal approbation; and I have the comfort and satisfaction, in retiring from office, to be able to state, upon the authority of his majesty's own gracious assurance, that, till this difference occurred, his majesty has been satisfied, that however deficient I may have been in ability, I have constantly endeavoured, diligently and faithfully, to discharge my duty to him and to the public.&#x2014;Sir, I stated in the outset that I would abstain from every thing like argument upon the subject. Upon the subject of the assurance required of us, I have, therefore, without discussing it as to its principle or its tendency, stated little more, than that I felt it to be a requisition, to which I could not subscribe consistently with my honour or my duty. I should indeed think it not only unconstitutional but highly criminal in any minister who could accept of or retain power subject to such a restraint. With that opinion, therefore, his majesty's late ministers were compelled respectfully but decidedly to declare, that it was a stipulation which they could not enter into, without forfeiting their own esteem, and inasmuch as it must fetter and confine them in the exercise of their judgments, on those points-on which they ought to be most free, without depriving them of the character of useful and honourable servants to their king and their country &#x2014;Here, sir, I shall for the present leave my conduct to the candid consideration of the house and or the public. I should be anxious, however, if any thing should arise out of this that could induce any gentleman to think it a proper subject fir a motion, when those persons return to their seats, whose presence at the discussion is considered to be necessary, that the question should be taken up with as little delay as possible. I am therefore desirous that the adjournment should be short and I had hoped that Monday se'nnight, by which day the new writs may with ease be returned, would have been proposed for our meeting again; but the

<col>279</col>
difference of two days is so small, that I do I not feel disposed to press it.

<p><member>General Loftus rose</member> <membercontribution>to make two observations on what had fallen front the noble lord (Howick) first, in respect to the act of 1793, and what passed at that time in Ireland. The noble lord said that the Government of that day had pledged itself to carry into effect the boon granted to the Irish Catholics to England. The noble lord was mistaken; something only was held out, that possibly this boon might at a future day he extended to Great Britain, nothing more; there was no pledge whatever Besides, all that was granted to the Irish Catholics was the holding commissions in the army to a certain rank. But the noble lord's proposition went much farther; it extended to the highest ranks in the army&#x2014;commander in chief, masters general of the
<col>280</col>
ordnance, generals on the staff; these were not in the Irish act of 1793&#x2014;He must make another observation on what the noble lord advanced in respect to the state of Ireland; for the noble lord gave as a reason for the introducing the catholic bill, the alarming state of Ireland. The hon. general said he had often heard allusions made by gentlemen now on that side of the house, in respect to the state of Ireland, allusions which tended more to inflame the public mind, and to inculcate fancied notions of distress, which in fact did not exist, rather than to soften or relieve any distress, if it had existed. He wished, before gentlemen quitted that house for the holidays, that they should know the real situation of the great body of the people in Ireland, for the fact was, they were already emancipated; the peasantry, the lower class&#x2014;nay the middle classes, were in the same state of that description of persons in England; there was ant an iota of difference between the richest members tenants, of that house and his own or any gentleman's tenants in Ireland: they had 10s. freeholds; could vote for members of parliament; could sit on Juries; could hold the commission of the peace, and every office (except those of the lord chancellor and the Judges, commander in chief, and general on the staff) was open to the Irish at this moment. So that in fact, the great body of the people had nothing to complain of, nothing to gain by the noble lord's measure, nor did they care or think about it. These were matters of fact not generally understood or known by the English gentlemen, and therefore he thought it right that the house should not separate without these observations.&#x2014;It was then ordered that the House should at its rising adjourn to Wednesday the 8th of April.</membercontribution></p>

<col>283</col>
the basis of our laws and liberties; and that the oaths and declarations provided in that bill, and preceding and subsequent acts of parliament, are not more than sufficient for the preservation of the church establishment against the attempts of those, whose principles ever have been, and ever must remain, in direct hostility to it; and that the petitioners, instructed by all experience, apprehend that those who have ever abused power when they have possessed it, to the purposes of founding their own dominion on the destruction of the civil and religious liberties of mankind, and the true principles of Christian toleration, would be inclined, if circumstances permitted, to pursue the same conduct; and that placing military trusts and commands in the hands of persons so disposed, would enable them to extort any other concession they might be induced to demand, and furnish them with a powerful instrument to carry on their projects with effect, to the utter ruin of our happy constitution in church and state, which must stand or fall together; and therefore praying, that the above-mentioned bill may not pans into a law, and that the house, in its wisdom, will be pleased to maintain and preserve inviolate those laws, which experience has proved to be the best safeguards of our national happiness and security, and under Divine Providence, the firmest support of the title of our beloved monarch and his august family to the throne of this united kingdom."&#x2014;Ordered to lie upon the table.&#x2014; &#x2014;Lord Folkestone presented a petition from Wm. Drake, setting forth, "That the petitioner, to his extreme grief and mortification, was declared by the house to have been guilty of wilful falsehood and gross prevarication in the evidence given by him before the house, on a Petition of James Paull, esq. relative to the Westminster election, and was ther upon by the order of the house, on the 18th of March, committed to Newgate, where he has ever since remained; and that it appears, from returns made to the house, that the petitioner for many years served in his majesty's navy, and was wounded in such service, so as to occasion the loss of his leg, and that the petitioner has a wife and child, altogether dependant on him for support, who, in consequence of his imprisonment, are in great distress; and the death of his father since his imprisonment has been productive of additional calamity to him; and that the petitioner is most sincerely sorry at having incurred the displeasure of the house, and
<col>284</col>
intreats the clemency of the house to be extended towards him and his family, who, if his imprisonment should be continued, will be in a state truly deplorable; and therefore praying, that the house will be pleased to take his situation into its consideration, and to order that he may be discharged from his confinement, or to grant to him such other relief as in its humanity it shall think fit."&#x2014;The petition having been read, the Speaker said it was his duty to call the attention of the house to the substance of this petition. It had been hitherto customary when persons committed under such circumstances as those in which the petitioner stood, solicited from that house an exercise of its benevolence in their favour, by ordering their liberation, that they should at least confess the crime for which they stood committed, thereby acknowledging the justice of the sentence, and expressing their contrition, But the petition just now read contained no such acknowledgment&#x2014;The petition was allowed to remain on the table, without any further observation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION.] Mr. Brand rose</member> <membercontribution>for the purpose of bringing forward his promised motion, and addressed the house as follows:&#x2014;I rise, sir, to submit to the house a few observations on a subject of great national importance, and involving in it questions of the most serious constitutional consideration. And in doing so, sir, I cannot help expressing my sincere regret that a duty of such moment had not devolved upon some member more competent to discharge it than the humble individual who in his zeal for the constitution, was heedless of the difficulties his inferiority must in such an undertaking have to contend against. But, sir, however inadequate I may prove, I have to conjure the house not to attribute the feebleness of the advocate to the weakness of the cause, but rather be disposed to conclude that, as a becoming sense of the greatness of the question and of the tribunal fills me with dismay, so should the indulgence of this house contribute to remove it. Sir, I could have wished to have staid those foul calumnies that presumed with equal ignorance and malice to prejudge and to condemn the motives that influenced the conduct of his majesty's late servants, so far as that conduct related to the unfortunate misunderstanding that led to their dismissal; and this, sir, not upon the principle of preferring any one ministry, or of adhering to any one party, but upon the great and unshaken conviction, that the unrestricted pro-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0158"/>
<col>285</col>
pagation of such slanders, however gross or false, tend in an alarming degree to vitiate the public mind, and thus to assail political integrity in its very source; for they have but empty notions of our greatness as a people, who do not understand that public virtue is national security. I repeat, therefore, sir, that I wish such slanders had been staid, at least until the ingenuous, manly, and luminous statement of the noble lord (Howick) had gone abroad, and rendered them contemptible and harmless. Sir, that statement enabled me to form a clear and satisfactory opinion of the conduct of the late ministers, immediately previous to their departure from power; and, as I consider the question upon that part of their conduct as involving great constitutional principles, I have foregone my original intention of going at large into the general merits of their administration; and shall confine myself to a brief consideration of that conduct which has been the subject of so much discussion and to the principles by which it appears to have been regulated. I presume then, sir, I will not be thought to have stated a very hazardous proposition, when I assert, that if the law has taken responsibility from the executive, it has secured the people by attaching that responsibility to the servants of the crown Independent then of all constitutional considerations, I would ask, is it consistent with common sense or common justice to exact a written pledge restrictive of the free exercise of judgment, from those men who are alone to be responsible? Is it reasonable to expect that men should pledge themselves to act contrary to the dictates of their own judgment, when they only can suffer and be punished for that conduct of which they disapprove? But sir, when considered in a constitutional point of view, the question is only less absurd, because it is more alarming. If the crown is not responsible, and if the servants of the crown are allowed to pledge themselves to the executive, what becomes of that responsibility which is in itself the best preservative of the constitution. If the king is not responsible by law, and his ministers are not responsible by virtue of certain initiatory pledges, I would ask, where is the people's security against the evils of bad go ernment? Far be it from me to question the exercise of the prerogative; the king has an undoubted right to appoint his own servants, to select his own counsellors, to advance his ministers to dignities, or to dismiss them from his service&#x2014;but I maintain that the king has not a right to restrict the
<col>286</col>
range of their advice, or to controul the free exercise of their judgments. Honest men. who truly understood the public good, who were loyal to their king, and just to their country, could not listen for a moment to any pledge that when to restrain them from offering such advice as they from time to time might in their consciences think it necessary to propose. But such men were not to be compared with those political adventurers who, in their eager pursuit of power and emolument, were not ashamed, while they pledged themselves to the crown, to proffer their invalid s<ob/>ecurity to a deluded people. Sir, upon the responsibility of the king's servants there can be, in the house, but one opinion, and though I do not at all think it necessary to obtrude longer upon your valuable time, by attempting to demonstrate constitutional principles that may be so justly termed axiomatic; yet, when I consider how intimately the sacred duty of a privy counsellor is involved in the present question, I cannot abstain, taking it in this point of view, from submitting to you one further observation. The duty of a privy counsellor, as stated by Lord Coke, requires him to advise "generally in all things that may be to the king's honour and behoof, and to the good of his realms, lordships and subjects, without partiality or exception of persons, not leaving or eschewing so to do for affection, love, meed, doubt, or dread of any person or persons." This, sir, in my humble opinion, brings the question within the narrowest compass. Could the late ministers, consistently with the oath they had taken as privy counsellors, have subscribed the pledge required of them? Here, then, sir, will I leave it to the house. I shall not now enter into a detail of the conduct of the late administration; in my review of it, I find nothing to censure, and much to applaud. It is not for me, sir, to remind this house of their services; it is not for me to tell this house that that administration, in the hour of their dismissal, possessed the entire confidence of parliament, I have now, sir, only to thank the house for their indulgence, and to move "That it is contrary to the first duties of the confidential servants of the crown, to restrain themselves by any pledge expressed or implied, from offering to the king any advice which the course of circumstances may render necessary for the welfare and security of any part of his majesty's extensive empire."</membercontribution></p>

<col>287</col>
<p><member>Mr. Lambe rose</member> <membercontribution>to second the motion of his hon. friend, from which at no time could he refuse to withhold his support; but which at the present moment he thought a question of vital importance to the constitution; and had his speech even been less clear, eloquent, and satisfactory, he (Mr L.) should not have ventured to obtrude at length upon the indulgence of the house: for though the subject was of the first magnitude, yet he thought the spirit of the question lay within a very narrow compass. The rumours of an intended change of administration, and which so much agitated the public mind, he for one most deeply lamented to find realized; more especially as their dismissal was said to be in consequence of their declining to abdicate a right, or rather a duty, so important as that of advising their sovereign in all public matters to the best of their judgment and consciences. He was seriously concerned to see removed from the councils of their sovereign, the men who were such able props to the constitution, at a moment when their services were so necessary and he thought that the house would be wanting to its own dignity, if it deferred to express its opinion upon such a subject. He was glad, however, that the period of adjournment gave the house time to reflect calmly and deliberately upon the subject; to impress them with the necessity of adopting some resolution, expressive of their sentiments; and he therefore trusted, the one now proposed by his hon. friend, would be carried by a larger majority, and be adopted in a more decided manner, than any question which had ever been brought before that house. The constitution of this realm required that the king in exercising the functions of government, should take the advice of the two great councils of the nation, the houses of lords and commons. but the slow progress as well as publicity of their deliberations would, in many instances, destroy that secrecy, and interfere with that promptitude and dispatch, so often necessary to the success of the measures of the government. It had been adopted as a principle coeval with the constitution, that the right and duty of both houses to advise the sovereign, might be deputed to a selection from the members of both houses, chosen by his majesty as his privy councillors, by whose advice every act of the government was supposed to be guided; and thus, as far as was possible in a human institution, to give to the free government of England all the advantages of secrecy and dispatch which belong an ar-
<col>288</col>
bitrary monarchy. But what surety did the country possess, that this duty would be honestly performed by those men who could restrain themselves by a pledge to withhold their advice from his majesty, upon any occasion, however important or indispensable to the security of his majesty's dominions? What security had the country against such men giving their sovereign the worst advice, or how could the people be secure of their liberties, under the government of men, who, for the sake of possessing power, could violate their duty to their sovereign, break their oaths as privy councillors, and risk their responsibility as ministers? By such men, mischievous measures might be advised, which the wisdom of parliament could never repair; indeed, neither parliament nor the country could place any reliance on men who could pledge themselves to withhold the salutary advice tram their sovereign, which they were bound by their oaths and their duties, in all cases to give Sir Edward Coke had said, that, in the quaint language of the times, it was the wish of one of the greatest tyrants that had ever sat upon the throne of England, Henry VIII. that his privy councillors should leave all simulation and dissimulation at the porter's lodge, when they came to council. In his remark upon this, he had said, that the truth and the whole truth alone should reach the royal ear. But what was to be the security of the people of this country, if the doctrines now broached should be established? The country and the parliament might say to themselves, that his majesty's ministers were carrying on their measures for reasons known to them, but which they could not divulge consistently with their oaths as privy councillors What, however, would be the fact? ministers might be doing that which they knew to be wrong, and omitting that which they knew to be right, because, by their pledge, they would have tied up their hands and their tongues, and not be in possession of the means of fulfilling their duty, or complying with their oaths. On this ground he supported the resolution. If such a doctrine as that of the pledge required were to be allowed to pass, or to be sanctioned, the constitution would be at an end. ministers might be men of rank and talents, but by signing such a pledge, they would resign their duty as honest counsellors of the crown; and if the house were to sit silent on such a question, it would abandon that constitution which it was its pride, its duty, and its glory to maintain, to preserve, and to defend.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>General Craufurd</member> <membercontribution>said, I rise, sir, with all that diffidence which a person naturally feels when he offers himself for the first time to the notice of so august an assembly as this, and that diffidence is extremely increased by a consciousness of my inability to do justice to a subject of such importance as that now before the house. But, sir, on this most momentous occasion, it is impossible for me to give a silent vote; and I am particularly desirous of explaining the motives which lead me now to differ from his majesty's late ministers with whom I used to act, and for many of whom I have long entertained the highest respect and esteem. I flatter myself, therefore, sir, that I shall experience that indulgence which the house is in the habit of extending with so much liberality to new speakers, and I will make the only return in my power, by trespassing as little on their time as possible. The present motion, sir, differs most widely from the notice that was given of it, and it contains an abstract proposition which cannot be discussed to any useful purpose, separately from its application; it has arisen immediately out of the late change in his majesty's councils. Though quite abstract in appearance, it has undoubtedly a retrospective view in this instance, and we must take it back to its source, and couple it with the causes that led to the removal of his majesty's late ministers from office, before we can properly entertain the discussion; we must not be led sway by an abstract theory from the real, though disguised object of the present motion. It is not my intention, sir, to enter upon the catholic question in general. I feel myself quite unequal to the discussion of a subject of such magnitude; I leave it therefore, in the hands of those who are far more able to do justice to it, and duly to appreciate its merits than I am, and I shall confine myself strictly to the motion before the house, and to the consideration of that part of the conduct of his majesty's late ministers, which immediately occasioned their removal from office, and which I hold to be so closely connected with that motion, as not to admit of separation. Before I enter upon this consideration, I must beg leave, sir, to make one or two preliminary observations, from which I think there can be but few dissentient voices; namely, that adverting to the deep-rooted and most conscientious scruples which have been long known to exist in the royal mind, with respect to the
<col>290</col>
removal of those disabilities to which the Roman catholics are now subject; scruples that have the most religious, and I must say, the most constitutional foundation, because they arise from the most sacred doubts, as well as to the admissibility, in a religious sense, of giving such extensive latitude to the coronation oath, as in a political sense, of deviating so widely from the fundamental principles of the constitution, and from doubts too of the expediency of the measure, in immediate relation to the welfare and liberties of the empire in general, for which his majesty has, invariably, during the course of a very long reign, evinced the utmost paternal solicitude. Adverting, I say, to these circumstances, the subject of removing catholic disabilities never, in my opinion, should be brought before his majesty without the most indispensable necessity, an urgency so irresistible as absolutely to involve the safety of the empire. My next observation, sir, is, that in the supposition of such an extreme case, when it might appear quite indispensable to submit the subject to his majesty's consideration, it behoves those who may then be the advisers of the crown, to take the utmost pains to explain the matter most fully, to place it in all its views, to shew all its bearings and possible consequences, and to provoke such a deliberation upon it in the royal mind, as entirely to obviate the possibility of misconception, to make it clear beyond all possibility of doubt, that the king is completely aware of the full extent of the measure to which his consent is asked; and afterwards, if any unforeseen circumstances arise, to make an extension of the originally proposed measure necessary, another discussion and explanation equally ample and accurate, and detailed with the first, should be resorted to, in order most carefully to prevent an misunderstanding from this variation From the principles arising out of the observations, I think there can scarcely any dissent, and I shall now proceed examine how far his majesty's late minis<ob/>ters have been governed by them, strictly as I think they ought to have bee His majesty's late ministers, sir, inform that they considered it, after mature de. beration, to be absolutely necessary to d<ob/>e something in order to allay the fermentation which appeared to exist in the minds of the Irish Roman catholics; and they determined, in consequence, to request that his majesty would allow them to pro-

<col>291</col>
pose to parliament the extension of the provisions of the Irish act of 1793 to the rest of the empire, and thus to make that law in England, which at present is law in Ireland. Much has been said, sir, of the injustice, the absurdity, the great inconvenience and mischief of allowing that anomaly to continue, which arises from the act of 1793 not having operation beyond the limits of Ireland. But, sir, in my opinion, this is much more speculative than real, much more theoretical than practical. No case appears to me to have been clearly made out, of such inconvenience and mischief, though this direful, terrific anomaly has so long existed; therefore, I think the correction of it not of so much importance as has been represented. His majesty's late ministers, however, thought, otherwise, and acted upon that opinion. After much discussion, his majesty was at last prevailed upon to give his reluctant assent to the proposed measure. It is not denied that the consent was positive; but it is equally certain that it was most reluctant. Now, sir, whence did this reluctance arise? Undoubtedly not from any disinclination on the part of his majesty to dispense justice throughout this empire, with the most extended, most liberal, and most impartial hand, certainly not from any want of paternal solicitude of the tenderest nature for the universal welfare, prosperity, tranquillity, and happiness of his subjects. The whole of his majesty's most benignant reign, from the first hour of it, to the present, has been one great uninterrupted proof of the contrary. But, sir, I conceive this reluctance chiefly to have arisen from a conviction that the measure was not necessary, as the inconvenience arising from the anomaly was much more speculative than real, and that infinite practical mischief might probably ensue from agitating the question of the catholic disabilities at all, because it might give rise to pretensions and claims which his majesty would find it his indispensable constitutional duty to resist. This reluctant consent being obtained, the next step was to send a dispatch on the subject, to the lord lieutenant of Ireland. Now, sir, if there can exist one case which, above all others, requires that the utmost pains should be taken to make the communication relative to it clear, explicit, and unequivocal beyond all possibility of misconstruction, it certainly was the present. I say, sir, that it behoved ministers to be more careful in
<col>292</col>
wording this dispatch than any other, so that it might admit of only one possible interpretation. It was their bounden duty to take care that the dispatch kept exactly within the limits of his majesty's consent. This for the most obvious reason, any misinterpretation of it being pregnant with consequences so much to be deprecated. But, sir, instead of this, it seems that the expression of laying open "all commissions whatever," was made use of. This was certainly not illustrative of the provisions of the act of 1793, to which alone the king had consented; and how to account for such a great inaccuracy being committed by such able men, by men so versed in business, I must leave to the house to determine; I cannot. The next step we come to is, the noble viscount's notice of a motion for leave to add some clauses to the mutiny bill. In the wording of this notice, we find the expression laying open "certain commissions." This expression is, sir, in exact conformity to the bill of 1793, and consequently to his majesty's consent, but differs totally from the dispatch above alluded to, though that dispatch ought to have been literally expressive of the king's consent to his ministers proposing to this house that the Irish bill of 1793 should have force of law in the rest of the empire. The king's consent went no further; the dispatch went a great deal further; the one was limited, the other unlimited. When this dispatch was read to the committee of Irish catholics, in Dublin, they naturally caught hold of the expression, "all commissions whatever," which produced the only effect it could produce, namely, their raising at once in their minds the most sanguine expectations. But still, sir, such was their astonishment at the king's having at once given up the opinions and principles of his whole life, which had hitherto appeared to be too firmly fixed ever to be eradicated or shaken; so astonished were they at this sweeping removal of such an important and extensive portion of their disabilities, that they could hardly believe it, though the expression seemed only to admit of one interpretation, and they signify their wish for a further explanation, from the lord lieutenant. A communication to this effect arrives from the lord lieutenant. This communication, with the draft of a dispatch in answer, admitting that interpretation of the former dispatch which was put upon it by the Catholics, is sent down to his majesty at Windsor by an ordi-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0162"/>
<col>293</col>
nary messenger, without any great pains, I understand, being taken to draw the royal attention to the novelty of the case; in short, with just as little ceremony as if it were an ordinary dispatch to a foreign minister. Now, sir, as a new case had arisen entirely different from the former, did it not behove his majesty's ministers immediately to bring on the most unequivocal explanation? Did it not behove them to state to the king that it was quite another thing to which his consent was now required? That he had originally acceded to a limited removal of restraints, but that this went to an unlimited one? If it were judged necessary in the first instance, as I understand it was, to send a cabinet minister to explain the subject to the king, was it not ten thousand times more necessary to do so now? At first, his majesty was only asked to agree to that being law in England which had long been so in Ireland; but the new proposal was to make that law now, which had never been so before in any part of the empire. The first went to laying open to the Catholics commissions from the rank of colonel downwards; this, to placing them in the command of armies. But, sir, though the personal intercession, and verbal explanation and discussion of a cabinet minister was judged necessary in the case of minor importance, a written document, sent by a common messenger, was thought sufficient, when the superior importance of the case was beyond the reach of comparison. This dispatch is returned from Windsor without any comment. What was the natural inference from this circumstance? Was it not that either his majesty did not exactly see the extent of the measure, or that he reserved his objections for a personal interview with his ministers? Could it rationally be supposed, when so much difficulty had been found in obtaining his majesty's consent to the original limited measure, to the mere correction of a legal anomaly, that upon so slight au explanation the king would at once give up those scruples, which I have before stated to have such a sacred and constitutional foundation? That he would at once agree to such an extensive diminution of the Catholics' disabilities, though he had always held it unwise to do so in a political sense, and impossible to do so in a religious sense? Could it rationally be supposed that the distinction between religious toleration and political power, which the king had so
<col>294</col>
steadily adhered to, would at once be done away? Or did ministers think that a miracle had been worked upon the royal mind in their favour? Most certainly they could not attribute this wonderful change to the effect of their wisdom in argument, or the influence of their persuasive eloquence, for it does not appear that, upon this most important occasion, they had taken much pains to exert either. Would it not then have been wise, assuredly it would have been more decorous to have delayed sending the dispatch to Ireland till an opportunity occurred of having an audience of his majesty, when a verbal explanation on the subject might take place? But, no, sir, the dispatch is sent away immediately. His majesty comes to London very soon, and at the first interview with his ministers, upon the nature of the intended bill being explained to him, he gives the measure his most decided disapprobation. But, says the noble viscount, I did not understand this disapprobation as a refusal of consent, at least not as amounting to a retractation of the original consent? No! most certainly not a retractation of the original consent. His majesty has too just a value for his personal honour, and that of the crown, not to adhere most strictly to his word. But to what was this original consent given? Was it not to the correction of the anomaly arising out of the bill of 1793 not having operation in the rest of the empire, and to that alone? Had his majesty ever consented to this new measure? Certainly not; and of course it does not require much force of argument to prove, that no retractation of consent can take place where no consent has been given. His majesty <ob/>had agreed to make the provisions of the act of 1723 common to the whole empire. To this he adheres; but upon the new bill opening the command of armies and fleets to the Catholics, he pronounces his most decided disapprobation. By what rule the consent obtained to the original measure can be made to apply to the new one, which is so totally different, I cannot conceive. It was reserved for the noble viscount to discover that disapprobation means consent, and that the expression of all commissions whatever, means certain commissions. For him it was reserved to assimilate things that till now were considered as so dissimilar, to approach almost to the character of synonymous, terms which till now have appeared so opposite. Well, sir, the noble viscount armed with this disap-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0163"/>
<col>295</col>
proving consent, brings this famous bill into the house: and his majesty, a few days afterwards, finding that, notwithstanding the pains he took to express his unequivocal disapprobation of the intended new measure, this disapprobation, by a most strained construction, had been taken to mean consent, is reduced to the disagreeable necessity of stating positively to his ministers, that if they do not cease to countenance this bill which goes to do away in so great an extent one of the leading fundamental principles of our Constitution, to which he never had consented, and never can consent, he will be under the painful necessity of desiring them to retire from his service.&#x2014;The king, I am quite convinced, did not attempt upon this occasion, nor ever has he attempted on any other, to exert his influence over his ministers, in their individual capacity as members of parliament. His majesty has too accurate a knowledge of the British constitution, and is too faithful a guardian of it, to attempt any such thing. No, sir, he only said, you must either withdraw your countenance from the bill, or yourselves from your offices. The ministers upon this determine to withdraw the bill; and here the matter might have rested. For, notwithstanding that the king had so much reason to be dissatisfied with the conduct of his ministers in bringing forward a measure of this nature, without his consent to it being most unequivocally obtained; still, sir, the king was desirous of retaining them in office; and here, I say, the matter might have rested. But no, sir! the ministers propose their sovereign stipulations, which it was impossible for him constitutionally to consent to. Yes, sir; I do insist upon it, and I will prove it by argument, that the sovereign of this empire could not consent to these stipulations, with a due regard to the principles of our constitution. That part of the stipulations, which went to reserving to ministers a right of giving generally such advice to his majesty as the circumstances of the empire might appear to them from time to time to justify and to demand, was quite unnecessary at least, because their right as privy counsellors, and as the confidential advisers of the crown, remained unimpaired: it remained just as perfect as before they consented to withdraw their support from the bill. What good purpose, then, could such a stipulation answer? It only went to the constitu-
<col>296</col>
tional right of giving their advice as long is they remained in office, and that had never been disputed. Therefore, sir, I must always think this part of the condition attempted to be imposed, quite nugatory and vexatious. But now we come to a part, sir, to which I must beg to call the whole, undivided attention of the house. They proceed to stipulate that they may have a right, whilst acting as the ministers of the crown, to go to parliament clothed with all the Consequence, consideration, and influence naturally arising from their official situations, and support, by their speeches, a measure against which they know that their sovereign has the most decided objection. Not an objection lightly or hastily taken up, but one formed upon the most mature deliberation, and after having heard the subject discussed before him for years by the most able men, and after it had frequently undergone the most ample and elaborate investigation in both houses of parliament. This stipulation, I must say, sir, was most unconstitutional: it struck immediately at that very important precaution against the too frequent exercise of that part of the royal prerogative which ought, for the most obvious reasons, to be as rare as possible, namely, the negative of the crown upon a measure which had received the sanction of both houses of parliament. This precaution I consider, sir, as arising from a most wise practice which has generally obtained ever since our present constitution took a settled form, of the ministers of the crown not supporting in parliament a measure, to which, after repeated discussions of the subject had taken place in parliament, and in that committee of the privy council called the cabinet, they knew the crown to have the most insuperable objections. Now, sir, though this is not a written part, still it has become by prescription, and certainly from every possible consideration it deserves to be as much an inherent principle of our constitution, as any other, and it is absolutely necessary towards rendering extremely rare, if not entirely obviating, those contentions between the crown and the parliament so much to be deprecated, as pregnant with the most serious danger to the welfare, happiness, and liberties of the empire. His majesty, sir, as a faithful guardian of our admirable constitution in all its purity, which he has ever shewn himself to be, and acting up to that anxious solicitude for the rights of his subjects, which on every
<image src="S1V0009P0I0164"/>
<col>297</col>
opportunity he has invariably evinced, I do insist upon it, could not possibly consent to this most unconstitutional stipulation. I have been quite astonished to see it advanced in support of this condition, that upon many other occasions the ministers of the crown still retaining those situations, have acted as individual members of parliament in abetting great and important measures, that were not introduced into the house with the implied assent of the crown, and to see the instances of the question of parliamentary reform and the slavetrade adduced, to maintain this argument. Now, sir, can any member of this house, or any man in the world, seriously say, that those two cases and the present are analogous? The analogy at least is so distant as not to be admissible in support of any argument attempted to be founded upon it. To those questions, sir, I never heard that his majesty had expressed his decided disapprobation. Indeed I do not at all know exactly how his majesty felt disposed upon them; but of this I am convinced, that his objections against them, if any, were never so strong as not to be got over by the advice of his parliament, and that the royal negative would never have been resorted to upon those two subjects. This, I believe, was generally understood. But what was the case in this present instance? Here was a measure proposed of the very highest importance, not merely correcting a supposed defect, leaving the principle entire, but tearing up by the root a fundamental principle of the constitution; a measure, too, against which, as I have frequently said before, the crown was known to have so decided an objection, taken up on the most deliberate consideration of the subject for years, that it was morally certain the royal negative would be applied to it if it should pass both houses of parliament. If this does not mark the wildest distinction, I do not know what that term means. Almost upon every possible occasion, I am persuaded, that his majesty would sacrifice his own opinion to that of both houses of parliament deliberately expressed: but there are certain subjects which, more particularly than others, involve the great leading fundamental principles of the constitution. On these the crown is bound to exercise its own judgement, and support its own opinion, not rashly, but with due examination of the subject and mature reflection; even if this opinion should be contrary to that of
<col>298</col>
both houses of parliament; otherwise, that essential branch of the legislature would be neglectful of the first duty which it owes to the country, namely, that of supporting the constitution to the best of its judgement. The crown would become a cypher, a mere dead letter of the constitution, and our legislature would no longer consist of king, lords, and commons; but lords and commons only. And further, if the confidential and responsible servants of the crown entertain a different opinion from the crown on these supposed occasions, it never can be held that the crown is obliged to subscribe to their advice, otherwise the ministers would be a branch of the legislature, and not the crown; the crown would be a mere pageant, politically defunct. I must here observe, sir, that as ministers absolutely refused to withdraw the stipulation to which I have just alluded, the king would have acted unconstitutionally in retaining them in their situations, because he could not have done so without signing a stipulation which one of the wisest principles of the constitution would not permit him to sign. The counter-condition which is said to have been afterwards demanded by his majesty from his ministers, I must think, sir, was perfectly natural, and the immediate consequence of the conduct of those ministers. Their stipulations gave rise to the other. It was certainly quite a natural feeling of the human mind to require security against the recurrence of such harassing, such afflicting attacks, from which it was well known that no advantage could arise to the country, but quite the contrary, as they would be constantly reviving the agitation of a subject, which if it cannot be agitated to any good purpose, had much better, for the most obvious reasons, lie dormant. But, sir, admitting as I do that ministers could not bind themselves by the pledge required, I must ever think that his majesty could not constitutionally admit of their stipulation, and consequently that their refusal to withdraw it could only terminate in their dismissal from office. Had they withdrawn their demand upon the crown, the pledge they complained of would have been withdrawn also; but as they refused to do so, they were virtually their own dismissers. His majesty, sir, in the whole of this proceeding has displayed the greatest forbearance, endeavouring by every means in his power to obviate the necessity of removing his late ministers; and he did not
<image src="S1V0009P0I0165"/>
<col>299</col>
resort to that extremity, until they made it quite impossible for him to act otherwise, consistently with any regard for his constitutional duty. When I come to consider sir, the conduct of his majesty's late ministers since their removal from office, it does indeed astonish me more than I can express. This attempt, direct or indirect does not signify, it is equally an attempt. Therefore, sir, I repeat, this attempt to resist the indisputable right of the crown, this disclosure to parliament of what till now was ever considered as confined within the insurmountable limits of inviolable secrecy, this arraigning, as it were, the sovereign at the bar of parliament, to account for his constitutional exercise of the royal prerogative, is, in my mind, as reprehensible a proceeding as has occurred in this country since the Revolution; and I must say, sir, that it meets with my most unqualified condemnation. Having now, sir, discussed this most important subject with as much accuracy as my humble abilities, and total want of experience in parliament, will admit of my doing, and I am afraid quite tired the patience of the house, I must express my decided opinion, that his majesty's late ministers have not adhered so strictly to the principles which I premised, as I think they ought to have done; and though I may lament, which I sincerely do, the necessity that I am under of disapproving their conduct in this respect, as well as in many other particulars immediately connected with their late proceedings, still, sir, however repugnant it may be to my feelings to differ from those, for many of whom I have long entertained the most unfeigned esteem, and it is extremely painful, my duty is with me paramount to every other consideration, and were I to neglect the performance of it, I should forfeit that self-approbation which I value above every earthly good. In taking the part that I do, sir, I feel that I am conscientiously discharging my duty as a member of parliament. I feel that I am actuated by a just sense of what I owe of patriotism to my country, and of loyalty to my king, without the one being diminished, or the other unconstitutionally exaggerated by that extreme personal attachment which I have ever borne to the most benign, the most paternal, the best, the most patriotic of sovereigns. I feel, sir, that I am standing forward in defence of the due constitutional exercise of the prerogative of the crown against an attempted invasion, which
<col>300</col>
if it were to Prevail, might ultimately cause our government to degenerate into a tyrannical oligarchy, or a factious democracy, and we might then bid adieu to that blessed constitution, the glory of England, and admiration of the world; we might then bid adieu to that enviable political existence, which is the honest pride, and forms the foundation of the conscious superiority of every Briton; we might then bid adieu to that invaluable inheritance handed down to us by such ancestors as no other people have to boast of; and we might soon be fettered by the galling despotism or tossed in the boisterous whirlwind of democratic fury. I trust, sir, that we shall avert such horrid evils, and that we shall prove by the vote of this night, that we consider the crown as now standing forward, in the most paternal, and most patriotic manner, to support the best rights of the subject, by upholding a main pillar of the constitution, the fall of which would involve the whole fabric in indiscriminate ruin. It only remains for me, sir, to say, that I shall vote most heartily against the present motion; and I must make an ample apology to the house for taking up so much of their time, which might have been much better employed than in hearing me. I cannot sit down, sir, without expressing the most grateful sense of the liberal indulgence with which the house has been so good as to honour me.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ord </member>, <membercontribution>in the few words he had to say, should not follow the example of the hon. general, but should abstain from any discussion of the merits of the Catholic bill. Though he had supported that bill, he thought the consideration of it wholly irrelevant to the present question. He was sorry his majesty's late ministers had consented to withdraw it, but that bill did not appear to him to have any thing to do with their removal from office. It was their refusal to give a pledge not to advise his majesty upon the subject, that had caused their removal, and if they had signed that pledge, there was no disgrace and reproach which they would not have merited. Such a pledge would have made the king absolute, and removed the responsibility of his ministers. He approved of the measures of the late ministers, and sincerely regretted their removal from office. But that regret might perhaps be lighter, if they had been succeeded by men of talents or abilities. But were not their successors the dregs of a disgraced
<image src="S1V0009P0I0166"/>
<col>301</col>
administration? Were they not the persons who had held the seals of office for a few hours, on a former occasion, in their possession, and carried them back again in acknowledgement of their own imbecility? He wished the house to consider what m<ob/>ight be the consequence of their administration in Ireland. If they continued tosact upon the principles of the system upon which they had come in, their measures would lead to a separation of the two countries. Such would be the cons<ob/>equences of the administration of those who professed to come into office as the supporters of constitutional prerogatives of the crown, and the existing establishments of the church and state.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitsked Keene</member> <membercontribution>expressed his regret to be forced to vote on the question, but felt compelled to vote against the motion, because he thought it amounted to an issue between his majesty and his late ministers, at the bar of that house. The Catholic bill is wholly irrelevant to the question; but as it had been introduced into the discussion, he should say upon it, that though he was a friend to the most unlimited toleration, he would not consent to any grant of power to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wharton</member> <membercontribution>objected to the motion on two grounds; the one, the words in which it was couched; the other, the line of argument which the hon. seconder had taken. He could not compliment the hon. gent. on his discretion in intimating, that although ministers ought not to consider themselves as under the controul of the king, they ought to consider themselves as under the controul of White Boys of Ireland. The hon. gent. by whom the motion had been seconded, seemed to ground his support on the idea, that when noble lords and gentlemen were called to the councils of his majesty, they had no power to retreat, but must continue in office whether they would or not. Another point on which he opposed the motion was, that it was incompatible with the wisdom of the house to entertain the discussion of any abstract proposition whatever. Many abstract propositions might be considered incontrovertible, except when they were applied to new cases; and surely no case could be more new, than that an administration should lend its weight in parliament to measures which had not only not received the concurrence of the king, but to which his majesty had expressed an absolute repugnance. He
<col>302</col>
would suppose a plain and possible case he would suppose that, many years ago, some hon. gent. had moved an abstract resolution, that in any way to restrain the commerce of his majesty's subjects would be injurious to the country, and that it was the duty of parliament to prevent such an attempt. Such a proposition would have been good abstractedly considered, and yet had not the legislature recently restrained and abolished one of the most important branches of commerce? No abstract proposition was more true, than that it was highly criminal in subjects to take up arms against the sovereign. But suppose that another king James the Second were to arise, would they not be justified in doing so? Any unconstitutional measure of the king to restore popery, would justify what would otherwise be unjustifiable. Supposing that the king might have ministers, who, by advising that papists, acknowledging the power of a foreign potentate, should be admitted to the highest offices of the state, should tacitly declare the immediate ancestors of the king usurpers; surely in that case his majesty would be perfectly right in requiring from such ministers a promise that such advice should not be repeated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fawkes</member> <membercontribution>declared that, in his opinion, the question was simply whether or not we were any longer to adhere to the British constitution. Under all the circumstances of the case, he thought that his majesty's ministers had acted discreetly in withdrawing the Roman Catholic bill; but he must at the same time say, that in abandoning the bill, they had paid all the deference that was due to the scruples of an august personage, to whose feelings the bill was repugnant. Had they proceeded one step further, had they signed any pledge for their future conduct, had they ceased for one moment to be the unfettered advisers of their sovereign in the present state of the British empire, they would have been lost beyond all hope of redemption to all sense of decency and shame, and have acted in the most unconstitutional and unjustifiable manner. The responsibility of ministers was the security of the privileges of this country, and distinguished it from every other. If those ministers were no longer free agents, where was this responsibility to be found? If they tied themselves down to give that advice to the crown which should be only palateable to it, in what a state of danger might the country be speedily placed! He was astonished, he was terrified at the language of the present
<image src="S1V0009P0I0167"/>
<col>303</col>
day upon this subject. Such was not the language which prevailed at the time of our great deliverer, when the great councils of the nation recommended to him to dismiss his Dutch guards, and when a refusal on his part might have reproduced those scenes which had once deluged the country with blood. The responsibility of ministers was one of the best safeguards of the constitution; and, at once destroyed, though the mace might lie on the table, still the essence of the constitution could not be said to be preserved; if the great land-marks were once gone, we should in vain look for the constitution. It was impossible to recollect the conduct of the august personage alluded to, without sentiments of gratitude and veneration; but on a question so vitally important as the present, he would not compliment away the constitution; he would not surrender that glorious inheritance which had been left to us by our ancestors, who in former times, filled these benches with so much honour to themselves and advantage to the country. He felt himself obliged to the hon. gent. who had brought forward this motion, for having afforded him an opportunity of recording his sentiments. During the short time he had had the honour of a seat in the house, he had given his feeble support to the late ministers, because he conceived they understood and pursued the interests of the country. He could not, without sentiments of gratitude, reflect upon what they had done, to lighten the burthens upon the shoulders of the people. The abolition of the slave trade was another measure which demanded his approbation. Their intentions to bring the population of Ireland and Scotland into the service; their measures of retrenchment and economy, the advantages of which were hourly felt in every department of the state; their disposition to heal the wounds of Ireland, and to conciliate the affections of that important part of the empire; all these were irresistible motives with him for giving them his support. The extraordinary change which was the subject of such general regret, would however not be unattended with some advantages. The country would learn from it, who they were among its representatives who would never abandon their own characters, or the people's rights. Though the late administration had lost their power, still they might say with the gallant Frenchman Francis I, "We have lost every thing but our honour." This was a consolation which ought
<col>304</col>
and wouldsupport them. For himself, he had nothing to fear and nothing to hope from any administration. It was a matter of perfect indifference to him, by what set of men the affairs of the country were administered, so they were well administered. There was, he would admit, much shrewdness, great dexterity, and considerable talent among the present administration. But as to those great and commanding qualities which should characterize the government of a country, maintaining the pre-eminent situation that this did, they were removed from their predecessors to an incalculable distance. So thinking, he could not give them his support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Osborn</member> <membercontribution>would detain the house but for a very short time. He would leave to others who were better qualified to discuss it, the propriety of the measure, to the rash introduction of which the late ministers owed their dismissal. For himself, he was determined to give every assistance in his power to the maintenance of that constitution in church and state, in the principles of which he had been educated, and upon the religious observance of which he conceived the best security of that constitution to reside. Seeing no necessity whatever for the recognition of an abstract principle of the nature proposed, he would endeavour to get rid of it by moving, "That the other orders of the day be now read."&#x2014;The original question and amendment having been read by the Speaker,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bastard</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the misconception with regard to the nature and extent of the measure brought forward by the late administration arose, as he understood, from the most imperfect explanation afforded his majesty by those ministers. He wished to know the precise grounds upon which the difference between them and an august personage arose. He never approved of the discussion of abstract propositions; and sooner than entertain that proposed by the hon. gent. who opened the debate, he would vote that the other orders of the day be now read.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Maurice Fitzgerald</member> <membercontribution>said, he did not rise to consider the merits of the Catholic measure, though it was one, he confessed, of the first importance, and consequently entitled to every attention from the imperial legislature. With respect to the question immediately before the house, it was said in the course of debate, that the declaration of his majesty's ministers went the length of violating the prerogative of the crown;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0168"/>
<col>305</col>
but surely that declaration must have been hastily read, or very much misunderstood by those who made such a statement: for his own part, he did not see any thing whether in the declaration made by the late ministers to his majesty on the catholic bill, as it had been improperly called, or in the resolution proposed that night. What was the extent of the declaration which had thus alarmed the minds of gentlemen? What, he would ask a British assembly, was its object? Merely to preserve to the servants of the crown, who were also the responsible servants of the people, the liberty of exercising their judgements in the discharge of a duty imposed on them by the solemnity of an oath. Was it for a rigid observance of this sacred obligation, that the late ministers were to be censured; was it for maintaining their character, their honour, and independence, that it was deemed proper to withdraw from them that confidence which had entrusted to them the administration of public affairs? He was certain that, on an unprejudiced consideration of this most important subject, it would be admitted that their conduct did not merit the treatment it had experienced. But did they persevere in the Catholic measure? No; for as soon as they discovered that it was extremely objectionable to the royal mind, they consented to withdraw it. A deep sense of duty and particular regard to his majesty's feelings had induced them to yield to the bent of his inclination; but after having submitted to the royal consideration this measure, which they thought of the greatest magnitude, being one, in their opinion, which involved the interest and security of the empire, and having after wards withdrawn it from deference to his majesty, what more could they have done to give satisfaction in the highest quarter? Could it be believed that a pledge had been required of them at the very moment when they had given such strong proof of their high respect for his majesty's opinion? This, however, they declined to do, because such a pledge would be, in their estimation, a departure from every honest principle, a violation of their oaths as his majesty's counsellors, and an infringement of the constitution. If they had not maintained their honour unsullied, they must surely for feit all claim to confidence, and receive what they would undoubtedly merit, public indignation and censure. This being the case with respect to the declaration of the late ministers, he would ask, whether we could, with any pro-
<col>306</col>
priety, be called on to repose confidence in those who succeeded them? He did not mean to say, that his majesty's present ministers had given any such pledge as that required from the late ministers: but what was the fair inference? Unquestionably, that they were ready to do what their predecessors in office had declined. He candidly confessed that he was unwilling to place any reliance on such men, under the circumstances of the case. He did not see any ground on which they had entitled themselves to the confidence of the country, whether he considered the motives which had induced them to come into office, or whether he looked to the effect likely to be produced by such an administration. Here the question naturally suggested itself, what influence could such a change produce in Ireland? That unfortunate country was in the enjoyment of perfect tranquillity, and greatly attached to its government. If he were to refer to the sentiments of Ireland respecting the late ministers, he could not more strongly instance them than by stating the support given to them by a right hon. member (Mr. Grattan), whom he should not attempt to panegyrize. That right hon. gent. possessed the confidence of his countrymen, and he approved of those ministers. With respect to the state of Ireland generally, he was sorry to observe, that a total ignorance of it existed in England. He regretted to see, like wise, that an apathy prevailed which might lead to the worst consequences. He was aware that this topic was unpalatable to many, and indifferent to more. For this, and other reasons, he did not wish to dwell upon the subject, but he could not dismiss it without asking whether it was of any importance to this country to have the support of 4 or 5 millions of people to co-operate in the present struggle against the common enemy? [A cry of hear! hear!] Engaged as Great Britain was against the most enterprising and dangerous enemy, she had ever contended with, it must be of the utmost consequence to her to receive the support of such numbers in the moment of difficulty. The enemy was menacing the world with his numbers, and always boasting of his population: was it, then, at such a moment and under these circumstances, consistent with sound policy to damp the ardour, and repress the generous feelings, of as brave and determined a people as any in the world? He left it his duty, to submit these considerations to the house, however unpleasant they might be to any one in or out of <ob/>if, from th
<image src="S1V0009P0I0169"/>
<col>307</col>
firmest conviction that the principles of exclusion would be attended with the worst effects in Ireland. On all these grounds, he heartily supported the original motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Thomas Turton</member> <membercontribution>stated, that the original proposal of ministers went no farther than to make the act of 1793 valid in England. When they departed from this intention, it was their duty to explain it to his majesty; but did they do so? Did the noble lord explain those sweeping alterations, the tendency of which was to repeal the Test laws, as far as they regarded the army and navy? As to ministers claiming any merit for having abandoned the measure, he thought they would be more entitled to the praise of consistency and the support of the house, had they persevered in it. As it was, it looked as if they meant to claim for themselves all the merit of having introduced the measure, and of casting upon their sovereign the obloquy of its rejection. What, in fact, was the nature of the pledge, as it was called, required from them? They stipulate with their sovereign, that they shall be allowed to express their sentiments fully and freely upon a particular measure, when it shall come under consideration. To this he assents, but requires, at the same time, that he shall be no more importuned on a subject which is disagreeable to him. He says, in fact, 'You may do this,&#x2014;but, when you have done so, let me hear no more about it.' An allusion had been made to the conduct of king William, on a particular occasion. If the hon. gent. who made it, had carried his researches a little further, he would have found, that that great prince had been so teazed by his ministers, that he actually meditated the abdication of the throne. Gentlemen who made appeals to the house and the country, would also do well to say something in favour of the prerogative. Several allusions had been made, in the course of the debate, to the system pursued by the late ministers with respect to Ireland. Did it follow that these salutary measures were to be abandoned? If they were conciliating, if they tended to secure the peace and tranquillity of that country, that would be of itself a sufficient inducement to the present administration to walk in the same path. Some political prophecies had been uttered in the course of the evening. To such predictions he paid but little attention. He generally found, that those who pronounced them, meant
<col>308</col>
to act upon them, and that, having contributed to bring about the very evil which they affected to deprecate, they then came forward and claimed merit for their political foresight. The real question before the house was, whether the sovereign was or was not to be supported in the fair exercise of his prerogative, against an aristocracy which had the presumption to endeavour to dictate to him? No one would be happier than himself to see all religious and political animosities subside; but he would not, by rash and inconsiderate speculations, hazard the edifice of the constitution. He would wish to amalgamate and identify with each other the different nations of which the empire was composed, but he would not compromise the safety of the most important part of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Curwen</member> <membercontribution>declared, that he was not disposed to pay any fulsome compliment to his majesty's late ministers; but he sincerely thought, that, for their manly, firm, and independent conduct, relative to the pledge that had been demanded of them, they were entitled to the thanks not only of that house, but of every independent Englishman, who had the least spark of British freedom in his breast; as they had, as far as was in their power, maintained, unimpaired, a great principle in the constitution of Great Britain, namely, that the ministers of an English monarch being responsible to parliament, should not, upon any account whatever, or at any risk, agree to refrain from giving their sovereign such advice, as in their opinion was most conducive to the interest of the empire, and the liberal character of the first magistrate of an independent people. They had most virtuously resolved, that they would not <ob/>tie up their own hands from doing any act, or bind their consciences against giving such advice, as, in their judgment, any future circumstances might in justice demand of them to give. If the house were not to support them in such a free and manly line of conduct, they might expect, hereafter, to have ministers who would be subservient to the nod of any monarch; parliament might hereafter be disgraced, by becoming the instrument of the most base and wicked ministers, and the sovereign, instead of having the honour and the strength of being the king of a free people, who lived in their hearts, might, in future times, become the absolute monarch of a slavish and enervated people, who would not have
<image src="S1V0009P0I0170"/>
<col>309</col>
spirit to defend their own rights, or maintain his honour.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tuffnell</member> <membercontribution>thought that the late uncalled-for change in the council of his majesty could not fail of making a deep impression onour allies, and of raising the expectation of our enemies, and this at a period when a firm reliance had been entertained on the assistance and the co-operation of Great Britain in the common cause; for, could any one assert that either at home or abroad, the slightest confidence could exist in the permanence of the present administration. The right which the crown possessed of appointing ministers, was undoubted, but it was necessary that the ministers appointed by the crown should possess the confidence of both the aristocracy and the democracy of the country. To what extent might not the principle of restraining ministers from proposing any one measure go? It might be productive of the most incalculable evils. The new administration seemed to emulate the giants, who, when they were overthrown and touched the earth, recovered their strength: for it was not long since they had doubted their power to carry on the government of the country, and since that time their attempts at opposition had been repeatedly defeated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>contended, that this was just a question between one set of ministers and another. As to the pledge demanded by his majesty, if any minister had advised the abrogation of the Bill of Rights, or the dissolution of Magna Charta, he should like to know whether the king would not have been justified in demanding from them a promise to refrain from such advice in future, and, if their word was not to be trusted, to demand that promise in writing? Forty years ago, such advice as had been given to his majesty, would have been impeachable. He remembered the time, not 30 years since, when lord North gave up this point, and sent to Ireland 70,000 stand of arms, which had since been used in rebellion against this country. Some people said, that the late ministry had done great things. He thought the great family of which it was chiefly composed, had been always very full of theories, and no family had been better paid for their theories. By the first theory we lost America; by the second, the election act, a most contemptible court had been produced; and by the last and most fatal, the slave trade had been abolished. He
<col>310</col>
insisted on it, that the Americans acquire by that measure the traffic in 170,000 hogsheads of sugar annually, 170,000 hogsheads of sugar would be annually lost to this country. He knew that the king and all the royal family almost were adverse to this measure. [Here the cry of order! order! increased considerably, and the Speaker reminded the hon. gent. that this subject had been already disposed of, and had not the least connection with the question then before the house.] The hon. member then proceeded: Very well, sir; I may not perhaps be perfectly in order; but this much I will say, that I entirely disagree with the hon. member who has made the motion now before you, and disapprove of all that has since then been urged in support of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plunkett <memberconstituency>(attorney-general for Ireland)</memberconstituency></member> <membercontribution>considered this question as important in the abstract; but tenfold more imperious when viewed in connection with the late measure which was supposed to lead to the dismissal of his majesty's servants. The hon. baronet (sir T. Turton), who had spoken, had asserted, that the resolution went to attach blame to his majesty. He was most anxious to deliver himself, and those who concurred in opinion with him, from such an imputation; for he had, the highest respect for his majesty, and believed him to be utterly incapable of doing any thing of himself which was not called for by the interests of his people; and, therefore, those who had secretly advised him, had done a double injury; first, in inducing his majesty to believe that he was acting contrary to the interests of his people; and next, in persuading him to demand an unconstitutional pledge. Those who had led the Father of his People to believe that such a pledge was proper to be demanded, and who persuaded him that the Protestant establishment was in danger, had taken upon themselves the responsibility. The house had yet to learn how the Protestant establishment was endangered. He would keep that point in view in what he had to say, for as he was firmly persuaded that the safety of the empire depended on our connection with Ireland, so, he was convinced, that our salvation depended no less upon the stability of our Protestant establishment; and therefore he was an enemy to every thing that could have a tendency to injure that establishment. If there were grounds for apprehension on that score, nothing could
<image src="S1V0009P0I0171"/>
<col>311</col>
be more proper than to ring an alarm on the subject; but, on the other hand, nothing could be a greater crime than to ring such an alarm when there were no real grounds for it.&#x2014;He would not say that they who rung this religious alarm, asserted what they knew to be false; but he must say that they shewed a want of discretion which completely proved their incapacity to hold the reins of government. In answer to this clamour, it might be sufficient for him to say, that the measure had been abandoned; but he wished shortly to call the attention of the house to the measure of 1793, because he apprehended the extent of it was not well understood. The measure did not merely apply to Irish catholics, but to all Catholics, who might exercise their commissions in Ireland. By the act of union there was no separate establishment for Ireland, either in the army or navy, and therefore by the existing law after the union, it was competent for any catholic in Ireland to hold any commission in the army except that of general on the staff, and in the navy any commission whatever. The addresses therefore which had been attempted to be procured, were contrary to the existing law. Where was the danger stated to be imminent? In Ireland: and yet there where the danger was said to be most pressing, powers were granted to the Catholics which it was not thought fit to allow them in any other place. The alarm was rung through the country; and if it had been confined to placards on the walls, pointing out the terrors of the Pope and the dreadful evils of popery; if it had been confined to the introduction of choruses into concerts of ancient music, and the singing of catches and glees in favour of the constitution in church and state, the matter might have been passed over. But no one serious thing had been attempted. The peace of the University of Dublin had been disturbed by a person for whom he had great respect. The person he alluded to, was the chancellor of the University (the duke of Cumberland), who endeavoured to procure a petition from this seminary against the bill brought into the house in favour of the Catholics. When his first letter was not attended to, he wrote a second; and he was sorry to say that in that letter the royal duke had conveyed an insinuation, too plain to be misunderstood, that the only way for the university to recommend itself to his favour was to present such a petition as he required. [Loud and repeated cries of
<col>312</col>
hear! hear!] He was sorry he could not state the exact date of that letter, but it must have been written either after the measure was a abandoned, or before. In the one case, it could only be considered as a party man&#x0153;uvre in favour of the new ministers; in the other, it must have been the effect of secret and unconstitutional advice. This would come home to the feelings of every member. Religion was not to be used for the purposes of party clamour. It was valuable for its own intrinsic merits; it was valuable as a code of moral instruction; it was valuable in promoting the purposes of order and good government, and all the virtues and social charities of life. It was therefore equally criminal and impolitic to trifle with it and make it a stalking-horse. He called on those, therefore, who had always professed themselves to be the friends of true religion; upon those who were its friends, not in name only, but in reality; upon those who considered it as something too valuable in itself to be reduced to the degraded character of a party engine; he called upon them on the present occasion to shew their conviction of its truth, and the soundness of its doctrines&#x2014;He would now proceed to call the attention of the house to the pledge which had been demanded of his majesty's late ministers. He would not enter upon the general question which had been already so ably treated. He would not enter upon the danger to the constitution of having secret whisperers about the throne. He would not consider the novelty of having secret advisers to counteract the measures of the public and responsible advisers of the crown. He would not enter at length into the consideration of the mischief that must result from separating the interests of the crown from those of the people, but proceed immediately to consider the pledge with a view to the state of Ireland. If there was one subject more than another which ought to engage the attention of his majesty's ministers night and day, it was the state of Ireland. The general state of Ireland was this; since the commencement of his present majesty's reign, the Catholics had received a succession of benefits, and they were sensible of it. They had gained wealth, rank, and consideration in the community. It might be said, that they ought now to be contented. [Hear! hear! from the ministerial bench.] But it was not in human nature they should be contented. Could they be so, when it was so natural
<image src="S1V0009P0I0172"/>
<col>313</col>
for them to desire to be admitted to all the benefits and privileges of the constitution under which they lived? What was the state of the priests in Ireland? They were a body unpaid by and unconnected with government. They were, therefore, subservient to the wishes of the higher orders, and to the passions of the lower. As to the peasantry, who bore an enormous proportion to the rest of our population, they were in an unfortunate situation, from causes peculiar to themselves; which he would not enter upon. Whether a remedy could be well applied at present he could not say; but this he would say, that it was impossible that things could continue as they were. They might be better or they might be worse, but they could not remain in their present situation. People might shut their eyes, but they might as well attempt to overturn the laws of gravitation as to think that things could continue as they were. For the truth of this he might appeal to a right bon. gent. (Mr. Elliot), who was well acquainted with the state of that country, and who had been compelled to abandon a measure which he had in contemplation for strengthening the Protestant establishment, on account of the situation of the Catholics. Was such an exclusion heard of in any other instance? Every corporation, and even the most trifling bodies, had the right to petition the crown and to claim the advice of ministers; and wag this large body of our fellow subjects to be totally excluded? This was not only a novelty, but a most alarming appearance in our constitution. Nothing but an act of divine power could keep things as they were. If the Catholics were told that they had no hope from the crown&#x2014;if they were told that they could not proceed to state their wishes and their grievances in the constitutional way, they would do it in an unconstitutional way. What an hon. baronet (sir T. Turton) had said, with respect to political prophecies, was, he conceived, equally unfounded and unparliamentary. He had said that those who uttered these prophecies, had the wish to accomplish their fulfilment. He (Mr. Plunkett) was ready to meet whatever obloquy he might experience on account of his prophecies. He denied the inference drawn by the hon. baronet. He had in Ireland pledges too dear to trifle with the peace of that country. He owed the deepest gratitude to the crown for the confidence which had been reposed in him; he had no feeling
<col>314</col>
of hostility with respect to the present administration&#x2014;he was under no pledge to the late ministry&#x2014;he had only the desire to do his duty, and he declared that he regarded the situation of Ireland with a degree of terror and alarm which he could not find words to express. Gentlemen did not seem to know that there were fiends and demons in Ireland who watched for every opportunity of disturbing that country, and if the people were denied access to the crown, they would be thrown into the arms of the wretches to whom he alluded. The danger might not be immediately felt; but it was threatening, although it might be secret. It was not when it actually arrived that we were to consid<ob/>er the means of overcoming it; the means of preventing it ought to be considered beforehand. A momentary calm ought not to lull us into security, for the calm would be deceitful. He felt that we were walking <i>per ignes suppositos cineri doloso</i>. If the impression should go forth among the Catholics, that the persecuting spirit was to be revived; if such a line of distinction was to be suffered to exist between the two countries, the very existence of the nation, he was persuaded, would be in the most imminent danger, and the state would be shaken to its very centre. He had now discharged his duty, and whatever might be the consequences of a want of conciliatory measures, that reflection would afford him some consolation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Perceval)</member> <membercontribution>agreed most completely with his right hon. and learned friend, that nothing would be more contrary to the freedom of debate in that house, or to a full and open discussion of the different questions that might come before them, than the maxim, that political prophets wished to accomplish the evils which they foretold. He agreed that the consequences which might be dreaded from any measures, ought to be freely stated. But when he allowed that freedom to others, and put the best construction on their motives, he had a right to expect that similar freedom should be allowed to himself, and that his motives should receive the same liberal construction. If he, therefore, however erroneous his opinion might have been, thought that the measure lately introduced; a measure which the late ministers represented as so essential to the welfare of the nation, and which they had notwithstanding this abandoned&#x2014;if he thought that it was pregnant with danger to the constitution, it ought
<image src="S1V0009P0I0173"/>
<col>315</col>
not to be imputed to him that he had attempted to raise an unnecessary alarm, or that he had only party objects in view. He had stated before, and he now again stated, that the measure appeared to him to be attended with extreme danger to the established religion. He had stated before, that the measure would not have the effect of rendering the Catholics content with their condition; that it would lead to other objects, and that it would not stop short till it had brought Roman Catholic bishops to the house of lords; [hear! hear! from the opposition;] that certainly was the impression on his mind at the time. The arguments of the hon. and learned gent. who had just sat down, afforded some colour to this opinion, for he said that it was not in human nature that they should be contented, unless admitted to all the honours and privileges of the constitution. From this it was clear that he was correct, in stating, that the measure alluded to would not have removed discontents, and would therefore fail in its object. In answer to the arguments of the noble lord (Howick) opposite, he had stated that the Catholics would not be contented with that measure, and nothing short of an equality, in every point of view with the Protestants, would satisfy the Catholics. That was his impression, and on that he had acted, and he was ready to maintain by argument, his view of the question, at a proper opportunity. He would not now enter upon it. But the arguments of his hon. and learned friend, would have had more force if the measure had not been abandoned; how and why it was abandoned altogether, had not been stated, but it ought to be considered by whom it was abandoned. But, as it had been abandoned, it did not form the most material part of the present question. This therefore, was not the period for its discussion. The hon. and learned gent. had made an animated appeal to those who had always professed themselves to be the friends of religion; but he could not conceive how there could be any thing unconstitutional or improper in procuring addresses in favour of the Protestant religion, by those who thought the measure was calculated to undermine that religion. [A cry of no! no!]</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plunket</member> <membercontribution>here rose, and expressed his regret at interrupting the right hon. gent., but what he had said was, that i<ob/>n was unconstitutional and improper to use his majesty's name to procure addresses
<col>316</col>
of this sort merely for party purposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>in continuation, observed, that no apology For the interruption was required, because it was better to interrupt him, than to allow him to go on under a mistake. He agreed that it was improper to make use of his majesty's name for party purposes, or to influence discussions in that house, as had been done on the present occasion, in a manner absolutely unprecedented. The endeavour to procure addresses in this case was not unconstitutional, but he was extremely desirous to come to the question. As to the merits of the late ministry, his opinion of their measures had been stated on different occasions. But he could not confine himself merely to the words of the motion. The proposition was itself one which would be generally admitted; but it must be taken in connection with other circumstances, and especially the dismissal of his majesty's late ministers. It was not the expression only that was to be considered, but the implication, for it must be implied that the dismissal of the late ministers was an act deserving of censure. The implication was clear when the motion was coupled with the statement of the noble lord (Howick) relative to a pledge required and refused, and the consequent dismissal of the ministers; but more particularly so when the words respecting the impropriety of granting a pledge, "either expressed or implied," were considered, which must be understood to apply to the present ministers. [Hear! hear! from the opposition.] He was glad that he had distinctly understood the nature of the motion, but he wished that the hon. gent. who had opened it had stated that and not left it to be implied. However, if he understood the question, it would appear extraordinary if he should be debarred from considering it with a relation to circumstances, and as implying a censure on the crown. But it was impossible, in justice to the sovereign, if he was to be called to the bar, and arraigned. [a loud cry of hear! hear! order! order!] that the question should be considered without a reference to circumstances. He felt himself under great embarrassment on this occasion. They said that his majesty was not censurable, but his advisers. Now, it was contrary to the fact, that his majesty acted in this case, in consequence of any advice; he denied that any advice was given him on this point;&#x2014;[hear! hear!] He did not mean as to the dismissal of the ministers, but as to the pledge. He would afterwards maintain the propriety of requiring that pledge; but as far as he knew
<image src="S1V0009P0I0174"/>
<col>317</col>
and believed, no advice had been, in fact, given on this point. But he approved of what had been done, and was ready to be responsible for it; though he was obliged to state the fact exactly as it was. As to secret advisers, he asserted, there were none such while the ministers continued in office; when they were dismissed, his majesty had, of course, consulted others.&#x2014;Now, in considering this question, with a view to the circumstances, he would take three periods into view; first, when the assent was given to the bill; second, when the bill was brought forward; and third, when it was withdrawn. As to the first, the important part was, what must have been the understanding of his majesty when he gave his assent to the bill. His majesty could only have had in contemplation the extension of the Irish act of 1793 to this country. That appeared from the reasoning of the dispatch sent to his majesty, which went to the anomaly of having such an act in the one country and not in the other, and to the pledges that had been given. The words "any military commission," must have been understood as applying to that reasoning, as it was afterwards thought necessary, in bringing in the bill, to add the word "appointments." His majesty had withdrawn what had been considered as a reluctant assent to the additional provisions of the bill, and stated that nothing would induce him to go one step farther than the act of 1793, hoping, at the same time, that this would relieve him from all further trouble on this point. But it was not his majesty only who understood the measure in this way. Even the person who was to propose it, laboured under the same misunderstanding, and it was not clear that they themselves intended to go farther, for the Irish chancellor of the exchequer, in answer to a proposal for adjourning the second reading of the bill for two days, on account of the absence of Irish members, said that there was no particular occasion for the attendance of the Irish members, as they were already acquainted with the measure. But this was not all, for no less than three cabinet ministers refused to concur in the measure, when they understood the extent to which it was to be carried, he meant lords Sidmouth and Ellenborough, and the lord chancellor. The lord chancellor was not even summoned to the council, and thus the particular adviser of the king's conscience was excluded in a matter with respect to which it concerned him to be thoroughly informed. It was known from the first authority, that the person who was to procure the king's assent did not understand the ex-
<col>318</col>
tent to which the measure was to be carried. But this was not all; even the Irish secretary had his doubts about it, and under these circumstances it was quite clear, that his majesty had only the act of 1793 in contemplation. Here therefore, he would close the first period, having established this, that his majesty was certainty not apprised of the extent to which the measure was intended to be carried. The next period was that in which the bill assumed the form in which it was brought into the house, when a reluctant assent was understood to have been given to it. And here when the Irish dispatch was received, it was ascertained that the design of the Catholic petition had not been abandoned on account of this measure. It was ascertained how the demands of the Catholics grew out of the relaxation of the laws respecting them. It was supposed that this would content them; but it was understood from the Irish chancellor, that it would not, and that there were two or three other particulars which they required. They wanted to be sheriffs, to be admitted to corporations, and to be king's council. This being the case, in the communications with his majesty, a proper explanation was not given, and though there was no intention to deceive, yet there was a highly blameable negligence on the part of ministers. His majesty, however, being averse to the bill, they attempted to amend it, and then agreed to withdraw it. And here commenced the third period. It appeared to him, that those who objected to a general pledge, overlooked the violation of the constitution on the part of ministers. They had recommended the measure as indispensable; they said that not an hour was to be lost, and yet they agreed to withdraw it, and this they called "a sacrifice of private feelings to public duty." It was the oddest sacrifice of private feelings to public duty he had ever heard of, to abandon a measure winch they had represented as indispensable that they might not be obliged to abandon their, places. How did the crown and ministers stand on that occasion? they introduced a measure which they considered as essential to the welfare of the state, and then consented to withdraw it. Who was to be responsible for that? If the minister was compelled to act contrary to his judgment, this brought in the sovereign as the responsible person. The king never stood in such a situation. Ministers stated that they would declare on the Catholic question that their sentiments remained the same as ever, and this thr<ob/>ew the responsibility on the sovereign. Was that constitutional? However, as to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0175"/>

this, the sovereign only expressed his regret&#x2014;but ministers further stated, that they would from time to time bring the subject before him. They were to do this, though they knew that this was not a common opinion, which he might change, but a rooted principle, which he would never abandon. He was perfectly ready to admit, that ministers ought not to advise his majesty contrary to their judgment, but their duty was not to fetter the prerogative. Ministers need not have made these statements to his majesty, for they might have acted upon the principle without them. But this was, in fact, requiring a practical pledge from the sovereign, that he would not dismiss them for urging this measure upon them, and therefore it was necessary for him to have a pledge that they would not harass him. He accordingly exacted it, and they refused, for the reasons stated in the minute of council. Now, in what situation would this pledge have placed them? They could go on till circumstances occurred which should, in their apprehension, render it their duty to submit the claims of the Catholics to his majesty, and then they might resign, for his majesty did not stipulate for the eternity of his ministers. It was also proper to attend to the point on which the assurance was required. The king had a right to say they should not come to him with counsels contrary to his coronation oath. He thought that the tendency of this measure was to destroy the Protestant establishment in Ireland. It was not by the Bill of Rights only that the Protestant establishment was provided for; it was also secured by the articles of Union with Scotland and Ireland, and by various other provisions. They might call these the darker ages, and talk of bigotry; but it ought to be recollected, that it was to these ages that we owed our liberties and the Protestant establishment.&#x2014;The right hon. gent. then adverted to the impolicy of the declaration, that these concessions were necessary to allay the disturbances in Ireland, because it held out concessions as the reward of disturbances. Every thing that they desired, had been given to the lower orders already. The higher orders, it was stated, were already loyal; but it might be said that the concessions to them would encourage them to conciliate the people; but if they wanted this spur, he would not give much for their loyalty. He denied that he was ever animated by a persecuting spirit. On a former occasion he had only stated, that in case extraordinary powers should be necessary for ministers, he would not oppose them, and
<col>320</col>
warned them, that cases might happen where present lenity might be ultimate cruelty. He thought that the conduct of administration to the Catholics ought to be conciliating, but firm; as concessions only served to keep Ireland in an unsettled state. There was only this alternative, either to establish the Catholic church in Ireland, or to preserve the Protestant establishment in its full strength. With respect to the pledge, which it was insinuated that the present ministers must have given as the condition of their coming into office, he could assure the house that his majesty's present ministers had come into office unfettered by any pledge whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>said, the bill which was the immediate cause of the dismissal of his majesty's late ministers had his entire approbation, as he thought thereby we should have combined the physical with the intellectual force of the empire. The question now under the consideration of the house might very properly be divided into two heads; first, the conduct of the late ministers in respect to the Catholics; secondly, their conduct relatively to his majesty. The great object, as to the Catholics, was, that the bill lately brought into the house by the noble lord near him, had been promised to Ireland more than 13 years ago; and the particular reason was, that the Irish officer in England might be on a similar footing with the English officer, and it was certainly no more than justice that it should be so. The right hon. gent. had said, that the objection had been attended to and remedied by the mutiny bill; but that in fact was not the case, and it was certainly very wrong to have left the Irish officer, in case of his coming into this country, liable to the penalty of 500<i>l</i>. for attending his regiment in defence of it; and a still further and more galling dissatisfaction, that he could not bring any suit, nor be entitled to that protection of the law, of which every other description of persons equally enjoyed the benefit. The second objection was that of the common men, who were rendered liable to the greatest difficulties and severest disabilities. They were compelled to go to church, and prohibited from attending mass, by which we made the Protestant religion the tormentor of the Roman Catholic soldier and his own religion the engine of his punishment. For his own part, he was free to own he did not possess that agonizing foresight which could see the ruin or the church in our having a Roman Catholic staff-officer; and he feared, if we continued to proceed on that idea, we might avoid dangers that were only imaginary, but should certainly
<image src="S1V0009P0I0176"/>
<col>321</col>
incur those that were real. The bill, was part of the national defence, and the question was, whether they should continue to impose disabilities, which operated not merely on the Roman Catholics, but greatly to the disadvantage of the whole empire. The objections stated by the right hon. gent. were stronger as to the principle of the bill, than to the bill itself. He seemed to think that the principle of the bill tended to subvert and overturn the established church. In this he differed with him altogether, for he considered the principle of the bill as calculated to soften and mitigate the asperity of religious prejudices, to amalgamate and blend the jarring opinions of men professing different religious persuasions, and to unite them all in one common bond of union, so that they might act together freely and heartily in the defence of the whole empire. To effect this would, in his opinion, secure the established church on the most permanent foundation, by a union of all men of all religious opinions, without which he feared the empire could not be long preserved. The principle of the bill went to give the Catholics of Ireland a participation in the defence of the country, by enabling them to enjoy commissions in the army and navy, and to shew them that they were in future to be placed on a more liberal footing with regard to the law. The right hon. gent. had argued, that it was not in human nature for the Roman Catholics to be contented with what was granted them by the bill; but the fact was, the right hon. gent. mistook human nature, substituted for it a casuistical argument, and then debased human nature to make it subservient to his own casuistry. The right hon. gent. had talked of the Roman Catholics wanting to establish high ranks in the orders of their religion, and to have magnificent bishops. How they were to do this he could not tell, unless they were to get the French to make Irish bishops rich, who had already made French bishops poor. The right hon. gent. and others had said, that the Roman Catholics in Ireland were dissatisfied. As to that, he would not deny that they might be so at particular periods of time. He had known them to be sometimes satisfied, and sometimes the contrary. They where satisfied, he said, when the administration was such as pursued a system of lenity, and did not harass them with disabilities; they were dissatisfied when a contrary conduct was observed towards them. In 1793, they were highly satisfied with what was done in their behalf. He would not say they were so at another period, when they had been
<col>322</col>
persecuted for no greater offence than the great and mighty crime of presenting a petition. There was an instance on record, where two men in the county of Wexford were, for the crime of presenting a petition, indicted and brought to trial; and when the witnesses came to be heard against them, the judge declared from the bench that every one of them ought to be prosecuted. If they were to treat the Catholics of Ireland in the way they had been treated by the late ministers, they would be greatly satisfied. He would not say they would be altogether satisfied without power, but they would be so far satisfied as to fight the French, which is what is very much to be desired. By conceding to them the advantages they would have derived from the late bill, it gave them what he might call with the poet&#x2014;"the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war." It made them in some sort congenial with ourselves, and thereby gave them an enthusiasm which they could not, under the present circumstances, be supposed to possess. The Catholics, he said, had been remarkable for their loyalty; in proof of which, he cited the preambles of the act of the 14th of the king, and several others, which went to that effect. It had been said that we ought to be careful in preserving the acquisitions of the church, and that by favouring the Catholics we should injure the church. His answer to that was, that formerly when the Protestants were engaged against the Catholics, the disputes were altogether between themselves; but now the French were engaged against the whole, and against that common enemy all had to contend. If they were joined with the Catholics, there was every favourable prospect and probability that they would conquer; if, on the contrary, they fought without them, and should be beaten in the battle, they would not be beaten by the Catholics, but by their own prejudices; which deprived them of their assistance. These circumstances required the most serious and attentive consideration. It had been said that his majesty had been deceived as to the nature, operation, and extent of the bill in question. He was at a loss to find out how this could be. It appeared that on the 2d of Match, the ministers sent all the clauses in the bill for his majesty's perusal, and they were afterwards returned to them without any objection. The bill was then given up; so that there could be no deception of his majesty on that point. With respect to the pledge, it was impossible they could accede to it, without incurring the greatest disgrace. They must have renounced
<image src="S1V0009P0I0177"/>
<col>323</col>
the principles of the whole of their former life. They must have relinquished the office of counsellors and the high character of statesmen, and have become the mere creatures of salary. If tied up not to present their opinions to the king, they would have given up what former ministers had never done; for many privileges had been granted to the Catholics, which they had petitioned for at various periods of time and been denied, but which privileges had, at a subsequent period, been granted to them. For this, various reasons might be assigned, according to the different circumstances of the times. He would suppose a French army should be landed in Ireland: would it not be natural to suppose, that privileges might then be granted which had previously been refused? Ministers, in pledging themselves not to bring the case of the Catholics under the consideration of his majesty, would have forfeited their duty as officers, and their principles as statesmen. He entirely approved the conduct of the late minister, because he thought it that of a great statesman. He had seen the effects of a former administration, whose conduct had been different towards the Catholics against whom the press in Ireland was continually loaded with points and paragraphs, which were good composition, but bad sense, till they stung and goaded the people almost to madness. If we joined issue with the Catholics, we should fight against ourselves. If we would do well, we should keep in mind that there is but one enemy, which is the French; and that our best defence against that enemy was our own unanimity. He well knew that the Catholics of Ireland did not dislike the Protestant people of England; and he hoped the English people would not insult the religion of the Irish Catholics. He admired the ministry for the mildness of the conduct they had pursued in consequence of the insurrections which had occurred in the West of Ireland. It had been productive of the happiest effects, by putting a speedy end to them, without applying to the military for their assistance. He had before admired lord Hardwicke for a similar proceeding, who, instead of letting slip the dogs of war, had sent forth the judges into the different disturbed counties; and put an end to the disturbance by the fair, impartial, and equal hand of the law. If he were to say how he thought Ireland ought to be treated, he would advise that the utmost leniency should be observed. He would make tolerance the rule and guide of his conduct: he would tell the Irish Catholics, what he hoped the vote of that
<col>324</col>
night would assure them of, that they had not only a root in England, but a root also in that house; and by those means, he had no doubt, that whatever might be the event of the question, the two nations would be united as one, and the integrity of the empire established.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Duigenan</member> <membercontribution>began by stating that it had been said by several honourable gentlemen on different occasions, that the greater part of the army and navy of this country consisted of Irish Catholics. He denied such to be the fact; and insisted that those Irishmen who were in our army and navy, were mostly Protestants. It had also been said, that there were 4 millions of Catholics in Ireland; but this statement was equally fallacious with the other: for the whole population of that country amounted to only three millions and a half. The Protestants were in proportion to the Catholics, as two to three in number; and in property, to fifty to one. The house had been told, that the Roman Catholics would be satisfied if it gave them the advantages of serving in the army and navy, as intended by the late bill. He would tell the house when the Roman Catholics would be satisfied: if Ireland were given up to them, and they were suffered to plunder and destroy all the property in it, they might then perhaps be content. They had at all times, and on every occasion, evinced a marked inveteracy against the Protestants; and in the insurrection of 1798, they had, at the very outset of the business, so prepared their schemes, that they actually destroyed 5000 Protestants in cold blood, in the course of a short time. They had burnt 180 in one barn, and committed every act of cruelty that could well be imagined. Many of them had been confined in prisons for a length of time; and after being liberated, had been found to be the most active abettors and supporters of the very next disturbances that had happened. According to the late minister's late bill, these men might be commanders-in-chief of the army, and admirals of the fleets of this country, whose daggers were yet red with the blood of their Protestant brethren. It was impossible to admit Roman Catholics to any portion of civil power; for they had a temporal power mixed with their civil and ecclesiastical establishment, which they lodged in the hands and supremacy of a foreign power, who was at this time under the rule and direction of Buonaparte, who nominated the bishop, and he the priest. There was at this moment an army in Ireland in the pay of Buonaparte. Gentlemen talked of conciliating the higher
<image src="S1V0009P0I0178"/>
<col>325</col>
orders of the Roman Catholics. Who were the higher orders? He knew not where to find them. He was sure there were not forty Roman Catholic gentlemen in Ireland of 1000<i>l</i>. a year each. In order to make those concessions to the Roman Catholics of Ireland, which were intended to be given by the late bill, there must be a repeal of the Test act, and of any other acts against the Catholics. Yet gentlemen went on to say, that this would not endanger the established church. What had already been the consequence? When the account of this bill arrived in Ireland, the Roman Catholics called a public meeting; and a Mr. Keogh laughed to scorn the whole of the measure, as not containing enough of concession; and in menacing terms, declared they would have all, or none. If the powers given to lord Cornwallis, to lord Hardwicke, and to the duke of Bedford he believed also, were continued, and proper powers by them delegated to the magistrates, he would engage there would be no rebellion, in Ireland. There had been menaces of rebellion, but there would be none. The lower orders of the Roman Catholics who had been guilty of disturbances, had neither leaders. arms, nor property. He knew them well. He had lived all his life in Ireland; and had been in every part of it. If a French army were landed in Ireland, he believed they would join it, to a man. There had now been an impudent convention-demand, nay, a direct menace, in case their petition was not complied with. This he considered to be the consequence of the concessions intended to be made to them, by a noble lord, not in that house, whose administration, he always thought, meant to subvert the Protestant religion.&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick rose</member> <membercontribution>to order. He said, the honourable and learned doctor had, if he understood him right, stated that there was a noble lord, not in that house, who had endeavoured to subvert the protestant religion, a crime of the greatest magnitude; and he called on him, if he were a man, to name that noble lord, that he might be arraigned at the bar of the house, and brought to that punishment which his crime deserved.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plumer</member> <membercontribution>desired, that if the hon. gent. knew of any noble lord who had been guilty of so great a crime, he would name him, as he thought it was his duty to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>said, he apprehended that every member had a right, according to the order of that house, to deliver his sentiments in such terms as he should choose, provided he did it with decency; and that he was not bound to name whom he alluded to, nor to
<col>326</col>
make any excuse, but such as he might think proper to make.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Horner</member> <membercontribution>said, if it was not too late, he would wish the words to be taken down.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>said, that in cases when any thing had intervened before it was desired to take down the words, it was too late to make such a motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>wished to know whether he had rightly comprehended what the hon. and learned doctor had said. He understood him to say, that a noble lord, a privy counsellor to his majesty, had attempted to subvert the Protestant religion. The honourable and learned gent. ought, therefore, to name him, that he might be proceeded against as such a crime deserved.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>apprehended the order of the house was made for the purpose of conducting the debates with decency and decorum; and therefore, that the name of a member of that house was not allowed to be mentioned in the discussion of any subject under consideration. If that was the case, he looked upon it as much more disorderly to mention the name of a member of the other house, as it might be the means of creating animosities between the two branches of the legislature. He thought, therefore, he was strictly justified in calling upon the hon. and learned doctor to name the noble lord he had alluded to; for such was his high respect for that noble personage, that he could not sit still, and hear such a charge made, without taking the notice of it he had done.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>conceived that the question of order had been decided by the chair, and that whatever imprudence there might be in the expression, it was not so disorderly as to authorize the call which had been made for the name of the noble lord alluded to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grenville</member> <membercontribution>said, it was impossible for him to believe, till he heard it from the chair, that the hon. and learned gent., after the charge he had made against a peer of the realm, should not be obliged to name that noble lord to whom he had alluded, that he might be proceeded against as the nature of his offence required.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>said, that being now called upon to declare his opinion, he would state it according to the best of his ability. As he understood the order of that house, it was not allowable to mention the name of any member, as it might tend to create altercation, and to interrupt the harmony and decorum of debate. He always understood, however, that it was competent to any member of that house, in the course of his speech, to allude
<image src="S1V0009P0I0179"/>
<col>327</col>
to the transactions and conduct of any public minister of this country, so as he did it in decent terms; and that in so doing he was not obliged to name the party, nor did he thereby commit any technical violation of the orders of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Duigenan</member> <membercontribution>admitted that he had spoken with too much warmth on the subject; but if he had used any harsh expression, he was sorry for it. As well as he recollected, he had used the words, "a noble lord not in this house." Now it would be recollected that there were many noble lords who were not members of either house. Having made this apology, he should not occupy the time of the house any longer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Samuel Romilly</member> <membercontribution>said, he should leave to the noble lord opposite (lord Castlereagh) to state to the house, what had been promised to the Catholics of Ireland, and to assign, if he was able to do so, his reasons for now abandoning them: he had no desire to revive any animosities on account of religious differences of opinion. The question now before the house was one which involved most important constitutional doctrines: it was highly interesting to the people at large, and as interesting to the sovereign himself as to any of his subjects. It was, however, a question which, although it contained an abstract proposition, was necessary to be brought before the house, because it referred to a principle which had been recently acted upon. The true question before the house was, whether or not it was constitutionally justify<ob/>able, or rather whether it was not a high crime and misdemeanour, in any minister in the confidence of his majesty, to subscribe to a pledge that he would not offer any advice to his majesty which might appear to him to be essential to the interest of the empire. He conceived that if any minister should give such a pledge to the crown, it would be a high crime and misdemeanour in such a minister to give it, and that the house would neglect its duty, and betray its trust, if it did not impeach such a minister for giving such a pledge. He could not help thinking that this was a matter of more importance to the king, in another point of view, than to any of his subjects; for if his counsellors were to pledge themselves not to advise his majesty upon any particular subject, when it might happen that it was their duty to offer him advice; the most alarming effects might be produced from that pledge. A question more important to the crown than the present was hardly possible to be conceived: indeed, the doctrine he had heard that night led him, from the great respect he had for the
<col>328</col>
understandings of the gentlemen who maintained it, to suspect that all he had for merly heard concerning the proper privileges of a member of parliament, all he had heard of he duties of a confidential adviser of the crown, all he had read, and all he had hitherto been thinking of the principles of the constitution, and ail he had read on constitutional authorities, had been entirely wrong; for he had always understood the doctrine to be, that the king could do no wrong; and he had understood that maxim to be one in which the security of the public, and that of the honour and dignity of the crown, were united, and a maxim on which both these points materially depended; for, by this sort of pledge, the whole nature of the responsibility of state affairs would be taken away; there would be no security against the most traitorous intentions of irresponsible advisers; for ministers would not be answerable, and could not be answerable, for any advice which they did not give; and they could not give that which they stood pledged to withhold. This matter was the more alarming, when he learnt from the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, that he thought there were cases wherein his majesty acted without any advice whatever. Now, without meaning to involve his majesty in any kind of censure, this doctrine went to charge his majesty with the greatest censure. But the right hon. gent. said that the present motion went to bring his majesty to the bar of that house.&#x2014;[Hear! hear!] There was no desire whatever to include his majesty in any censure tom what had been done; nor had this motion any such tendency; on the contrary, it bad a direct tendency to protect the king, and to support the maxim that he could do no wrong; which could never be done by allowing any of his ministers to enter into a pledge not to offer him advice upon any given subject. Indeed, he could not help thinking there was much novelty in the doctrine of the right hon. gent., who had taken on himself to say that there were acts in which his majesty exercised his prerogative without any advice whatsoever; and this he appeared to speak from certain knowledge on some particular points. The words of the right hon. gent. were "that to the best of his knowledge and belief, the king had no adviser upon that point of requesting the pledge&#x2014;that he did not believe the king had had any adviser; and that he did not think the country would believe the king had any adviser upon that point."&#x2014;Now, he had always understood that there was no
<image src="S1V0009P0I0180"/>
<col>329</col>
exercise of the prerogative whatever, in which the king had not some adviser; that even in calling certain persons into his councils, he must have some adviser. Unquestionably his majesty might call any man in the kingdom to his councils, or he might make a confident adviser of a man whom the house had declared they had no confidence in, or even a man whom this house had declared to have been guilty of a gross violation of the law. [Hear! hear!] His majesty might call into his councils such a man, and the law said, that the king can do no wrong; but those who advised the king to take such a step were responsible to this house and to the country. His majesty might call in to be his adviser a person against whom certain Resolutions had been entered on the Journals of that house&#x2014;a person who had been brought to trial; who had been acquitted indeed, but so acquitted, that not any of his numerous and powerful friends had ever yet attempted to offer to this house a motion to rescind those resolutions from the journals. His majesty might call to his councils such a man, who had indeed been acquitted by a majority of his peers; but who could not return to that house without looking at the countenances of those who sat near and opposite to him; and, from the association of ideas, read in those countenances the words they (and there were 52 of them) had uttered of him, "guilty upon my honour."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Jeffery rose</member> <membercontribution>to order. He conceived the hon. and learned gent. was making an allusion equally personal with that made before by the learned doctor, and that he ought to name the name to which he had alluded.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ward</member> <membercontribution>conceived, that by an analogical deduction from the decision of the chair, in the case of the learned doctor, the hon and learned gent. was perfectly justified in the allusion he had made.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Samuel Romilly</member> <membercontribution>proceeded. He observed that, by the constitution of the country, the choice of his ministers was undoubtedly vested in the king. He might call to his councils whom he pleased, but that act must be done by advice, and the adviser must be responsible. If it was allowable for ministers to exclude themselves from giving advice on any one subject, they might extend the same exclusion to others. They might bind themselves not to give advice as to the policy of peace or war, on commerce or finance till they left themselves no duty to exercise. It was, however, of the greatest importance to his majesty that the doctrine of responsible advisers should be strictly maintained. History had unfolded the evils of
<col>330</col>
a contrary principle having prevailed. No man entertained a more sincere veneration for the throne than he did, and he only wished to support those principles upon which its true security rested. The hon. gent. who moved the previous question, was of opinion that the present ministers had entered into no pledge not to give his majesty advice on the subject of the Catholics. Now, as the late ministers were dismissed because they refused this pledge, the present ministers were placed in this dilemma, either the pledge was implied, or they had deceived his majesty, for it was not pretended that his majesty had any objection to his late ministers, except the difference of opinion which occurred on this subject. If the former opinions of the present ministers were referred to, it would be found that some of them had resigned because measures similar to the bill which had been withdrawn could not be carried. He deprecated the exciting of religious animosities in the country. He had seen, with regret, a declaration of his right hon. friend (Mr. Perceval) in a country paper, which he thought had that tendency. He pronounced an eloquent panegyric on the virtues of his right hon. friend whose worth and sincerity he well knew; but he begged him to consider what dreadful consequences might result if he should unfortunately succeed in reviving religious animosities in the present period.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>regretted much that a question should be introduced to the consideration of that house which necessarily brought into discussion the personal conduct of the sovereign. The proposition stated by the learned gent. who had just sat down, that there was no act of the crown without responsibility, was no doubt correct, generally speaking, but yet there were some exceptions to that proposition, and among the first that must be admitted, where his majesty had no advisers. Such was the case when he had removed his ministers; and unless the exception to responsibility be allowed in that case, the king's prerogative of choosing his own ministers must be nugatory. Now, as such changes were liable often to occur, he could not but deprecate the idea of making his majesty's motives of action in those instances a matter for investigation in that house, and still more did he deprecate the public statement of his majesty's private confidential communications with his ministers, particularly as individuals. It was monstrous, then, to say that his majesty could not in any case act without advice, for in cases of this nature where he differed from his ministers, he had no advisers, and re-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0181"/>
<col>331</col>
sponsibility could not be said to attach to any one. When his majesty demanded the pledge referred to, and which pledge no minister ought to subscribe, he did not differ from his ministers, and it did not appear that he had any advisers, nor did it follow of necessity that he had. He repeated his regret that a question of this nature should be submitted to the house, because it inevitably involved the discussion of the conduct of the king, whose name could not, consistently with the practice of the house, be introduced on any such occasion. This was the first instance he had ever heard of, in which the personal conduct of the sovereign was so exposed to discussion in that house. But it was stated, that the proposition before the house was a truism. He would admit that, as every man must; but, then, could gentlemen suppose that such general admission exempted them from shewing, that there was any necessity for that house publicly to resolve in support of that truism? There were in this case two questions to be considered; first, whether there was any need for adopting this truism, and secondly, what consequences were likely to follow from its adoption? As to the first, the necessity stated was the personal conduct of the sovereign, and upon such a ground he could not assent to the motion. Although the right of the noble lord to explain his conduct in the transaction which led to this motion might be admitted, still, the propriety of making that explanation the ground of a parliamentary proceeding might be consistently denied. For himself, however, he could not but say, that he regretted the explanation had taken place, and the reasons which produced this regret, urged him also to deprecate the publication of several private documents, which ought never to have been brought before that house or the country. They were, indeed, such documents, and the paper read by the right hon. chancellor of the exchequer, was of that description, for the production of which the house could not consistently address his majesty. It would be indecent to demand a communication of such papers from the king, as had been on this occasion most improperly laid before the public. But, to revert to the question of responsibility, and to the consequences which might follow from an acquiescence in the motion before the house: suppose his majesty should be called upon by an address of that house, and he put it, as one consequence of this motion, to state by whom he had been advised to demand the pledge alluded to in the debate, or to dismiss his late ministers; and that the
<col>332</col>
answer to such address should be, that his majesty had no advisers in either case; what then would follow? Why, that blame would fall on a quarter to which, according to the constitution, no blame ought to be imputed. Thus the maxim, that the king could do no wrong, might be exploded by the effects of this motion. For he could not say where the operation of the object, which this motion appeared to have in view, might terminate. The whole question as to the exercise of his majesty's prerogative might be thrown open. After a resolution of censure upon the dismissal of the late ministers, another censure might be pronounced upon the appointment of the present, and thus the prerogative would be extinct. But looking to that prerogative, which must be exercised by the sovereign alone, as essential to the constitution, because essential to preserve the power and importance of the monarchy, he could not assent to a motion, which had a tendency to, or at least threatened consequences, which might shake its security. Under all these circumstances, the right hon. gent. felt himself bound to dissent from the motion before the house; and this must be considered to him a duty of some pain. For towards the noble lord on the opposition bench, and his colleagues, he entertained the most unfeigned public and private respect, and he sincerely believed that in the part they had acted, which he was compelled to regret, their only object was to set themselves right with the public. But when such explanations as had been made in this affair, must turn upon matters of private conversation with the king, he could not help expressing his sorrow that they should take place. He would, however, be always ready to bear testimony to the honourable motives which actuated the conduct of the gentlemen on the opposition bench, for whose character he felt the highest respect. With the gentlemen who occupied the treasury bench he had no connection whatever, although for some of them, no doubt, he entertained a friendship, but in this instance he was influenced solely by the considerations be had stated, and a sense of the importance of the question under discussion, in which sense he had no doubt the house would concur with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Peter Murray (in a maiden speech)</member> <membercontribution>said, that he fully agreed in the just and constitutional sentiments which the house had just heard. But before he proceeded to animadvert upon the motion before the house, he thought it necessary to advert to the remarks of the hon. and learned gent. (sir S.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0182"/>
<col>333</col>
Romilly) with regard to a subject which that hon. and learned gent. had chosen to bring under consideration, although not at all connected with the motion. That hon. and learned gent. began his speech by deprecating any deviation from the question before the house, and still more any rancorous remarks, such as he ascribed to the hon. and learned doctor (Duigenan). Now, he would appeal to the house, whether that learned gent. was less devious than the learned doctor, and whether he exhibited a spirit less rancorous? The hon. baronet contended that it was not necessary to move the rescinding of the resolutions of that house, with regard to the noble lord (Melville) referred to by the learned gent., after he had been acquitted by the tribunal before which he was tried, any more than it would be to propose expunging an information at law from the record after the subject of that information had been acquitted. Such a proceeding was neither usual nor necessary. But the indifference manifested for the verdict of that high tribunal, before which the noble lord alluded to had been acquitted, proceeded from the same spirit of party which would treat with disregard the conscience of the king. This acquittal, however, ought to make a greater impression, if the circumstances were taken into consideration under which it was obtained. That illustrious person (Mr. Pitt), who was the friend of the accused, was no more, while, on the other hand, the party was in power who were his active and implacable enemies. At such a time the noble lord was brought to trial; all the influence of power was exerted against him, and that power industriously engaged in abetting and taking advantage of the false impressions of the case which had been spread abroad; still the noble lord was acquitted. But the learned gent. was surprized, that not withstanding such acquittal, the noble lord could endure the recollection of "guilty upon my honour," which must occur to him in the house of lords. Were there not, however, other words to be recollected there also? Was the word "guilty" alone that upon which the learned gent.'s recollection could dwell? were conviction, punishment, and persecution, the only things that could saitsfy his ears? The learned gent. must remember, that the noble person alluded to, heard that result at the tribunal, under considerations which must be satisfactory to him. But the learned gent. had insinuated that which had been said before, namely, what signified an acquittal, where so many of the judges voted for conviction? What, however, would
<col>334</col>
those gentlemen say if the converse of the proposition were taken in an opposite event? Suppose the majority of the lords had voted for the conviction of the noble person accused, and a number equal to the minority on that occasion, had voted for his acquittal, would those gentlemen allow the friends of the noble lord to say, "what signified a conviction where so many respectable lords voted for acquittal?" He was sure that they would not listen to such a proposition, and why, then should they expect that their mode of putting the converse should be attended to? That the noble lord's acquittal should do away any allusion to his case in the shape of reflection was but the language of justice, and he was persuaded that in maintaining it he was acting in unison with the candour and liberality of a British house of commons. With regard to the question before the house, the hon. baronet maintained, that when gentlemen on the other side talked of their own vindication, they meant evidently the crimination of the other party, and that party was the king; and to sanction their views would of course be to subvert the constitutional maxim, that the king can do no wrong. This maxim was indeed acknowledged by these gentlemen, but the tendency of their argument was this&#x2014;that the king could do no right but with them. Indeed, from the whole tenour of their recent conduct and observation, they had placed their sovereign in such a situation before the country, as to induce an opinion that he was a man of no intellect whatever, which, by-the-bye, was an exhibition only to be made by a party, if such a party there could be, who wished to usurp the power of the sovereign, and govern the country in his name. But he believed these gentlemen had found their sovereign quite a different person, from the judgment and firmness which his majesty had evinced upon this, as well as upon many other occasions.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir S. Romilly </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, said that he did not mean in the least degree to reflect upon the determination of the peers on a recent trial. He only intended to call to the recollection of the house, that there had been objections both to the form of the articles, and to the manner of the proof, and that 52 lords had said upon their honour, that lord Melville was guilty.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread </member>,<membercontribution> after complimenting the candour, moderation, and manliness with which the question before the house had been treated by his hon. friend who introduced it, observed, that from the various and contradictory sentiments which had been delivered,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0183"/>
<col>335</col>
in the course of the debate, upon the subject to which the motion referred, it was essentially necessary that the house should come to some declaration, as to what the constitution was upon this important point. It appeared that a very gross misunderstanding did prevail upon the subject of the constitution and religion of the country, from what the house had heard of the one from the right hon. gent. below him (Mr. Bathurst), and of the other from the right hon. gent. on the opposite side (Mr. Perceval). Some doctrines had indeed been advanced in the course of this debate, which, if not exploded, the power of the house of commons was gone, and religious toleration but an empty name. The right hon. gent. below him had told the house of certain times when the king could act for himself without advisers, and that as constitutionally he could do no wrong, no responsibility could attach to such actions. Now, this was a doctrine against which he must enter an immediate protest. For so contrary was it to the fact, that there was not a moment of the king's life, from his accession to his demise, that there was not a person constitutionally responsible for his actions. This was the doctrine which he and his friends maintained, and when gentlemen deprecated the consideration of the personal conduct of the king, it should be recollected by whom that personal conduct was brought into discussion. It certainly was not by his friends, but by those who asserted, that the king acted for himself and without any advisers. But this was a proposition which he would never admit: and the house of commons which should acquiesce in the establishment of such a doctrine, would declare itself a nonentity. The right hon. gent. below him had stated, that the king had no advice when the pledge was required. This assertion was also made by the present ministers. Thus they who professed so much reverence for his majesty, disclaimed any concern or advice in one act of his to which all agree that no minister ought to subscribe, and thus leave him naked and exposed altogether; withdrawing that support which they owed him; that is, in other terms, they declined to become responsible for the conduct of their sovereign. But the constitution would not allow them thus to decline and shelter themselves from responsibility; for, having accepted the offices from which his friends near him had retired, because they would not subscribe that pledge, these hon. gentlemen incurred the responsibility which they manifested so much anxiety to avoid; for a very good reason indeed, because the
<col>336</col>
pledge itself was such as no man could venture to defend. After some further animadversions upon the question of ministerial responsibility, and dilating upon the necessity of enabling members by some declaratory resolution to state to their constituents what responsibility really meant, about which, after the doubts it had been involved in by this debate, their constituents would naturally be anxious to enquire, the hon. gent. proceeded to observe upon the explanation which the house had heard of the conduct of the late ministers. That explanation, which was in his mind perfectly satisfactory, and which was strengthened by what had been said this night by the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, was imperiously called for by the misrepresentation of their conduct and views, which had been so industriously circulated by the publications of a pseudo "Protestant," in a morning paper, who had evinced as much bigotry as ever prejudice had ascribed to a Catholic, and particularly by the manner in which the minutes of the cabinet had been communicated to the public. These considerations, combined with the address of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, to his constituents, tending as they did to calumniate their own character, but still more to revive the cry of "No Popery," which had produced such calamitous scenes in 1780, rendered the explanations referred to peculiarly desirable, and he had no doubt of their having had a most salutary operation. With regard to the conduct of the right hon. (not "learned") gent., for he was no longer "learned;" it appeared that he held himself forth as the champion of the church, proclaiming that he had quitted his profession to save it from danger. If the right hon. gent. really felt so much anxiety for the interests and safety of the church, how, he would ask him, could he feel in his present company? One of his colleagues, the noble minister for the war department (lord Castlereagh), was pledged to promote the claims of the Catholics whether in or out of office, though that noble lord knew the danger which might arise, and as the old story went, that "the Catholics, might again wash their hands in Protestant blood." What Christian charity must the right hon. gent. have, under such circumstances, to associate with such a colleague! But there was another instance in which the right hon. gent. did not feel quite so much alarm as to the Catholics, or so much objection to their advocates, and that was during the administration of Mr. Pitt, who was also pledged to the Catholics. At that time,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0184"/>
<col>337</col>
however; it did not suit the right hon. gent.'s convenience to raise the cry of the church is in danger. Reverting to the pledges of the noble lord (Castlereagh), the hon: member alluded particularly to the paper circulated by the Irish government, which explicitly pledged that noble lord to support the claims of the Catholics. [Lord Castlereagh across the table&#x2014;Never, never so pledged.] The hon. gent. resumed and stated that his observation was founded on general rumour. If, however, the noble lord did not sign such a paper, the rumour must be groundless. But it was to be recollected, that although existence of such a pledge had been often asserted in that house, it never was contradicted before, and certainly Mr. Pitt never disavowed it; and he, as well as lord Cornwallis and the noble secretary of state, were understood to be included in it.&#x2014;The hon. member again took notice of the right hon. gent.'s endeavour to raise the cry of the church in danger, even after the bill was dropped and the danger had cased.&#x2014;[No, said Mr. Perceval, across the table, for the bill is still before the house.] What! continued Mr. Whitbread, does the right hon. gent. return to his ancient profession, to bring forward a special plea? The bill was laid down by his noble friend, and no one had manifested the least inclination to take it up. Therefore it had been abandoned; although still, technically, before the house.&#x2014;After some remarks upon the right hon. gent.'s predilection for politics, and his preference of that line to the profession to which he had been brought up, the hon. member proceeded to comment upon the coronation oath, and refuted the idea, that to concede farther to the Catholics would involve a violation of that oath, by stating, that long after that was settled, Catholics had seats in that house. The right hon. gent. had talked of the Reformation, but if the principles for which he contended had been formerly maintained, that reformation would never have been accomplished. He (Mr. W.) was as zealous a Protestant as any man, but it was no part of his faith to consign thousands to a premature grave; and to persecute, in any form, was not the religion he professed: Did the right hon. gent. remember the flames which only a few years ago spread destruction in the capital, and did he mean to circulate his advertisements, to revive the expiring embers? The question as applied to lord Melville, was not, if he, being acquitted, was admissible to the royal councils, but if he, with the resolutions of the house of commons against him, could be consistently placed in that situation of confidence. If this
<col>338</col>
introduction of his lordship was advised by the present ministers, they had advised that which was extremely disrespectful to the house. When it was proposed to address the throne, praying that his majesty would dismiss lord Melville from his presence and councils for ever, Mr. Pitt said, that it was giving unnecessary pain to an individual already sufficiently afflicted, since, as long as the resolutions of the house remained on the journals, he could not be received into the confidence of the sovereign. He (Mr. W.) put this situation to an indignant house, and to an indignant people. What prospect of advantage parliament could have with ministers acting under such discordant principles upon a matter of vital importance, he would leave to others to determine. It had been said, that this was not intended as a solitary vote. No doubt it was not: it must be followed up, and quickly too, by other resolutions. It had been objected that the house should interpose on this occasion. But it was neither unusual nor unconstitutional for it to interfere, and give its advice to the crown in affairs of such high importance. He entertained a high respect for most of the members of the late administration; but whatever might be his opinion of them, the question was not now who should be minister, but how we should best uphold the British constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>said, that at the time the pledge was demanded from his majesty's late ministers, there could be no responsible advisers. If then, there were no advisers, what were those who supported the motion doing, but trying his majesty's conduct at the bar of the house? [Loud cry of question! Question.]</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>observed that the impatience which was exhibited to come to a decision, would induce him to occupy as little of the time of the house as possible. Some things, however, had passed, which he thought himself bound to notice. The allusions which had been made to lord Melville, he maintained, were not foreign to the discussion. The hon. baronet under the gallery (sir Peter Murray) had called the late administration a faction: what part of their conduct deserved that appellation, he would leave it to the house and the country to determine; but he defied the hon. baronet to produce any instances of power exerted against lord Melville: If it were decent to enter into an examination of the proceedings on that trial, it would be easy to shew, that a great majority of the peers, holding office voted for the acquittal. With regard to the motion, he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0185"/>
<col>339</col>
had never heard language more unconstitutional than that which had been introduced into the present discussion. He agreed with his hon. friends, that there could constitutionally be no act of the crown without a responsible adviser. He also concurred in the opinion that there had, on the recent occasion, been secret advisers, and that much pains had been taken to poison the royal mind. He had reason to believe that the measure alluded to had been the result of advice. Indeed, he did happen to know that advice had been given, and this was a time in which he felt it to be his duty to speak out plainly. On the Saturday before the pledge was required, lord Eldon had an audience of his majesty; what passed at that interview, he did not pretend to state; that, he would leave the house to conjecture. He must also observe, that before he had liberty to state that a new administration was forming, lord Eldon and lord Hawkesbury had been sent for to Windsor. Lord Eldon and lord Hawkesbury were, then, the responsible persons. He had introduced the Catholic bill, in the hope that the advantages it was calculated to produce, would have been obtained without exciting any of those animosities in the country, which by artifice had been called forth since the question was agitated. But when he found, that, instead of producing union, it was likely to disunite, he withdrew it. These considerations, and the misapprehension which had unfortunately occurred, afforded a sufficient vindication of his conduct with respect to the bill; but he pressed it on the recollection of the house, that the introduction of that bill was not the ground of the dismissal of his majesty's ministers.&#x2014;He stated, that the late administration had in contemplation some arrangements respecting tithes, which was a constant subject of irritation in Ireland; but he was afraid that any proposition of that kind would have been represented as another attack on the established church. Even by the hon. gentlemen on the opposite side, the members of the late administration were acquitted of any intention to deceive his majesty&#x2014;an accusation which had been made against them in the public prints of this metropolis; but if they had been guilty of that fraudulent intention, that would not have rendered the demand of the pledge a constitutional proceeding. It was acknowledged that there was no other ground for dismissing his majesty's ministers but their refusal to give the pledge in question. This, then, was sufficient to authorize the adoption of the motion, for it was the practice of the house to proceed upon notoriety much
<col>340</col>
less evident than the present case afforded.&#x2014;An hon. gent. had argued, that it was somewhat extraordinary that discontents should exist amonst the lowest orders of the Irish Catholics, and yet the boon proposed was intended for the higher orders. But to this he would answer, that the reason why the great mass of the Catholic population in Ireland had not come forward of late years to furnish its quota to the military service of the country, was because the higher orders were not allowed their rank in the service, and that, in consequence, their influence was withholden from recruiting for that service. A learned doctor (Duigenan) had denied the fact of any deficiency in the recruiting service being felt on this account; for that three-fourths of the army raised in Ireland were actually Protestants. If this statement were true, it went in support of the measure proposed; for if, out of the military raised in Ireland; three-fourths were Protestants, and one-fourth only Catholics, where the proportion of population was exactly the contrary way, it was proof irrefragable that the Catholic population of Ireland did not furnish its proportion to the public service. He was willing to give credit to a right hon. gent.(Mr. Perceval), when, for the part he had taken on this subject, he disclaimed all illiberal motives; but yet, from his avowed junction with parties out of doors, and the language of advertisements and hand-bills addressed to his constituents at Northampton, it would appear that some little exertion had been made by him to raise a cry of religious rancour in the country. No man admired more than he did a man of truly religious principles, because such a man must be disposed to inculcate amongst his neighbours and fellow subjects all the feelings of mutual toleration, charity, and benevolence: but of all the mischievous characters which infested human society, that man was the most to be detested, who, with religion on his lips, and rancour and intolerance in his heart, sought, for purposes of personal advantage and temporal interest, to excite amongst his fellow subjects fanatical hatred and bigoted dissentions. He did not say that the right hon. gent. had done so, but he was totally at a loss to conceive how he could reconcile it to any views of duty, to give any encouragement to religious rancour, which could have no other effect but to disturb the peace and distract the energies of the country. The noble lord then proceeded to remark upon the opinions which had been held by Mr. Canning and lord Castlereagh, and particularly by Mr. Pitt, on the subject of the Ca-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0186"/>
<col>341</col>
tholics, and shewed that there was no more reason now, than in 1801 or 1804, to raise the cry of the church being in danger. He then made some remarks on the formation of the present ministry. Besides their coming into power upon unconstitutional grounds, and virtually under the pledge their predecessors had refused, they were persons totally unequal to the present state of the country. He shewed that the duke of Portland had, when head of the Whig party, been the most strenuous advocate and promoter of concessions to the Catholics. In 1789 particularly, he had shewn this, and recommended to the Whigs of Ireland not to accept places but on condition of gaining those objects. His grace had also said to lord Fitzwilliam and to the late lord Ponsonby, that one great object he had in view in joining Mr. Pitt was, to facilitate those concessions to the Catholics, Yet now had this same duke of Portland accepted office on the avowed ground of opposing the Catholic claims: and it appeared that by his interference a petition had been obtained from the university of Oxford, before even the Catholic bill had been proposed in parliament. The person who, it was understood, was to take the lead in this house (Mr. Perceval), had evinced such a degree of intemperance on various occasions, particularly in attempting, by unseasonable speeches, to embitter disputes in a train of amicable negociation, that he could not think the interests of the nation likely to be promoted under such a minister. When the language of the right hon. gent. with respect to Ireland, expressed at the opening of the session, was called to mind, it must strike every man how unfit such a man was, at such a crisis, to suggest proper measures for the administration of that country. Upon the whole, his lordship considered the new ministry formed upon such unconstitutional grounds, and so inadequate to their, functions, that if the motion should have the effect to remove them, it would produce an effect at which the country would have reason to rejoice.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning rose </member>, <membercontribution>amidst a loud call for the question from the opposition benches. He was not surprised on a motion brought forward for the purpose of turning out an administration, that those who supported it should wish to drown by clamour what those ministers had to say in their defence. But however reluctant he might be to trespass on the time of the house at that late hour, and, in the exhaust-
<col>342</col>
ed state of the house, he should not be deterred by clamour from offering what he had to urge in his vindication. The noble lord's speech seemed to place him in a state of retrospective responsibility for counsels which he could not be acquainted with, and for that dismissal which was the consequence of his own suicidal act. If he were to follow the course that had been pursued up to the speech of the noble lord, he should contend, what had not been denied on either side, that this question was an issue between the king and his late ministers. This was the first instance since the time of Charles, that a sovereign had been brought to the bar of parliament. The late ministers had by their own acts rendered their dismissal unavoidable, and he denied that he or any of his colleagues had given any counsel on the occasion, or had intrigued for the purpose of getting into their places. On the contrary, they had laboured to prevent the confusion that ensued from the measures that had been adopted. In whatever way the bill should be disposed of, he did not think it desirable that a change of administration should take place in consequence of it. But, when his sovereign was without a ministry, and had called upon him for his services, he did not conceive himself at liberty to withhold them. Nor did he lament the part he had taken. As to the circumstances that caused a change of government, he did not think that there was any intention to deceive his majesty. He should not impute bad motives to any man; but though there was no intention to deceive, there was too much misunderstanding in the progress of that transaction. When his majesty had declared that he would not go a step beyond the act of 1793, it ought to have excited the attention of his ministers, and they should then have distinctly explained what was meant to be conceded by the measure. For his part, he should prefer granting to the Catholics what was refused by the bill, and withholding what the bill conceded. He would sooner give the civil distinction than the sword. As to the call of the noble lord upon him, he should answer, that he did wish to form his conduct on the model of that great man, his late right hon. friend (Mr. Pitt). The noble lord had assumed that he was of the same opinion with himself on the subject of this bill, but the noble lord had no right to judge of him but from his public votes in parliament. He had given but one vote on his ques-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0187"/>
<col>343</col>
tion, and that was in 1804, with Mr. Pitt, against the Catholic petition. But the conduct of his late right hon. friend, when he went out of office, because he could not carry the great measure he proposed, could not be better illustrated than by comparing it with that of the late ministers. The right hon. secretary here called the attention of the house to the stipulations claimed by the late ministers, that they should be allowed to recommend one policy, whilst they pursued another. The terms upon which they wished to hold their offices were, that they should be allowed to propose measures, that they might afterwards abandon them. The yearly moving of the question would have the effect of making an unfair division of the popularity and odium. The odium would be great, and all fall upon the crown; the benefit would be small, and that the Catholics might have; but the whole of the popularity the ministers were to have. The noble lord had told him of the majority he should have, and of the vexatious motions that were to follow. But why waste his majorities? If sufficient to carry vexatious motions to embarrass his majesty's government, they would <ob/>&#x00E0;<i>&#x00E0; fortiori</i> be sufficient for the relief of his majesty's subjects; the noble lord ought, therefore, to carry his original measure. It had been said that no notice had been given of an exculpatory statement till atter several partial publications had taken place; but this he denied.&#x2014;The noble lord, said, the right hon. secretary, has chosen to insinuate that the king had in fact some secret adviser, and that the communication between his majesty and those who are now in his councils, began much earlier than we are willing to avow; and he instances lord Eldon's visit to Windsor (I think on the Saturday se'n-<ob/>night preceding the change) as a proof of this secret communication. I would not accuse the noble lord of wilful misrepresentation, but I must ask him plainly, in the face of the house, does he not know what was the cause of lord Eldon's visit to Windsor? Does he or does he not know, that previous to his going to Windsor, lord Eldon waited on lord Grenville, and communicated to him distinctly the subject of his intended interview with the king, adding, at the same time, a solemn assurance, that he would mention no other subject to his majesty. The noble lord may insinuate that lord Eldon did not keep his word. I believe he did, and at least I may safely
<col>344</col>
leave it to the house to determine, whether he conduct of lord Eldon, such as I have described it, affords fair grounds for a presumption of insincerity and falsehood? And I will add, sir, that nothing but the extreme delicacy of the subject itself, upon which alone lord Eldon went, and upon which the noble lord must know he went, to communicate with his majesty, prevents me from satisfying the house, by a distinct disclosure of it, how very far removed it was from any thing of a political nature. I know not whether it is intended to extend these insinuations to other members of the new administration, but as expressions have dropped from many gentlemen, on the other side of the house, which appear to convey that charge of intrigue and secret cabal, I think it right to say distinctly for myself, and I say it with equal confidence for my right hon. friend (Mr. Perceval) near me, and for the noble duke, who is at the head of his majesty's government, that not only we have not to answer for any secret or unfair attempts to obtain the situation we now hold, but that we did, each according to our measure and opportunities, exert ourselves fairly and honestly to prevent the mischief which might be apprehended as likely to attend a change of administration in the present circumstances of the country. If when the king was left without a ministry, and the country without a government, we have not hesitated to obey the call made upon us, we were not, however, so rash, so presumptuous, or so blind, in the pursuit of objects of ambition, to the real dangers and difficulties of the times, as to labour and intrigue for so perilous a succession. For myself, I confidently aver, that on the first intimation which I received, from authority which I believed to be unquestionable, of the strong difference of opinion subsisting between the king and his ministers, I took the determination of communicating what I had learnt, and I did communicate it without delay, to that part of the late administration, with which, in spite of political differences, I had continued, and with which (so far as my own feelings are concerned) I still wish to continue, in habits of personal friendship and regard. I communicated it for the express purpose, and with the most earnest advice and exhortation, that they should lose no time in coming to such an explanation and accommodation on the subject as should prevent matters from going to extremities. And it has been no small satisfaction to me
<image src="S1V0009P0I0188"/>
<col>345</col>
to find, in the correspondence which I have since had an opportunity of reading, that as the first attempts at explanation, on the part of ministers, appear to have been made on the day subsequent to my making this communication, my intention to do good, though not ultimately successful, was at least not wholly without effect. Precisely of the same sort was the conduct of my right hon. friend (Mr. Perceval) towards that part of the government with whom he had opportunity of communication. With respect to the noble duke at the head of the administration, I can state with full confidence, that the first intercourse which he had with his. majesty on this occasion, was taken advantage of on his part, not for the purpose of inflaming differences, and incurring or precipitating a change, but of advising and anxiously recommending a full and amicable, and, if possible, a satisfactory explanation.&#x2014;I venture, then, fearlessly to appeal to the house, whether we can be justly charged with having taken any undue advantage of the circumstances which led to the late change. Our only crime in this respect is, that when the difference between his majesty and his late servants became irreconcileable, and when it was obvious that the administration must go out, we would not consent to join with them in pushing our sovereign to the wall, by reducing him to the alternative of taking them back upon their own terms, to be at their mercy, or of leaving the country without a government.&#x2014;But, sir, when I contend that we are not responsible, and cannot, in common sense, be held to be so, for acts which were done many weeks before our coming into office, let it not be supposed, however, that I should feel any reluctance to take my full share of responsibility for that part of the king's conduct which is connected with the correspondence between his majesty and his ministers. Far from it. I should indeed be proud to be associated, in any degree, to his majesty's share of that correspondence. And painful as the whole of this discussion has been, painful as it must be to every man who values not the forms only, but the essence of our constitution, to see the king brought here, as it were in person, to be judged at the bar of this house, it is some consolation to reflect, that from the bar of the house of commons there still lies an appeal to the tribunal of the country. It is a great consolation to every loyal mind to feel, that in proportion as the sovereign has been
<col>346</col>
made most unconstitutionally responsible in his own person, he must inevitably become personally better known to his people. And when that people shall see their sovereign, full as he is of years, and labouring under heavy afflictions, yet retaining, in the vigour of a green old age, soundness of judgment, a promptness and vivacity of intellect, which have enabled him to contend singly in this painful controversy against the united talents of all his ministers; when they shall see him displaying powers as fit as those of any of those ministers, or of any other man that hears me, for the discussion of the most perplexing questions, and the conduct of the most difficult affairs; perhaps, sir, I say, when all this shall be made manifest to the people, and when by this manifestation, all these sinister and disheartening rumours, which sometimes accident and sometimes industry propagates through the country, shall have received their decisive confutation, perhaps it may fairly be doubted whether the inconvenience, the hazard, and the unconstitutional tendency of this wanton and unjustifiable arraignment of the personal conduct of the king, may not be more than compensated by the advantage of this display of his personal qualities. And while we regret that those qualities should have been put to such a trial, the country will rejoice in the hope which arises from the manner in which that trial has been sustained, that, after having for near half a century watched with unceasing care and paternal anxiety over the interests and happiness of his people, he may yet, under the protection of Providence, add to that length of life, and to that series of labours, many, many years more, of care and anxiety certainly, but of protecting and efficient care, and of anxiety vigorous and active for the benefit of his people.&#x2014;For the advice of restoring lord Melville to his majesty's councils, I am ready to take my full share of responsibility; but I think that such a recommendation would have come with a better grace from the hon. gent. (Mr. Whitbread) and his friends, who conducted a late prosecution against that noble lord to a fortunate acquittal. I shall only trouble the house with one word more. Whatever may be the issue of the division of this night, or of the series of divisions with which, if successful, it is to be followed; his majesty's ministers are determined to stand by their sovereign, even though circumstances should occur, in which they may find it their duty to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0189"/>
<col>347</col>
appeal to the country. [Loud cries of hear! hear! from every part of the house.]</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member> <membercontribution>observed, that however that house might be attacked, however it might be threatened, whatever unconstitutional language might be used towards it, he relied on the manly constitutional spiritand understanding of the house, that no such intimidation could induce it to surrender a constitutional principle. There was not one single member on the other side of the house that had answered the arguments of his. noble friend (lord Howick). A great constitutional wrong had been done, and the house would act consistently with what was due to its own character, by declaring with firmness its sense of that wrong. The only mode by which gentlemen on the other side defended the question on their side, was by a repetition of the mis-statements, which had already been repeatedly contradicted and disproved. He now again stated, that the proposition of any new measure, connected with the Catholic question, if circumstances should render it expedient to make such proposition, was, by the declaration of his majesty's late ministers, to be submitted to his majesty. An hon. gent. on the other side, however, had put a hypothetical case, and supposed that another king James might happen to ascend the throne, who would make this measure the means of subverting the Protestant establishment in this country. To this he answered, that if such a king were to ascend the throne, it would then become the duty of ministers to give manly, constitutional advice, however it might be repugnant to the feeling of the then king. But, if it were once admitted as a principle, that a king had a right to demand of his ministers a pledge, that they would not again trouble him with any advice connected with that subject, then truly would the Protestant establishment be in danger. For his own part, although he believed that the motion of his hon. friend would be carried that night by a majority, he did not believe that, had the Catholic bill been persevered in, the influence of the late government exerted at that time could have secured its adoption.&#x2014;The question being loudly called for, the house divided on the amendment to the original motion, namely, that the other orders of the day be now read. While the opposition members were in the lobby, lord Howick requested their attention: he stated that there were two motions before the house, the first, that the
<col>348</col>
other orders of the day be now read, upon which they were then dividing, and upon which it was pretty certain they should be in a majority; the second would be upon the original motion. Should they, as he trusted they would, negative the first, and carry the original question, it would then be perhaps necessary to propose an address to the throne, to meet the threat which had been thrown out that evening&#x2014;a threat unexampled in the annals of parliament.&#x2014;The result of the division was,

<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>brought up a report from the committee appointed to enquire into the merits of the petition complaining of an undue election for the county of Londonderry, and obtained leave for the adjournment of the said committee, until again summoned by the Speaker's warrant, in order that time should be allowed to the commissioners for examining evidence upon this subject in Ireland.&#x2014;Upon the motion of Mr. G. Rose, new writs were ordered for Christchurch, in the room of the right hon. George Rose, who, since his election, had accepted the office of treasurer of the navy ; and of Mr. S. Bourne, who had accepted the office of one of the lords commissioners of the treasury.&#x2014;Upon the motion of sir J. Newport, the Irish Stamp Duty bill, and the Irish Servants' Wages bill, were read a third time and passed. &#x2014;MT. Lyttleton gave notice of his intention to submit to the house a motion on Wednesday next, expressive of its sentiments with regard to the late change of administration.&#x2014;The bill for raising a fund to provide for the Widows and Orphans of Schoolmasters in Scotland; and the Dover Pilots Regulation bill, were read a second time, and ordered to be committed.&#x2014;Mr. Swan gave notice, that he would on Monday move that the petitioners from Lancaster upon the subject of colonel Cawthorne's Election should be heard by counsel at the bar.&#x2014;Mr. Huskisson, adverting to an order made last session, upon the motion of a noble lord (H. Petty), whom he then saw in his place, for the production of an account with regard to the Scotch excise for a certain number of years, observed, that, in pursuance of that order, there were now behind him two huge volumes, which only contained the accounts of one year, although almost all the clerks in the establishment had been engaged since the order, in preparing it. Now, as he could not conceive the object of the noble lord, or the utility of a compliance with his motion, he gave notice that he would on Monday move for rescinding the order with regard to the 23 preceding years to which it referred.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION.]</member> <membercontribution>The order of the day for summoning their lordships having been read,</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0191"/>
<col>351</col>
<p><member>The Marquis of Stafford rose </member>, <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, to submit a motion to the house, respecting the consequences of the late change in his majesty's councils. He expressed his regret that a matter of such delicacy and importance had not been taken up by abler hands; but observed that there were times and circumstances under which it was the duty of every noble lord in that house to come forward and offer the best advice his judgment could suggest for the maintenance of the public good. It had always been his anxious wish to see the best talents and abilities the country could boast of, United in a rival exertion of those talents for the public welfare; but he had to lament the loss of one distinguished man (Mr. Pitt) at a most critical period of our affairs, which considerably weakened the administration of which he was the head. He next had the satisfaction of seeing another ministry constituted, which certainly embraced a very great portion of the character, integrity, and talents of the nation. This ministry also lost one of its main supporters (Mr. FOX); but still it was one from which he expected the country would reap much benefit. That administration had recently, and very unexpectedly, been removed; and he was sorry to observe, that their removal did not seem to be accounted for on any constitutional and satisfactory grounds. By this double loss, and by the change that had thus taken place in his majesty's councils, the affairs of the nation were left in a situation which he could not but lament. Indeed, much as he lamented it, he had still more to lament the causes that led to that change, and the nature of the advice which induced his Majesty to make it. For, advisers in so critical a measure his majesty most undoubtedly had, whoever those advisers might be. It was an excellent maxim of the constitution, a sacred one in his eyes, which made the person of the sovereign inviolable; and which, by pronouncing he could do no wrong, rescued him from all responsibility for any public measure. That maxim he was confident their lordships would maintain, and upon it he would rest the necessity of adopting the motion, at least in part, which he should have the honour of concluding with. He trusted that nothing he should offer would be construed into personal disrespect to his majesty; of that he was incapable from principles of duty, as well as from inclination and gratitude; but his anxiety for the
<col>352</col>
safety of the state, and for the prosperity of the country, made him solicitous to see a more able and comprehensive administration. He would not impute to any noble lord the circulation of the misrepresentation that had gone through the country respecting the conduct of the late administration, and the actions that influenced their dismission from office; but it was with sorrow, and indeed with some indignation he observed, that many of these misrepresentations had a tendency to stir up religious animosities and disunite several descriptions of his majesty's subjects without any adequate cause whatever, and much to the danger and detriment of the general welfare. He next earnestly deprecated all such pernicious attempts, which could never be ventured on without hazarding the most perilous consequences to the country. Various causes had been assigned for the sudden change that has occurred in the administration, but not one of them was, in his mind, sufficient to justify those who had advised the removal of so much integrity and talent from office. He therefore felt himself justified in submitting the following motion to their lordships: "That this house, feeling the necessity of a firm and stable government in this most important crisis of public affairs, is impressed with the deepest regret at the change which has lately taken place in his majesty's councils, and that this regret is greatly increased by the causes to which the change has been ascribed; it being the opinion of this house, that it is contrary to the first duties of the responsible ministers of the king to restrain themselves by any pledge, expressed or implied, from submitting to his majesty faithfully and truly, any advice, which in their judgement, the course of circumstances may render necessary for the honour of his majesty's crown, and the welfare of his dominions."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Aberdeen rose</member> <membercontribution>in reply to the noble marquis. The question now started appeared to him to involve a very serious inconvenience, inasmuch as it intimately connected itself with the personal conduct of the sovereign. That was unavoidable, however studious noble lords might be to avoid it. For though it appeared a general and abstract proposition, it was calculated, at the same time, to serve as a justification of the conduct of the late ministers; and by justifying them, to insinuate blame in some other quarter. He could not but
<image src="S1V0009P0I0192"/>
<col>353</col>
consider the question as embracing two parties; the late administration, and the prerogative of the crown. It went to exculpate ministers: it could not go to exculpate the crown, to which no blame could attach. Indeed, it was very difficult, from the insulated manner in which the question was brought forward, nay it was impossible, to discuss it without recurring to other circumstances, which it did not purport to comprehend. When the late ministers consented to withdraw a bill which they deemed to be indispensably necessary to the safety of the country, they hinted that, in future, they might be under the necessity not only of reproducing the same measure, but perhaps some further measures of a similar nature. How could it be imagined his majesty could listen to such proposals, when it was known, perfectly well known, that the opinions of the sovereign upon these points were immutable? It might naturally occur to his majesty, that the same measure might be again proposed to him at a time when perhaps it might not be equally in his power to resist it. How natural then was it for him to demand an assurance from his ministers, that they would no longer think of any such measure; but that so far they would allow his feelings and his conscience to remain undisturbed? That assurance the late ministers refused to grant, and their refusal made it necessary for his majesty to dismiss them. Much had been said about secret advisers on this occasion, and it was contended, that the sovereign could do nothing without responsible advisers. This might be the case; but it was impossible to make that true which was false, or give existence to what no where existed. Would it be attempted to make the present ministers responsible for measures that were taken before they came into office? But if the measure for which it was wished to fix responsibility upon them referred to the late change of administration, he trusted the present ministers would not shrink from it; for it was the only line of conduct which the sovereign could, under such circumstances, adopt, consistently with his ease and dignity. The noble marquis contended that his motion was necessarily connected with the preservation of the constitution in its purity. He was as desirous as the noble marquis could be to vindicate that purity of the constitution, and therefore he should contend against putting any constraint on the free exercise of the prerogative, which, in his
<col>354</col>
opinion, was equally inconsistent with the purity of the constitution. On these grounds, he should move the previous question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Hardwicke</member> <membercontribution>expressed his deep regret at the change which had taken place in his majesty's councils, and lamented that a cry should have been set up which could only tend to revive religious dissensions, and produce the most deplorable consequences, and for which there was not the slightest reason arising out of the conduct of the late ministers. Those ministers, anxious, from the best motives of policy, that the whole population of the empire should be effective towards its defence, wished to extend the provisions of the bill passed in the Irish parliament in 1793, to this country. They afterwards found that if merely that measure was adopted, dissenters would be excluded from those privileges which were granted to Catholics; it was therefore deemed necessary to include dissenters, and open the army and navy to both classes. With respect to the act of 1793, he had understood, from what had been said by a noble lord (Buckinghamshire), who was then secretary in Ireland, that it was at that period intended to extend the provisions of the bill to this country, and that the bill itself was understood to extend to the navy. [The earl of Buckinghamshire said no, no.] He had understood that to be the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Buckinghamshire</member> <membercontribution>observed, that what he had stated, and which he was authorized at the time to state, in addition to the objects of the then intended bill with respect to Ireland, was, that it was the intention of his majesty's then ministers to propose a similar measure in this country; but certainly the bill of 1793 was not intended to extend, nor did he ever understand it to extend, to the navy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Hardwicke</member> <membercontribution>resumed. It had, he said, been the opinion of several able lawyers, that the bill did extend to the navy. The bill, however, which the late ministers introduced, was one which did not afford the slightest reason for that cry which had been raised against it; on the contrary, it was, in his opinion, a highly beneficial measure. The bill, however, was given up out of respect to his majesty's feelings upon the subject; and then a pledge was demanded from the late ministers, which he could not but consider as highly unconstitutional. He lamented the change that had taken place in his majesty's councils. Conceiving the late ministers to be much more adequate to the task of managing
<image src="S1V0009P0I0193"/>
<col>355</col>
public affairs, at a crisis like this, than the present; and agreeing also in the unconstitutional nature of the pledge demanded, he should on these grounds support the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Erskine rose</member> <membercontribution>and said: My lords, the particular situation in which I was placed in his majesty's late councils, as it regards the subject now under consideration, and the many public references which have been made in various places to my office and to my opinions respecting it, make it not unfit, I hope, that I should seek the earliest opportunity, consistently with the forms of the house, of delivering my opinion to your lordships.&#x2014;The opinions of men, my lords, upon this, as upon most other subjects, must be expected materially to differ; but there is one thing in which I am persuaded all men of honour must agree, i. e. that the case should be fairly stated, and that the question to be presented to the understandings of those who are to judge of any matter, be it what it may, should not be disguised or misrepresented. Many triumphs in large assemblies, and still more amongst large communities, have been obtained by artifice and imposture, but besides that they are most contemptible, they cannot possibly be lasting. Fact and reason must for ever prevail in the end.&#x2014;The circumstances which have given rise to this extraordinary conjuncture, though involved and complicated in their details, may be brought within a very narrow compass; within, I should think, ten minutes by your clock: yet without omitting any thing upon which a difference in the argument could ultimately be taken by any can did or reasonable man. I will state the matter to your lordships as I understand it; and as I was no party to the transaction, as nothing blameable, if there be blame any where, can possibly attach upon myself, I may at least be expected to be an impartial historian, and an historian too near the scene, to have gross ignorance or error reasonably imputed to me.&#x2014;My lords, it has been the fashion to represent the introduction of the bill into the house of commons, which led to the dissolution of the late administration as an extravagant act of political suicide; as a rash, useless, and wanton proposition, dictated by no expediency, and opposed by insurmountable obstacles, within the knowledge of those who introduced it. Nay, my lords, charges much more serious have been made. It has been more than insinuated, that, to overcome these obstacles, recourse was had to the
<col>356</col>
most unworthy deception and deceit. Nothing is more easy, my lords, for those who have an interest in such misrepresentations, to invent and propagate them; but it is not so easy to obtain credit for them in such a country and age as we live in. It is not easy to obtain belief (except in the surprise of the moment), that persons of acknowledged skill and ability as statesmen, should suddenly conduct themselves so absurdly, or that distinguished and characteristic integrity should suddenly give place to dishonour and falsehood.&#x2014;My lords, there is no foundation, no not the smallest, for either of the charges; though I readily admit that if statesmen ought to have no views but to preserve their places, they acted improperly. Your lordships very well know that in 1793, the remainder of that long volume of penal and disabling statutes which vexed the Roman Catholics of Ireland for so many ages, was extinguished by an act of great beneficence and wisdom of the king now upon the throne; an act which I trust to the manly and honest character of the Irish people always to remember, and the memory of which, I trust, will for ever induce them to impute only acts of grace and benevolence to his majesty, and resolutions of eternal exclusion to advisers who abuse their trusts. That act of 1793, which was an act only of the Irish parliament, threw open the whole bosom of civil and military establishment in Ireland to that immense majority of people; with certain exceptions, however, which, I have no doubt, under all the circumstances of that time, were just and reasonable; but which, nevertheless, could not but create great difficulties in the future application of any indulgences to be granted upon an union between the two kingdoms. I am speaking against myself, my lords, in this admission.&#x2014;The Irish act continued for 14 years without a single danger or disadvantage which can be stated, and several years had also passed since the union, without the extension of it to other parts of the empire. That extension, my lords, like almost all changes in human policy and government, was forced upon the consideration of the late ministers, not so much by the claims of the Catholics, as by the peculiar crisis in which they were called to the administration of public affairs. The crisis was alarming, and indeed, in every respect, unexampled. Amidst a series, however, of distressing events, a prospect suddenly seemed to open, of yet delivering Europe,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0194"/>
<col>357</col>
not only by rational combinations of her own powers against the common enemy to her repose and independence, but by balancing her conquests in the most distant parts of the world. But, unhappily, my lords, our population kept no pace with our other capacities for these grand and useful projects, except by bringing into action our whole national force. Our fleets and armies must long ago have failed, but from the great nursery of Ireland; and the great majority of Ireland was Catholic: catholic from all time, and not from any acts which our wisdom or prudence could controul or alter. This, my lords, was the consideration which led to the introduction of the bill which has raised such a clamour, and which has produced such consequences. It was to extend to England, now united with Ireland, the services of the Catholics in the defence of the whole empire, which his majesty, with the advice of the parliament of Ireland, had sanctioned, whilst it was an independent kingdom, which had been productive of so many advantages, and to which no objection was on foot any where. But difficulties stood in the way of the mere strict extension of that statute to Great Britain. The English Test act would have shut out the Protestant Dissenters, whilst the army and navy, from the effect of the extension, would have been laid open to the Roman Catholics. But what, I confess, struck my mind most forcibly, (though I was no party to any part of the measure,) was, that to open a profession to honourable men upon the principle of liberal trust and confidence, and yet to set up a bar against its highest honours and ambitions, was not only unjust, but, to the last degree, impolitic. In the mind of my most enlightened friend, at the head of his majesty's late councils, I know that this objection was so unsurmountable, that the bill was on that principle abandoned <i>in toto</i>, instead of being modified. It was therefore that the bill went beyond the Irish statute, though it was undoubtedly built upon the model of it, and it was so proposed to his majesty, and so offered to the house of commons.&#x2014;My lords, I purposely avoid the details, because I was no party to them; but I do not believe that any deception was practised; no such charge was ever made by the king; I know it never was. I am willing to argue the matter upon the footing of a misunderstanding, and, for argument's sake, to the utmost extent which has been or can be stated. What then?&#x2014;
<col>358</col>
the moment the misconception was discovered, was not the bill, in deference to his majesty, and in consequence of the misconception, immediately abandoned, and abandoned with the most honourable and a ectionate professions of attachment and respect? It has been asked in other places, upon what principle the abandonment could be justified, when the measure was professedly introduced upon the principle of expediency and duty? My lords, the answer is easy. There is a plain difference between even the strongest expediency and imperious necessity. The first was, all circumstances considered, not sufficient to make it such a point of duty, as to abandon the government rather than the measure; but the second would have rendered that duty absolutely indispensable; the course pursued, therefore, was surely unexceptionable. They abandoned the measure, but, to mark the principle of the abandonment, they expressed a reservation to govern themselves by future circumstances, in the advice which they might from time to time be called upon to offer to his majesty upon the subject. Without the reservation, the king might have considered, and would have been justly led to consider, his ministers as pledged not to resume the measure in question, nor any other measure of indulgence to the Catholics, though offered under circumstances which could not, from duty to his majesty, enable them to give way to his opinions: and the Catholics might also have been impressed with the same opinion, which, besides the utter dishonour of such a proceeding, would have led to the very discontents which the present conjuncture is so unhappily calculated to produce.&#x2014;My lords, I was not present when the minute in question was prepared; but if I had been present, I could have neither given assistance nor resistance, because I could not have assisted in drawing up a statement of what was intended by others, upon a subject on which my own views and opinions were different. But this I can declare, that though upon that ground I might have objected to the reservation altogether, yet I never should have thought of objecting to it, lest such offence should be given to the king by it, as to lead to a dissolution of the government, when I knew the measure had been, from dutiful deference to his opinions, and from the most affectionate personal considerations, wholly put aside and abandoned. Such an idea would have never presented itself to my mind, be-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0195"/>
<col>359</col>
cause it would have been inconsistent with the reverence and respect which I sincerely feel for his majesty, who could not, in my opinion, take just offence at the whole cabinet, because one minister or two had misconceived his sentiments. Their declarations were surely legitimate proof for the rest of his servants to act upon, and what more could they possibly do than unanimously to abandon the whole measure, when the misconception was discovered? By that abandonment, his majesty and his late ministers were brought back to the very situation in which they stood at the formation of the administration. They reciprocally knew each other's opinions. Sufficient for every day is the good or the evil of it. It was open to the ministers to propose, and for the king to reject, their propositions. If their duty had called upon them, on any future occasion, not to yield to his majesty, it would have been their duty to resign; and for the king to have removed them if they did not, instead of exposing the country, at such a crisis, to the serious consequences of a change, even though the change were for the better. I never, therefore, at the time the ministry was upon the eve of dissolving, could discover any just or rational ground for its dissolution; and I have never therefore been able to persuade myself, that their removal was the spontaneous act of the king on that account; because, having the highest opinion of his majesty's honour and fairness, I could not reconcile their removal with either. A pledge was tendered, which is not only not argued to be legal, but the illegality of which is considered as a childish truism, utterly unfit for debate in parliament; and yet this refusal, without farther parley or explanation, and in the midst of the most respectful and affectionate submission, (a large majority of the cabinet, not even chargeable with any misconception,) was made the only ground of a total indiscriminate removal; I say the only ground, because if the pledge had been taken, their continuance was of course; the king could not have gone back. Professing therefore the most sincere reverence and affection for his majesty, which I do really feel, and which I cannot help feeling, from every thing that I have seen and known since I have had the honour to be near his person, I do not believe that the ministry was dissolved by the spontaneous act of the king, on that single account. I believe that, independently of this, it must have been doomed somehow
<col>360</col>
or other to dissolution. That the king's opinions, and scruples, and feelings, were most honest, honourable, and conscientious, I most firmly do believe; but not that all that has happened was the unmixed result of them: and I cannot help thinking that, independently of the legal presumption, the king was advised, in the ordinary sense of the expression, in some quarter, or by some means or other, to remove his ministers. My lords, I do not mean to say, nor in the most distant manner to insinuate, for I never will insinuate what I am not prepared to assert, that any noble lord now present, nor any honourable man in any other place is to be considered as such adviser though he should upon his word declare, that he was not. I assure your lordships, that I have no such meaning, but still my belief upon this subject, such as I have described it, is not at all shaken. We all know, my lords, that in political life there are wheels within wheels, as many almost as in a silk-mill; that the smallest, and apparently the most insignificant, are sometimes, from their situations, the most operative, and that some of them are, besides, sunk so deep in the dirt, that it is very difficult to find their places, though one can very easily discover their tracks and their effects.&#x2014;My lords, I am the more inclined to be of this opinion, from the gross perversion and exaggeration of the danger and illegality of the extension beyond the Irish act of 1793. We have nothing to do with the civil exceptions in that act, but only with those which are military; these exceptions are the commander-in-chief, and general officers on the staff. His majesty consented, by the Irish act, to open the whole army to the Catholics, with these exceptions; and nobody charges his majesty now on that account with the breach of his coronation oath. It is admitted therefore, that, consistent with the coronation oath, Roman Catholics may be ensigns, lieutenants, captains, majors, and colonels in the army; but it is argued that they cannot rise to the rank of staff officers, consistently with the king's solemn obligation to support the Protestant establishment of the church of England. My lords, what in the name of wonder can the church have to do with this distinction? Whether it was or was not consistent with the spirit of the coronation oath, as it applied to the state, though not at all to the church, to open the army to the Catholics at all, it is not now open to argue; the thing is done, and was by his majesty consented to be extended to Great
<image src="S1V0009P0I0196"/>
<col>361</col>
Britain. We are therefore confined only to the mysterious enigma of the perjury, in carrying on their promotion to be officers on the staff. My lords, as I was no party at all to the bill, I cannot but feel a most natural anxiety to deliver myself from the possible imputation of such gross stupidity and folly as to have ever objected to it on that principle. I will state the foundation of my objection by-and-by. The question of entire emancipation is totally different, and ought not to be mixed with the present consideration. But I am quite sure that a man would be pointed at in the streets, who had incurred the ridicule of gravely asserting that, upon any possible view of the coronation oath, in its letter or in its spirit, the difference between colonels and staff-officers, could have any rational application. When it is considered upon the footing of expediency, the question may be very different; but even there, the king has the staff in his own hand; for though such promotions might be open to Catholics, the appointment still rests with the king himself. What I object to, therefore, my lords, is, that danger to the church is made the stalking-horse upon this occasion. As far as it is a question of political prudence, it is a fair and reasonable ground of difference of opinion; but so far as it is a clamour upon religion, it is imposture. It is for that reason that I cannot therefore help thinking, my lords, that this is a change, which though it could not have happened without the occasion, yet had not the occasion itself for its only cause, because the consequences altogether outrun such a cause. The objection to this way of considering the subject is, that it conveys a charge or an insinuation on the king himself. My lords, I deny it. It is the present ministers who make that charge upon his majesty, because they give up the pledge as illegal; they disavow it altogether; they deny that they have taken it, and leave it with the king. My lords, the obstacle of the king's oath appears the more extraordinary when we hear it in the mouths of the present ministers, who step into office upon the refusal of the pledge, by their predecessors. When one hears so much of the church, and upon an occasion with which the church can have no possible concern, one would think that the king upon his coronation took no oath but to support the religious establishment, and that the civil liberties of the people were nothing. My lords, does not the king solemnly swear to govern according to the statues of the realm,
<col>362</col>
and to the laws and customs of the same? My lords, the king enters into this solemn obligation: and is it consistent with the laws and customs of the realm to demand a pledge from counsellors that they will not impartially and honestly counsel? Is it consistent with the laws and customs of the realm, that the king shall make a rule for his own conduct, which his counsellors shall not break in upon, to disturb with their advice? Who is the man that will stand up and say, that this is the law and custom of this realm? The church therefore, and all observations concerning Catholics, are foreign to this grand consideration; because if this can be supported and sanctioned in one instance, it may in any number of instances; and the king, instead of submitting to be advised by his counsellors, might give the rule himself as to what he will be advised in, until those who are solemnly sworn to give full and impartial counsel, and who are responsible to the public for their conduct as his advisers, might be penned up in a corner of their duties and jurisdiction, and the state might go to ruin. But no doubt it will be said, that here again is a direct attack upon the king. I deny it again, it is no attack upon the king. I cannot see the king but in the responsible officers of state, who, by serving him in office, sanction all proceedings of the crown. The noble earl who spoke first on that side, declared that if an address was presented to the king to know the author of the supposed advice, his majesty would return for answer, that his adviser was the faithful monitor within his own breast in the suggestions of his conscience. My lords, the king might undoubtedly give such an answer, but I should be glad to see the ministers who would be bold enough to deliver such an answer to parliament. My lords, I will hazard my reputation as a lawyer with your lordships, that the responsible minister who was the organ of that message here, would be subject to an impeachment. The Great Hall, and not this chamber, would be the proper forum for the consideration of it. The king can perform no act of government himself, and no man ought to be received within the walls of this house to declare, that any act of government has proceeded from the private will and determination, or conscience of the king. The king, as chief magistrate, can have no conscience which is not in the trust of responsible subjects. When he delivers the seals of office to his officers of state, his conscience, as it regards the state, accompanies them. No
<image src="S1V0009P0I0197"/>
<col>363</col>
man in England, my lords, is less disposed than I am to abridge the king's prerogative, or to degrade the dignity of his high office, by reducing him to a cypher. The public, on the contrary, are entitled to the full benefit, nay, they have a right in reason to expect the advantages of the personal virtues and capacity of the king. Whatever follows from either is therefore his own. The fame and honour of his actions are his own; but as all men must have errors, the wisdom of our government turns them aside from him. The maxim, that the king can do wrong, does not seek to alter the nature and constitution of things, but to preserve the government not only against the impeachment of crime, but even against the irreverence and loss of dignity arising from the very imputation of it. No act of state or government can therefore be the king's; he cannot act but by advice; and he who holds office, sanctions what is done, from whatever source it may proceed. This, my lords, is not the legal fiction of the constitution, but the practical benefit and blessing of it. I am pleading the cause of the king and of the people together, in enforcing it; and I never will remain silent whilst this principle is disturbed. Apply it, my lords, to the case before us. We never should have recourse to a simile, when the case itself will serve us for illustration.&#x2014;My lords, the illustration may suffer from circumstances at this moment. The hands of our great enemy are full; the brave Russians keep him at bay in the East, and I pray God for the continuance of such critical successes. But should he return to the coast, and fill the shores of Europe with his troops from the Baltic to the Mediterranean; should he threaten Ireland with invasion, would any man be permitted with impunity to tell the Catholics that they must not look to any possible change in their condition during his majesty's reign? that no changes could relieve them whilst the king was on the throne? My lords, I maintain, without the hazard of contradiction, that this declaration would be a seditious misdemeanour, punishable by indictment. The criminal motive, unless as circumstances might repel the inference, would be inferred from the sentiment, because the king can have no such purpose either in law or in fact imputed to him. He cannot in law, for the reasons I have already given; and I believe he will not, in fact, under every possible circumstance, because the king's oath, and the danger to the establishments of church
<col>364</col>
and state, were opposed from time to time just as they are now, to all the important indulgences which his majesty, during his reign, has nevertheless granted to his Catholic subjects; and I conceive that I have even the sanction of the present ministers for supposing, that upon corresponding emergencies the indulgences would still be extended; for they say that they have taken no pledge, and consider the imputation of having taken it as a reproach, which it certainly would not be, if all further indulgences were against a fundamental and unalterable principle; and if further indulgences be not on that account inadmissible, but are to depend upon emergencies as they may occur, then upon what principle were the late ministers removed, and how are they distinguishable from their successors, since the late ministers abandoned all indulgence for the present, and only contended that emergencies ought to regulate their advice?&#x2014;This is the whole. I hope I have not departed in any thing I have said from the declaration I made the other day of my duty and attachment to his majesty, which is most sincere and affectionate. What weighs heavily on my mind, my lords, is, the dangerous and alarming distinction between putting by from time to time the claims and expectations of the Catholics, which I am as much disposed to as any man, and the public declaration of unalterable refusal upon a principle which admits no alteration. I trust we shall never see the danger of such a declaration brought home to a practical test in the discontent of subjects who might otherwise be affectionate and faithful.&#x2014;My lords, I have nothing to add to the trouble which I have already given to your lordships, but to assure you, that no man can be more deeply impressed than I am with reverence for God and religion, and for all the ministers and professors of the Christian Protestant faith. I am sure that I need not except even the worthy and excellent prelates in whose presence I make this solemn and public declaration. My lords, I glory in the opportunity of making it. Would to God that my life could be as pure as my faith! I consider the &#x00E6;ra of the Reformation, and its irresistible progress in the age which has succeeded it, as the grand &#x00E6;ra in which the Divine Providence began most visibly to fulfil the sacred and encouraging promises of the Gospel. I look forward, my lords, believe me I always have, with an anxiety which I cannot express, but with a hope which is unex-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0198"/>
<col>365</col>
tinguishable, to the time when all the nations of the earth shall be collected under its shadow, and united in the enjoyment of its blessings: It is that feeling, my lords, mixed perhaps with what may be considered as the prejudices of education, but which I cannot myself consider to be prejudices, that have kept me back from going the full length of Catholic expectation. I consider the Roman Catholic faith as a gross superstition, not chargeable upon the present generation, which contains thousands and ten thousands of sincere and enlightened persons, but the result of the darkness of former ages, and which is fast giving way under the hourly increasing lights of religious and philosophical truth. Not that vain and contemptible jargon which has usurped the name of philosophy, but the philosophy of nature, which lifts up the mind to the contemplation of the Almighty, by approaching to Him nearer, and discovering his Attributes in the majesty and harmony of his works. Toleration is the right of every man, and the policy of all wise states; but seeing that religious superstitions were falling into a wholesome and visible decline, I have never sought to give any encouragement to set them up again, but have rather wished that inconveniences should be felt, though no injustice suffered by their professors; because, when religious distinctions are not so importantly material as deeply to affect the conscience, they are often by imperceptible degrees diminished and melted away. These ideas, my lords, and not any objections affecting either the establishment of the church or the safety of the state, though formerly these were very solid objections, were my reasons for not giving my support to the bill without a more urgent occasion; for there are occasions to which such ideas ought to yield, since we are frequently without choice in the order and government of mankind. These opinions, however, can have no bearing on the present motion, the first branch of which I pass by altogether, having been myself an humble member of the administration which it supports; but I not only subscribe to the second, but shall conclude by returning my thanks to the noble marquis for having introduced it to the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Jersey</member> <membercontribution>supported the motion, which, he contended, was called for by the extraordinary circumstances that had recently occurred. That some farther concessions should be made to the Catholics,
<col>366</col>
had been the opinion of many statesmen of great eminence. Even one of the present ministers, the secretary of state for the foreign department, a person certainly not of inferior talents, had formerly held this opinion. It could not therefore be a subject of charge against the late ministers that they brought forward this measure wantonly or hastily. He thought there was great reason to regret the change in his majesty's councils, and he considered the pledge demanded as highly unconstitutional.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Harrowby</member> <membercontribution>began by observing, that he fell under the same embarrassment as the noble earl who had just spoken, from the want of proper documents. This deficiency was in itself a sufficient parliamentary ground for refusing to assent to the motion of his noble relation. No motion, he said, pretending to be grounded upon facts, ought to be entertained, unless it rests either upon facts notorious, or admitted on all sides, or proved by documents on our table. The nature of the present case admits of no such proof: it rests upon statements of the contents of dispatches which we have not seen; of the contents of confidential communications between the king and his cabinet, which are not, and cannot be before us: and upon the relation, not so much of the terms of confidential conversations between the same parties, as of the impression which such conversations made upon the minds of those who held them. Such are the documents on which we are called upon to assent to a motion, which, grounding itself solely upon the defence brought forward by one party, is in fact (though I trust not in intention) an accusation against the other; a motion which places your lordships in a situation, equally unknown to the theory and the practice of the constitution, equally alien from your legislative and judicial functions, the situation of sitting in judgment upon the personal conduct of your sovereign. I am well aware that the mention of his name within these walls is in itself disorderly, but the nature of this question renders it impossible to be avoided. More need not be said to prove at once the indecorous and unparliamentary character of the debate into which we are driven. I shall not however forget the doctrine laid down in another place by what is now the highest authority in this house, that the right which necessity creates, necessity limits. So far at least it will be agreed on all sides, that before we determine to assert an abstract proposition, for the declared
<image src="S1V0009P0I0199"/>
<col>367</col>
purpose of applauding the late ministers, and with the direct effect of censuring our sovereign, we ought to examine (as far as the imperfect lights we have can admit) how far that abstract proposition can be applied to the present case, considered in all its bearings and with all its circumstances. It would ill beome us, in any cause, much more in one so extraordinary in its complexion, so momenous in its consequences, to content ourselves with taking up the transaction nearly at its close. We must consider what were the steps which led to that close, what was the necessity which left no other issue. It is not enough to say, a pledge was demanded; no minister ought to give a pledge; the king has dismissed his ministers for refusing it; therefore the ministers were right, and the king was wrong. A mutual confidence between the sovereign and his servants appears so indispensable to the good conduct of public business, that when once there is so little confidence on either side, that the ministers are reduced to demand a pledge from their king, or the king from his ministers, there seems little option left, but for him to dismiss them, or for them to resign. What is the mode best calculated to preserve this necessary confidence? A clear and distinct explanation of proposed measures on one side, and an unreserved communication of opinions on the other. If ever there was a question upon which such clear and distinct explanation was peculiarly necessary, it was that lately in discussion. It was a question upon which the sentiments of a majority of his majesty's servants were known by themselves to be contrary to his; upon which his opinion had not only been repeatedly and decidedly declared, but had been acted upon by him under the most trying circumstances, and was founded not upon any arguments of political expediency, but upon a religious regard to the sacred obligation of his oath. If measures of concession to the Catholics had been consented to by the king, upon former occasions, with evident reluctance, arising from a conscientious fear lest they should pass the hallowed line, how deeply was it incumbent upon those, who proposed advancing but a single step within that limit, to define with the utmost precision the extent of that single step? Can we, who have heard little upon this subject, except the voluntary defence of ministers, can even they, who made it, now say, even to themselves, either that this caution was not necessary, or that
<col>368</col>
it was not neglected? Can they say, that in the first proposal to his majesty to extend the privileges of the Roman Catholics, the limits of that extension were accurately stated to him? were perhaps even accurately defined in their own minds. The measure was first proposed to be introduced by clauses in the mutiny bill. Could this by possibility go beyond the army, or include the navy? The notice of the intended motion referred, as I am informed, to the Irish act of 1793, and professed to admit Catholics to certain commissions. Could this be supposed to include the admission of all dissenters to all commissions and appointments? But what was the reasoning by which this proposal was supported, when addressed to his majesty? Am I misinformed, when I hear that he was told, that it was the earnest wish of ministers, to avoid every discussion, which could in the remotest degree be painful to any feelings, or repugnant to any opinion of his majesty? That this object they hoped they had attained by the measure then suggested: and why was it supposed to be attained? Because, so far from being repugnant to any known opinion of his majesty, it was perfectly conformable in principle to that concession which he had consented to in 1793; because it was only fulfilling the engagement which had been entered into under his majesty's authority at that time. Was it not stated, that the Irish act enabled the king's subjects in Ireland to hold commissions in the army, with no other restriction than is there pointed out? and that if a similar provision be refused with respect to this part of the united kingdom, it would (amongst orher arguments) bear an appearance of a conduct not consistent with openness and good faith? If this was the manner in which the proposal was represented, (and if it was not, I shall be contradicted,) can any man wonder at the impression made upon his majesty's mind? I will not argue against the cavil which may be made upon the reference to the principle of the act of 1793. It is answered at once by the proposal, after referring to the restrictions in that act, of a similar provision for England. Besides, what is the principle of an act? Is it not to be found equally in what it withholds, and what it grants? If it allows certain privileges for the relief of his Catholic subjects, does it not impose certain restrictions for the security of his Protestant establishment? Is it fair to argue, that the only
<image src="S1V0009P0I0200"/>
<col>369</col>
object of a legislative measure is to annihilate all distinctions between different sects, when it is an equally prominent object of the same measure to preserve a part of them? But, if we, who are left to collect our information as we can, find a want of precision in this clear and distinct explanation, how did it appear to those who were most conversant and most deeply interested in every part of the transaction? To the king, to whom it was proposed; to those ministers who were consulted upon it, or by whom it was advised; to those, through whom it was communicated to the Catholics? That it was not understood by the king, we have his majesty's own authority, as stated by the noble baron lately at the head of his ministry. That it was not understood by the cabinet, we have the authority of a noble viscount, and, as I am informed, that of two other members of the cabinet, who, if they had understood the measure, would, as well as himself, have dissented from it, and who, when they did understand it, took no part in the further proceedings. That it was not understood by the noble lord himself, who brought it forward in another place, we have his own authority, collected from his own notice, and from the manner in which his clauses were to be introduced. We are further told by that noble lord himself, that he had not sufficiently attended to the distinction between his own measure and the Irish act. The candour of this admission does honour to the noble lord; but it removes all our wonder, that others should not have understood what those who proposed it did not understand themselves; it removes also some of our regret, that the proposal of great measures is no longer vested in the same hands; it removes also much of our surprise, that in an intercourse of a confidential nature between the king and his servants, some precautions should have been thought absolutely necessary to prevent future misunderstandings. To the measure, however, thus stated, and thus understood, the king, after repeated instances, gave a reluctant consent, adverting, however, particularly to what had passed in 1793. Did he not also add, in precise and positive terms, that he thought it necessary to declare, that he would not go one step farther? If this cannot be denied, is it not a fact which ought to have been brought forward by those, who, in the defence of their own conduct, have forced us to discuss an accusation against the king?
<col>370</col>
Whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the line they should have followed after this declaration, this at least will be conceded, that it imposed upon them not only the duty of stating with the utmost distinctness what was the nature and the extent of the further steps which he was required to take, but of ascertaining, with the same distinctness, the nature and the extent of the consent of his majesty. Did the ministers perform this duty? Was it sufficient to rest such a point upon the understanding of a conversation, in which the king believed that he had signified his perseverance in refusal, but which the noble secretary of state understood as a reluctant consent, or, as he candidly admits, rather as not withdrawing the consent which had been originally given. The ministers being in possession of the written opinion of his majesty, giving a reluctant consent to a measure evidently limited, with a declaration that he could not go one step further, his consent to an unlimited measure is implied, from what? From the expression of his decided disapprobation. It ought not to be forgotten, that immediately after this conversation, an opportunity was offered, by the audience of the leading member of government, to clear up the doubt, while it was yet time. We understand from that noble lord, that nothing passed upon the subject. That the king should not have repeated his dissent, was perfectly natural. His determination not to advance one step beyond his former concessions, had been declared in writing; his dissent from the new step proposed, had, as he thought, been distinctly expressed to the person, whose immediate duty it was to conduct the measure: and he might well think it unnecessary to repeat it. But it would have been fortunate (and that it did not so happen must now be regretted by himself), if the noble person who had the second audience had felt that necessity for clearing up all doubts upon so delicate a point, which the very information he received at the door of the closet would to most minds have naturally suggested. Undoubtedly, however, it may be supposed that the information received by government from Ireland, placed the necessity of the measure every day in a stronger light, and afforded greater and greater hopes of quieting the Catholics. Will the ministers state this as a ground for enlarging the measure, or even for persisting in it? What hopes could be entertained of quieting the Catholics by a
<image src="S1V0009P0I0201"/>
<col>371</col>
limited measure, supported upon principles which required one unlimited, which made what was granted no favour, and left what was refused injustice and oppression? Did the Irish government give hopes that these concessions would keep back the petition? Was it not known, that, exclusive of the claims which that petition would bring forward, the previous requests, a compliance with which could alone give even a chance of keeping it back, were such as neither the Irish nor the English government were disposed to admit? Was not the meeting of the Irish Catholics, at which the petition was decided, a sufficient proof of the inefficacy of these concessions, even if the declarations of some leading orators had not spurned at their nullity? What then had happened? The clear and precise dispatch to the Irish government had been so well understood, that Mr. Elliott, though answering in the words of that dispatch, had given a doubtful answer; and that the Catholics, as was natural, were disposed to explain this doubt in their own favour. This favourable explanation was confirmed by the dispatch of the 3d of March, to which the consent of the king was implied, from the circumstance of his having returned without observation a draft which was sent to him without observation; and upon his consent, equally implied from the conversation above stated, in which the difference was explained, the measure in its new and extended form was pressed on in the house of commons. At length it became evident that the whole business had been involved in misconception. On the 13th of March, the majority of the cabinet, convinced that the king was immovable in his determination, communicated to him, through the medium of that noble lord, their resolution to modify the bill, so as to bring it within the limits of the act of 1793. With this resolution it appears that his majesty was satisfied. Why then was the whole bill abandoned? It would, it seems, have been difficult to find arguments to justify an adherence to the exact letter of the Irish act. Was there no difficulty then in finding arguments to justify the voluntary and entire relinquishment of a measure, stated by themselves to be indispensably necessary, and which they should be deeply criminal if they neglected to propose? If it could be done in the latter case (as the noble lord in another place has stated that it might) without committing his majesty, why not in the former? If it was necessary to com-
<col>372</col>
mit his majesty, was it not better to commit him upon a strict adherence to the act of 1793, and to carry their own principles into effect as far as that act carried them, rather than to abandon without necessity every part of their own measure, and to bring forward the sacred person of the king as the only bar to the progress of civil and religious freedom? If it were true that his majesty were himself the only supporter of those principles which seated his family upon the throne; if he feels himself bound by the obligation of an oath (not voluntary but imposed upon him as the <i>conditio regnandi</i>), to draw a line which he cannot pass, who is there but must respect such adherence to principle? Who is there but must wish such a conscience to remain unmolested? But is it true that his majesty is thus insulated from his parliament and his people? Did the ministers really believe that they should carry their bill in parliament? Has not one of their leading members in another place declared his opinion that they could not carry it there? After the late and decided opinion which your lordships have expressed upon the subject, was there a hope of carrying it here? Is there a doubt in the mind of any man as to the general sentiments and feelings of the country? Where was therefore the necessity of relinquishing the measure in a manner which gave a wrong impression of the real obstacles which opposed it? Still more, where was the necessity of accompanying the resolution to withdraw the bill with the stipulations contained in the minute of the 15th of March, as they have been stated by the noble lord? As to the right of expressing in parliament the individual opinions of members of the administration, it was a right which no man contested, and of which his majesty only regrets the exercise, because it appeared decidedly adverse to the great object of their exertions, the quieting the Catholics, and keeping back their petition. As to the right of giving such advice in future to his majesty respecting Ireland, as the course of circumstances might appear to require, this was a general right, upon which if they had been silent, no man would have entertained a doubt; but as applied to this particular question, what did it mean? After a long and distressing contest with their sovereign, they had discovered, what they might have known before it began, the ultimate point at which he was determined to make his stand. By relinquishing their
<image src="S1V0009P0I0202"/>
<col>373</col>
own bill entirely, instead of condescending to restrict it within the limits of the act of 1793, they had proved that any future proposal must go beyond that act. The power, therefore, which they thought it necessary to declare it was essential to their characters and to their duty that they should reserve, and from time to time exert, was a power to bring forward from time to time, for the decision of his majesty, measures to which his oath forbade him to consent. On this point, the king had decided, not lightly or inconsiderately. He thought himself bound to his Protestant people not to do any act, which was, in his own opinion, contrary to the pledge he had given them at his coronation; he thought himself bound to the Almighty, not wilfully to transgress the oath which he had sworn. However the arguments brought forward by others might convince the consciences of others, it was by his own conscience, right or wrong, that he must stand or fall. If he violated this sacred contract with his eyes open, with his judgement unconvinced, he must at once break his faith with man, and prevaricate with his God. Under these distressing circumstances, his majesty proposes to his ministers to withdraw this intimation of their intentions, Was this a concession which it was impossible for them to make? They had declared themselves desirous of keeping off the discussion of any question, contrary to the opinions and feelings of his majesty. By the exertion of their weight and influence in that direction, it was far from impossible that they might be successful. If they failed, it was still in their power to inform his majesty that, as they could no longer in their opinion administer his government, without proposing measures contrary to his sense of his oath, they must retire from responsibility, and leave his majesty to the advice of other counsellors. Having failed in convincing the king by the strongest statements of the indispensable necessity of the measure, which they had nevertheless abandoned, having consented to become deeply criminal by withdrawing what it would have been deeply criminal not to propose, from what further arguments could conviction and success be expected? What was the invariable prospect, but a fruitless and unaviling contest, productive of nothing but distrust and irritation? Are we then prepared to censure his majesty, if, after proposing in the first instance that the intimation should be withdraw, be claimed some positive assu-
<col>374</col>
rance that this contest between himself and his confidential servants should not last for ever? Having seen how loosely, how inaccurately a proceeding of such importance and delicacy had been conducted: having seen how easily his consent had been implied to the very measure to which he thought his dissent had been unequivocally expressed, can any man be surprized that he should require to be secured from all future apprehensions? From all future apprehensions, of what nature? Not that measures would be proposed to curtail his influence, or to abridge his power, but that he should be forced, against his conscience, to consent to the extension of his prerogative, Is it not clear that when there is so little confidence between the king and his confidential servants as to make it necessary on either side to require a pledge of any kind, the public service must suffer, if the conduct of affairs continues in the same hands? When ministers perceive that they have inconsiderately, and for what appear unnecessarily, brought themselves into this situation is it honourable to their sovereign, is it useful to their country, to cling to their official posts; to force their king to remove them, instead of removing themselves; and to attempt to gain popularity by dismissal which they must be conscious they have not gained by their administration? This brings me to the second branch of the motion of my noble relation. It was not expected by me, and it would require a long, but not difficult detail to answer it. Having been prevented by the state of my health from attending my duty in this place during their continuance in power, I can only form my judgement from a general view of their conduct. Of their entrance into office I say nothing, except that they chose to come in upon that very principle of exclusion, applied to a whole party from the highest to the lowest, a resistance to which principle, said to be applied to a single person, had been the declared reason of their refusal to join in a former administration. Of their actions I can only seize the prominent points in a hasty and imperfect review. I look for their &#x0153;conomy, to the immense burthen entailed, I fear for ever, upon the country, by the increased expence of the army, and consequently of the navy, incurred in order to try in the army upon a large scale an experiment grounded upon visionary theories, but which in practice the volunteering of the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0203"/>
<col>375</col>
militia into the line had proved to be almost hopeless of success. I look for their just distribution of offices and rewards; to their foreign appointments; to their civil promotion; to the persons whom they have placed in pecuniary trusts; to the persons whom they have prosecuted; to the persons whom they have pensioned. I look for their energy and ability in the disposal of the military and naval force of the country, to the expeditions they have sent out with so little delay in the dispatch, so little contradiction in the orders and counter-orders; to the conquests we have gained; to the victories we have achieved; to the stupendous advancement of our military and naval glory. For their talents in the management of foreign politics, I must look to the cordial footing on which we now stand with those powers in whose welfare we are most deeply interested; to the prompt and liberal succours they have sent to that remnant of Europe, which is still struggling for existence. For the wisdom and precision of their negotiations, I must look to their negociation with France; a perfect parallel to their negociation with their king, where the point on which the whole turned was left for months so clearly defined, that it rested at last upon the recollection of a verbal communication, which was understood by one party in one sense, and by the other in a sense directly contrary. I see nothing upon this review, which should induce your lordships to express, as you would do by agreeing to this motion, an implied or rather a direct disapprobation of that exercise of his majesty's undoubted prerogative, which you have upon former occasions stood forward to support. From my own personal feelings, I may regret much what has passed. I did not wish the fall of the late administration. It was strong; it was, or had been supposed to include sufficient ability; it contained in it some persons in whom I had been accustomed in other times to repose confidence; but I wished it either to be strengthened by the infusion of some better blood, or to be checked by an opposition sufficiently powerful to guard against undue exertions of the strength of government. On one ground indeed I may be permitted to regret their fall; on a consideration of the principles of the persons who opposed them. I knew them to be incapable of harassing or fettering any administration in the real discharge of its duties; incapable of taking advantage of ne-
<col>376</col>
cessary difficulties and burthens, to raise a clamour against them, which would aggravate those burthens and increase those difficulties. They would object to what they thought objectionable, and guard those principles which they could not desert without inconsistency, and which to them were sacred. Whether the experience of the last twenty years can give the present administration much hope of a similar opposition, it is for your lordships to consider. My temper is not sufficiently sanguine not to leave me, upon this ground, some regret for the past, and some apprehension for the future. With these feelings and these opinions, I cannot but have some regret at the addition made by this struggle to the dangerous pressure of the times. If the struggle were not necessary, it ought not to have been made. Having been made because it was necessary, it ought not to be abandoned. It is no child's play. The change is not the result of court intrigue, or party ambition. The present ministers have been called upon to support the king in the defence of his conscience. I approve their cause; I do not distrust their ability or their zeal. They will stand firm to him and to each other. With the sanction of your lordships, with the voice of the country in their favour, what have they to fear? But, be the event what it may, with their king they must stand or fall.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member> <membercontribution>declared, that the propositions contained in the resolution moved by the noble marquis had, in the abstract, his unqualified assent. He had no doubt of the principle, that a privy counsellor, who should restrain himself by a pledge, from advising his majesty to the best of his judgement, would be guilty of a high breach of duty. He was also satisfied, that the late administration possessed and deserved the confidence of the country. He did not mean to imply an unreserved approbation of all their proceedings; but he did not expect to see an administration of more than human perfection. The fair criterion, by which to judge the late administration was, to compare their conduct with that of others; and in this view he was ready to maintain, that considering the short duration of their power, they had accomplished, or put into a fair train of accomplishment, more important measures of public good, and that with less of reprehensible conduct, than perhaps any administration within our memory. He was also of opinion, that in the present state of Europe, the loss of a firm and stable administration
<image src="S1V0009P0I0204"/>
<col>377</col>
was an event deeply to be deplored.&#x2014;The question before the house, however, was not whether these principles were true, but whether it was proper, under all the circumstances of the case, for the house to record an opinion on the subject. The plain object and intention of the motion, was to convey a censure on the dismissal of his majesty's late ministers, as founded on an unconstitutional act; a censure in which he could not concur. The adoption of this motion, or of any other of a similar tendency, he considered as an unwarrantable interference in the exercise of the prerogative.&#x2014;The right of parliament, he said, to advise the crown upon the choice of ministers, cannot go so far as to entitle the house to question the motives of his majesty, for dismissing ministers who had lost his confidence. The king cannot be required to take advice from men, in whom he cannot confide; and, were there no other reason, a diminution of confidence is a sufficient ground for a change in his majesty's councils. If upon such a change, improper persons are substituted, it becomes the duty as it is the right, of parliament to state their opinion of the unfitness of the persons appointed: but it is on these grounds of expediency only, that they can recommend one set of men or reprobate another. It can never be maintained, that the king is accountable to parliament for his conduct in changing his advisers. Such a doctrine would sap the foundations of the constitution. If the motives for a change in his majesty's councils be a fit subject for parliamentary investigation, as well might the two houses proceed to the election of a ministry by a ballot.&#x2014;Except upon the principle here contended for, it would be impossible to prevent discussions, which are admitted on all hands to be utterly unfit for parliament discussions upon the personal conduct of the king, and on points at issue between him and his ministers. To illustrate this, let it be supposed, that the opposite principle were established, that the motives for a change of ministers are a fit subject of parliamentary enquiry; and then let an extreme case be put: let it be supposed, that a minister should in council offer a gross personal insult to his majesty, such as would be an unpardonable offence from one individual to another; would there be a doubt that such a minister, be his talents and his virtues what they may, might be properly dismissed? Now let the supposi-
<col>378</col>
tion be varied; instead of a gross insult, let us suppose an offence less unpardonable. The supposition admits of every possible gradation between the grossest insult, and the most venial inattention. Between the two extremes, cases may undoubtedly be imagined, in which it would be a matter of the utmost nicety to determine whether the offence were or were not a sufficient ground for dismissing a minister. If such questions as that are to be determined by parliament, where is an end of the improprieties into which it would lead; and how are such questions to be avoided, if the motives of his majesty for dismissing his ministers are to be held a fit subject of enquiry? When a change of administration takes place, on the ground of any great public measure, the propriety of the change becomes a fit subject of enquiry, as involved in the discussion of the measure which led to it. The present is not a case of that kind, but one of those in which there is no criterion to be referred to, except the feelings in his majesty's breast, excited by the personal behaviour of his ministers towards him.&#x2014;The measure, from which all this discussion originated, having been abandoned by ministers, is not the essential ground of difference, and therefore it is not at all to the purpose to enter into the merits of that measure. The whole question relates to the manner in which the measure was brought forward. As to the idea of the late ministers having had an intention to circumvent the king, I cannot see the least ground for such an accusation: but it is not equally easy to acquit them of very blameable carelessness, and of the want of a becoming attention to his majesty. The very existence of misapprehension on so important a point, would entitle us to presume carelessness; and the statements made to both houses of parliament, by members of the late administration, fully prove the fact. I cannot agree with some noble lords, who consider his majesty's determination on the Catholic question as immutable: yet when his opinion had been so often and so strongly expressed, the king had certainly a right to expect that a change in his opinion should not be lightly presumed, without a very full and distinct explanation. It appears, however, that ministers did imagine a change in his majesty's opinion, upon the most vague inferences; and proceeded to act upon that supposition with a levity that would scarcely have been becoming on a subject
<image src="S1V0009P0I0205"/>
<col>379</col>
of the most trifling consequence. This conduct may fairly be considered as an act of personal inattention to the king, requiring an apology: and when an apology might have been expected, his majesty received what, without any disposition to exaggeration, may be construed into a defiance.&#x2014;When the late ministers subjoined to the minute of council, in which they agreed to withdraw the Catholic Army bill, the reservations which have been the occasion of so much comment, it may be granted to them, that they had no disrespectful intention: yet, if they did not take sufficient care to explain themselves they have no right to complain that their expressions were misunderstood. The king had said nothing which appeared to call for these reservations. The act, to which they were annexed, did not imply the admission of any principle, to the contrary. The noble and learned lord, lately on the woolsack, has himself stated, that the deference of ministers to the king in the present circumstances did not imply that they must shew the same deference in others of more extreme urgency. If circumstances should hereafter have arisen, such as to render the Catholic concessions a measure of indispensable necessity, without which the affairs of the nation could not be carried on, it would have become the duty of ministers to state it to his majesty as a measure without which they could no longer remain in office; and it is altogether ridiculous to suppose that they would have been precluded from this conduct, because they had on a former occasion relinquished a similar measure, at a time when it was to be considered as expedient and useful, but not of vital importance and absolute necessity. The insertion therefore of these unnecessary reservations might fairly be considered as a threat to renew the subject under circumstances of no greater necessity than the present. This interpretation is confirmed by the expression, that the advice alluded to, was to be submitted from time to time; an expression which cannot easily be limited to those cases of impending destruction to which it is now construed as applying.&#x2014;Whatever might be the meaning affixed by the council to these expressions, it is certainly no extravagant supposition to imagine that the king may have considered them as a disrespectful defiance, and as such, a sufficient ground for the immediate dismissal of his ministers. This, however, he did
<col>380</col>
not resolve upon, but conveyed to them an expression of his willingness to overlook the conduct, of which he had a right to complain, provided he could be assured that he should not meet the like in future. Such appears to be the obvious spirit and intention of that note from the king, which is described as the demand of a pledge from his ministers. Though in form, that note does demand a pledge, such as ministers could not constitutionally accede to, yet it is to be considered, that this was a paper, dictated on the spur of the moment, and in which we are not to look for the accuracy of a special pleader. The spirit of it is essentially friendly to ministers, and implies a reluctance, on the part of his majesty, to part with them, totally irreconcileable with the idea thrown out by a noble and learned lord, that it must have been dictated by secret advisers, and founded on a previous resolution to dissolve the administration.&#x2014;It appears, then, that the dismissal of the late ministers may be fairly traced to the circumstances of their personal conduct towards his majesty; and in this view of the matter, no one will consider it as a proper subject of parliamentary investigation, whether these circumstances were or were not of sufficient weight to induce his majesty to that determination. The noble lords on the opposite side, however, abstracting altogether from those emotions and feelings, from which the royal breast can no more be exempt than those of other men, overlooking all the circumstances, which provoked the ultimate demand of a pledge, consider the subject as a dry and insulated constitutional question. It would have been unconstitutional, they say, for ministers to have given the pledge required, and therefore it was unconstitutional to demand it; and if this act was not owing to a secret adviser, the new ministers who accept offices, vacated in consequence of that unconstitutional demand, must be held as assuming the responsibility.&#x2014;The principle, that a new ministry are responsible for the dismissal of their predecessors, and retrospectively for the measures upon which it proceeds, I hold to be sound constitutional doctrine, but the application, which is made of that principle to the present case, appears to me to be fallacious.&#x2014;That the king can do no wrong, and that he can never act without advice, are principles of constitutional law, which, like many other doctrines of the law of England, are expressed in figurative language, like all those
<image src="S1V0009P0I0206"/>
<col>381</col>
principles which juridical writers express under the form of fictions. These maxims, stripped of their metaphor, and translated into plain language, appear to me to mean: 1st, that the king has no power, by the constitution, to do any public act of government, but through the medium of some minister, who is held responsible for the act: and, 2dly, That the personal actions of the king, not being acts of government, are not under the cognizance of law.&#x2014;The principle that the king can never act without advice, applies therefore only to acts of government. This interpretation is quite sufficient for the purpose, which that maxim is intended to effect, viz, to secure the people from the abuses of bad government, through the restraint which the fear of responsibility may put on ministers. If this responsibility attaches on every act of government, on every act of the king in his executive or legislative capacity, the people have all the security, which that maxim can impart; and it would be absurd to extend it to the personal actions of the king as an individual, to the occurrences of his domestic life, or to the circumstances which may arise in the course of confidential communication between him and his ministers, previously to their determining on any measure, which is afterwards to make its appearance to the public as an act of government.&#x2014;Upon a change of ministry, the new ministers are undoubtedly responsible for the dismissal of their predecessors as a public act of government; and where the dismissal is connected with any other public measure, on that likewise, retrospectively, they become responsible for the negative of their predecessor's intentions, but not for any private consultations, between the king and his former ministers, which did not terminate in any public measure. In the present case, the demand of a pledge from the late ministers, cannot be considered in any other light than as an occurrence of private consultation in the cabinet; an occurrence which cannot be a proper subject of parliamentary enquiry, since it is only in consequence of the king's permission that the knowledge of the fact could ever have come to parliament. That permission was granted for the sole purpose of enabling some of his late ministers to clear their characters of aspersions thrown upon them, and it is surely a most improper trespass upon the generosity which led to that permission, that a proceeding, such as the pre-
<col>382</col>
sent, should be founded upon it; a proceeding which, however it may be intended by the noble persons who bring it forward, cannot be debated without a continual infringement of that important constitutional maxim, that the personal actions of the king are not to be made the subject of discussion.&#x2014;Upon the whole then it appears that the argument in favour of the present motion rests entirely upon the gross fallacy, of considering the demand of a pledge from ministers as an insulated fact, and their refusal as the only assignable motive for dismissing them. It appears on the contrary, that, independently altogether of any such refusal, the dismissal would have been justifiable; that, before the demand was made, circumstances had occurred which might naturally and fairly have led to that dismissal. If upon receiving that minute of council, by which his ministers agreed to give up the Catholic bill, the king, instead of requiring that the reservations should be withdrawn, had immediately and without further explanation, sent for the seals of office, could any one venture to say that the act would have been unconstitutional? and shall we be told that the act which the king might constitutionally have done before the demand of a pledge, became unconstitutional after that demand was refused? that the mere circumstance of the king's having inadvertently made a demand, which his ministers could not with propriety accede to, can be sufficient to annul and bar the exercise of one of the most essential prerogatives of the crown? The noble lord proceeded to state, that the avowed object of the motion was to lead to the re-instatement of the late ministers. However much he might regret that a change should have taken place, it could by no means follow that he should concur in machinations for forcing back upon the king any set of men who had lost his majesty's confidence. He argued that no practical good could ever arise from such a proceeding, even if it should succeed; that a ministry forced upon the king without his cordial approbation never could be secure; that the only consequence would be to multiply changes; and that every change necessarily involves much inconvenience to the public service. He agreed, that it was of peculiar importance in the present circumstances of Europe, that we should have a strong and stable administration. Such, undoubtedly, the late administration was; and on this ground,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0207"/>
<col>383</col>
among others, he regretted the change: but, though the late administration was I strong, it was by no means to be inferred that, if re-instated, it would be equally strong. The strength of an administration depends in a great measure on the opinion, which the public entertains of its permanence. Before these unfortunate transactions, the late administration was universally supposed to be immovably stable. Such an opinion can never be renewed. They formerly possessed the confidence of the king and the country, united; now, they would possess neither: for, whatever sense the public may entertain of the great and splendid abilities of the late ministers, the confidence formerly reposed in these talents, must be greatly shaken by a view of the extreme indiscretion of their late proceedings.&#x2014; Lord Selkirk further observed, that, in the present circumstances, he could not approve or concur in a systematic opposition to an administration, whose conduct is as yet unknown. He thought them entitled to a fair trial, and that they should not be condemned till their measures should prove them unworthy of confidence. It is true, that many individuals of the present administration are well known as public characters; but, as a government, they are a new combination of men, and as yet untried. He could not deny, that many members of the present cabinet had expressed opinions on various subjects, which he did not concur with; and that, from a view of their former conduct, he could not avoid feeling considerable anxiety and doubt, as to what their future conduct might be: but he could not carry this so far as to say that they should be excluded, as utterly unfit to be trusted. Notwithstanding the opinions which some of them had delivered, against measures which he highly approved, he trusted they would see the wisdom of the maxim which their predecessors had acted upon in coming into office, that, taking into consideration the unavoidable mischief of repeated changes, they ought to acquiesce in many things which they found established, notwithstanding their having objected to them when first enacted. He referred particularly to the measures adopted last session for the improvement of our military system, the spirit of which he trusted would be still adhered to. It was also alledged, that the new ministers were pledged to a system opposite to that of conciliation in Ireland. He could not how-
<col>384</col>
ever perceive how they could fairly be considered as under any such pledge, and he trusted they would take the earliest opportunity of evincing the contrary, by giving to the Catholics, not merely assurances, but practical proof, that, however they might resist further concessions, they were determined to execute in a liberal manner, the laws already enacted in their favour. Such a conduct, he was persuaded, would not only be more honourable, but of more advantage to the new ministers, and tend more to promote the stability of their power, than if they should go on to encourage religious animosity, and to excite apprehension in the public mind for the safety of the ecclesiastical establishment. By raising a cry of no popery!, they might gain the assistance of a wild and fanatical mob, but would excite the disgust and reprobation of every honest and sensible man in the kingdom.&#x2014;Lord Selkirk proceeded to state, that those who, in the present circumstances, do not approve of the avowed principles or former conduct of the newly appointed ministers, are by no means reduced to the alternative of joining with the determined partisans of the late ministers in a systematic opposition; that there is an intermediate line of conduct more honourable, more constitutional, better in every respect; that of giving an independent but qualified support to government so long only as their measures are reconcileable with the main and essential objects of national safety. In times like the present, a systematic opposition, maintained by so powerful a party, must tend to embarrass the operations of government, and to waste, in the struggle for power, that strength which ought to be directed against the common enemy. Such proceedings may be fit for those, whose interests are involved in the re-establishment of any particular individual at the head of administration: but those who are sensible of the imminent danger of our situation and whose primary object is that national safety in which our all is involved, will not be inclined to join the violent partisans of either side of the house. If a few persons of acknowledged character, would unite in an independent line of conduct, they must gain the confidence of the people; though their numbers might at first be small, every thing they might say would carry weight, and even a small phalanx of such men might be able to repress ebullitions of a factious spirit, whether it should ap-

<p><member>Lord Boringdon</member> <membercontribution>said, he thought the resolution proposed was much too vague and indefinite, and as such he should, before he sat down, make a motion for the purpose of getting rid of it without coming to any resolution on the subject. The latter part of it, he thought, was a kind of surprise on the house, and he was of opinion that none of it was called for by any circumstances which could induce the house to come to any resolution. It was in his mind a proposition which their lordships ought to entertain with much caution, as it related so very nearly and particularly to the personal conduct of the king. A pledge had been required from his majesty's late ministers, respecting the bringing forward a particular question; and it had been assumed that the present ministers had entered into some such pledge. He believed, however, from the declaration of the noble secretary of state below him, that no such pledge had been given by the present ministers. Indeed, there could be no occasion for asking it, for they had never shewn themselves favourable to the Catholic question. He was also adverse to the proposed resolution on another ground. He did not think it would be binding on the house. Their lordships would recollect, that in the reign of queen Elizabeth, that house came to a resolution, while at war with Spain, that the country should make no peace with a prince of the house of Bourbon; yet the queen and her ministers made peace very soon afterwards, and the resolution of the house was so much waste paper, and no more. He was ready to absolve the late ministers from the imputation which had been charged upon them, of having attempted to force on the king any measure that militated against his feelings or his conscience; but he could not absolve them from negligence and inattention in the mode in which they had conducted themselves. He adverted particularly to the uncertainty and ambiguity contained in the Irish dispatch, and thought them blameable in endeavouring to obtain his majesty's opinion through the medium of a draft of a dispatch. He thought if the noble lord at the head of the late administration had openly and candidly communicated directly with his majesty on this important and delicate subject, the late misunderstanding could not have happened. As to the pledge, about which so much had been said, he would ask, whether, under all the circumstances which had been stated, it was very extraordinary the king should require such a security to his peace of mind,
<col>386</col>
and to the dictates of his conscience, after the representation which had been given in by the late ministers; and that, after a refusal of such pledge, his majesty should be desirous and anxious to look for other servants who would not treat him in a similar manner. What did the late ministers say respecting this pledge? Why, that it was not fit to be given; they introduced therefore the reservation, as a sort of counterpoise, and by so doing made it in some degree incumbent upon his majesty to call to his councils other men, with whom he could act more in unison. It had been more than insinuated that this change had been brought about by secret advisers. It did not, however, appear by the statement made by the noble lord (Grenville) before the recess, that even the smallest insinuation could ever be made that the king had acted in this matter by the advice of any person whatever. Much had been said as to the effects this would have on the Roman Catholics of Ireland: he hoped, however, that when that body of men reflected on the many disabilities which had been removed by the gracious favour and condescension of his present majesty, who had, from the commencement of his reign, shewn himself desirous to act as far as possible for their relief, they would remember his gracious regard to their situation, and would not be angry when they saw their complaints were not set aside from any cabal, but that they would accordingly conform themselves in such a manner, as to evince they had a true sense of their own case, and were convinced that no intention remains in his majesty but to maintain the oath he had taken at his coronation. Feeling that the motion included a personal inculpation of the king for the exercise of an undoubted prerogative, he could by no means assent to it, and would therefore conclude by moving, that the house do now adjourn.&#x2014;The question having being read from the woolsack,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Kinnaird</member> <membercontribution>said, he was both surprised and sorry to hear the sentiments expressed in the noble lord's speech, but more particularly the latter part of it, in which he said that the Catholics would not be angry when they saw their complaints were not attended to from any intrigue or cabal, but that they must solely attribute it to the will of his majesty. This, he thought, was not the happiest way of reconciling that large body of men to the opposition made to their claims, or of conciliating their affections, which had been weakened by repeated disappointments. The noble lord had told their lordships, that he objected to the resolution, be-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0209"/>
<col>387</col>
because it would not be binding; and he had quoted an instance of a resolution passed by the house about two centuries ago, that they would not make peace with a prince of the house of Bourbon, though the queen and her ministers did very soon after make peace with a prince of that house. He did not see how this applied at all to the present case, or why, if a resolution of former times had been departed from, and thereby rendered of no avail, the house should not, at a subsequent period of time, pass any resolution which a present case might require. The noble lord then addressed himself to the earl of Selkirk, and expressed himself truly and sincerely sorry to perceive that noble earl had become so easy a convert to the support of his majesty's present ministers; and that he had exerted those talents, for which he had so great a respect, in calling for the confidence of the house, on the ground that those new ministers were untried. Much as he respected the noble earl, and highly as he valued his talents, he could not, however, agree with him in that particular, of their being untried. If he looked to the noble duke at the head of the present administration, no one could say he was untried. He had been in repeated administrations, none of which had effected any very great advantages to the country during their continuance. If he looked to the noble secretary of state for the home department (lord Hawkesbury), he too well knew the effect his former diplomatic conduct had had on all our allies, to draw any very favourable conclusions from it; and that if it did not assume a more favourable aspect, it could not fail to merit all the wit and humour which his right hon. colleague, the present foreign secretary, (Mr. Canning,) had then so profusely bestowed on it. If he looked to the noble lord at the head of the war and colonial department, (lord Castlereagh,) he had given such striking specimens of the versatility of his genius, that he might safely be set down as a fostering, careful, and attentive guardian, to whom we might, without risk, commit the care of the virtue and talents of the present administration. A noble lord, who had spoken last but two, speaking of the talents of the late ministers, had asked, in a kind of triumphant tone, what "All the talents " (as the late administration were called) had done for the service of the country. He, for his own part, thought the question might be readily answered, and that highly to the credit and honour of the late administration. In point of economy, he had ever found them ready to listen to all persons who
<col>388</col>
were desirous and capable of pointing out any retrenchments. In regard to dispatch of business, he had seen none equal to them, for they had brought the public business to a degree of forwardness that was unexampled. That noble lord had also talked of expeditions planned by the late ministers. He was, however, the last person in the world who should talk of expeditions to the continent, when he recollected and maturely considered the mad expedition to which he had been himself a party; but on the subject of expeditions, he would tell the noble lord, that if one of the greatest powers on the continent, if Turkey were at this moment at the feet of this country, such a glorious event was owing to the wise, politic, and spirited measures of the late administration. He could say the same as to Monte Video; and he greatly feared the next thirteen months would not be marked by any such splendid and important acquirements, from the combined talents and wisdom of the new and untried ministry. He was extremely sorry to find that attempts had been made to rouse the efforts of bigotry and superstition, and to re-kindle the flames of religious animosities. If there were those now in being who would carry those baneful and destructive passions into the very bosom and seats of learning, and would wish to revive the brilliant exploits of the dark and barbarous ages, let the effects to be produced by them rest on their own heads. This, he believed, was the first time that secret advisers of the king had brought on the downfall of an administration which enjoyed the confidence of the country, since the time of that great statesman lord Chatham, who had declared, that there was a power behind the throne, greater than the throne itself. Yet before his administration was in a similar manner overturned, that great and immortal character had laid the foundation of drawing into the service of the country a large body of the subjects of the state, against whom as many and as violent prejudices existed as did now against the Catholics of Ireland. During a long time antecedent to his glorious administration, the war-whoop and cry of the country had been loudly and constantly raised against the jacobites in the north of Scotland. When that illustrious statesman came into office, he found the army in a state of decay&#x2014;and how did he raise it? Not by fomenting the prejudices which were then so prevalent, but by calling those very jacobites into the service. He from their ranks recruited the ranks of the army: and a braver or more loyal set of men never fought with more energy and constancy the battles
<image src="S1V0009P0I0210"/>
<col>389</col>
of their country. Such, he had no doubt, would be the case of the Catholics of Ireland, if confidence were placed in them, and opportunities given them to shew their gratitude and attachment. For their endeavours to effect this great national purpose, he considered the late ministers as entitled to the highest praise, and as such the present motion had his hearty support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>said, that the motion of the noble baron had relieved him from a considerable degree of difficulty. He could not have concurred in giving a negative to a resolution which expressed regret at the late change in his majesty's government, and which also stated the impropriety of acceding to any pledge, that might fetter the conduct of ministers in the discharge of their public duty. To the previous question he should have objected, because he was of opinion, that such a proposition as that brought forward by the noble marquis (Stafford) ought not to be entertained under any circumstances; and it therefore appeared to him, that the proper mode of disposing of it, was by a vote of adjournment.&#x2014;The resolution proposed by the noble marquis must be considered as arising out of the discussion which immediately preceded the Easter recess, and the renewal of it only served to increase the regret which he had felt at the time, and ever since, that such a discussion should have taken place. Every allowance was however to be made for the situation and feelings of the noble baron (Grenville), by whom the explanation had been then given. The circumstances, which occasioned it, were new, and extraordinary: a mutilated extract of a cabinet minute had appeared in a public paper, even previous to the change of government; and no efforts had been spared to place the conduct of the noble baron in the most unfavourable light.&#x2014;These circumstances were sufficient to account for, even if they did not fully justify, the steps which he had taken in his own vindication. But, whatever might be the cause in this particular instance, it must be admitted to be highly desirable and important, that such a proceeding should not be drawn into precedent. Some of the consequences of it already began to be seriously felt. Their lordships were now called upon to vote a resolution, founded on alledged facts, to be collected from a speech, delivered on a former occasion, of which, consistently with the privileges of that house, there could be no existing memorial;&#x2014;but without any
<col>390</col>
record on their journals, or any document on their table; in fine, without such a basis as the house would require to sustain a proceeding even on an occasion the most unimportant. As, however, certain particulars had been stated, it was indispensably necessary that they should be fully detailed and correctly understood, in order that the transaction to which they applied, might be placed in its true and proper light. Under this impression, he relied on the patience and indulgence of their lordships, whilst he laid before them such information as appeared to him to be material for this purpose; which however he should not presume to do, without the sanction of that authority, under which the noble baron (lord Grenville) had himself addressed them on a former day. [Lord Sidmouth was here interrupted by the earl of Radnor; who objected to his lordship's proceeding in the detail upon which he appeared to be entering, as being irregular in point of order, and not to be justified even by the permission to which lord S. had alluded. His lordship said he should have given the same interruption on a former occasion, if he had been present when similar topics were first introduced by a noble baron, lately at the head of the government.] Lord Sidmouth replied, that, whatever might have been the objection to the agitation of this question in the first instance, which he felt, and had before expressed; he could not but throw himself on the justice and impartiality of the house, to be allowed the same indulgence, which others had experienced, whilst he endeavoured to state such circumstances, as came within his own particular knowledge, and which, he thought, were absolutely necessary to the right understanding of the transaction; professing at the same time, that he was not apprehensive that he should have occasion to disclose any thing which would not be sanctioned by the allowance he had received, consistently with the obligation under which he had acted, as a confidential adviser of the crown. He then proceeded to state, that the noble baron had asserted on a former day, that, up on his entrance into office at the commencement of the last year, no declaration, or pledge had been required of him on the subject of the Catholic question; of this he could entertain no doubt: and he further owed it to that noble lord, and to those of his colleagues who concurred with him(lord G.) in opinion on that subject, to declare, that he believed it to have been their earnest wish
<image src="S1V0009P0I0211"/>
<col>391</col>
and fixed intention to avoid any discussion of it, or of any topics connected with it, as far as it could be done consistently with what appeared to them to be due to their own character and to their conscientious sense of public duty. As to himself, he had at the period when the late administration was formed, and at his first interview with the noble baron, and with a right hon. gent. now no more, (Mr. Fox,) strongly expressed his hope that the subject would not again be agitated in parliament, and he had stated distinctly, that, if it should be brought forward, as his sentiments upon it did not depend on feelings, and opinions, entertained in any other quarter, or on circumstances which were temporary, no consideration should prevent or controul his determined opposition to it.&#x2014;During a period of more than 12 months, nothing occurred which indicated a probability that the Catholics in Ireland were disposed to press the agitation of the question in parliament: but soon after the commencement of the present year, it because too probable, that their quiet forbearance was temporary, and that it was only by fresh concessions that their dissatisfaction could be restrained from venting itself in the form of petitions to the legislature.&#x2014;At a meeting of his majesty's cabinet at earl Spencer's, on the 9th of Feb. various expedients which had been suggested for allaying this sort of irritation, were discussed, without being finally approved: a dispatch, however, to the lord lieutenant was produced by the noble lord at the head of the government; which, from a misconception of the objects, that it appears to have been intended to embrace, gave rise to those embarrassments that ensued, and which ended in a change of ministers. That dispatch, and the reasoning by which it was recommended, appeared to him, and to other members of the cabinet, to refer exclusively to three objects, to which the attention of ministers was called, as was then stated by considerations of policy, good faith, and consistency. His majesty having been empowered, by the Irish act of 1793, to grate military commissions to his Roman Catholic subjects, in Ireland; it was deemed necessary from the considerations above stated, first, that persons holding commissions under the authority of that act, should not become liable to penalties, if called upon to serve in Great Britain: secondly that there should be secured to Roman Catholic officers, and soldiers, the same toleration in the exercise of their religion
<col>392</col>
which was afforded to all other classes of his majesty's subjects: and thirdly, that the capacity of holding military commissions, which was conferred by the Irish act, should be extended to his majesty's Catholic subjects in this part of the united kingdom. Such a measure was stated to derive importance and urgency from the circumstances of the times, which called for the united zeal and strength of the whole population of the empire, to enable it to cope with the immense military power, and insatiable ambition of the enemy.&#x2014;Much stress was also laid upon intimations given in the year 1793, by lord Clare in the Irish house of lords, and by Mr. Hobart, now lord Buckinghamshire, then chief secretary to the lord lieutenant, in the house of commons, of an intention on the part of the English government, to propose to the parliament of this country a measure, similar to that which was adopted in Ireland; but though Mr. Pitt's administration continued 8 years from that time, no such measure was brought forward, and though he had since been 5 years in office with his noble friend the earl of Buckinghamshire, he had never heard of this supposed pledge till the present occasion. It had however been explained by his noble friend on a former night, in a manner which had materially weakened, if not destroyed the argument, which was founded upon it.&#x2014;when this dispatch was first under discussion, he had stated explicitely that he would not agree to any new concession, and that if it was a question whether the king should now, for the first time, be empowered by law to grant military commissions to his Roman Catholic subjects, he should entertain strong doubts of the expediency and policy of such a measure; but it appeared to him that there was no alternative but to repeal the Irish act, or to go the length proposed; and it was upon this ground, and to the extent of this act only, that his concurrence had been given.&#x2014;The dispatch was sent to the king at Windsor on the evening of the 9th, and returned on the following day with a note expressing his majesty's disapprobation of the measure which had been recommended; and "the hope he had entertained that the subject would not again have been agitated." In the evening of the 10th, another cabinet meeting was held; at which a minute was prepared, describing in terms the most respectful, the precise ground on which his majesty's servants deemed it incumbent
<image src="S1V0009P0I0212"/>
<col>393</col>
upon them to solicit his majesty's permission to propose to parliament a clause, to the effect before stated, to be inserted in the mutiny bill, then pending in the house of commons; with ut adverting, however, to the expediency of repealing the exceptions in the Irish act, or of extending the measure to the naval service. To this minute of cabinet, which was communicated to his majesty, not by himself (lord S.), as had been erroneously supposed, but by the secretary of state, no answer was returned the next day; but a council being then held at the Queen's palace, he had previously to it, at an audience on the business of his office been questioned by his majesty on this subject; when he informed his majesty, that he had been induced to concur in the proposed measure, as a necessary consequence of the Irish act of 1793, from the consideration of which, combined with the act of Union it appeared to him that there was no alternative but the repeal of the Irish act, or the adoption of this measure. His majesty declared, that he could not consent to any new concession, but that, in consequence of the Irish act, and on that account alone, he would take the proposition of his cabinet into further consideration, and return an answer on the following day.&#x2014;The answer stated, that, "however painful majesty had found it, to reconcile to his feelings the removal of objections which may have the most distant reference to a question, which had already been the subject of such frequent and distressing reflection, he would not, under the circumstances, in which it was so earnestly pressed, and adverting particularly to what took place in 1793, prevent his ministers from submitting, for the consideration of his parliament, the propriety of inserting the proposed clauses in the mutiny bill. Whilst, however, the king so far reluctantly conceded, he thought it necessary to declare that he could not go one step further."&#x2014;Hence it appeared evident, that his majesty conceived the proposition to be grounded entirely on the act of 1793; and to have no other object than that of extending its operation to Great Britain. This, as he had before stated, was the light in which it had been regarded, not only by himself, but by other members of the cabinet. By the lord chancellor it had been described to his majesty on the 11th of February, as nothing more than a corollary from that act; and in this view of it, lord Howick, on a subsequent day (Feb. 20),
<col>394</col>
gave notice to the house of commons, of his intention to propose some additional clauses in the mutiny bill. In that light it was so far understood by Mr. Elliott, the secretary to the lord lieutenant, that he made his communication to the Catholics accordingly, and referred to the government at home a question which had been put to him at a meeting at Dublin, whether it was intended to repeal "the limitations of the act of 1793, and render Catholics capable of holding the situations of commander-in-chief, master-general of the ordnance, and of generals on the staff?"&#x2014;It must also be observed, that the dispatch, according to the terms in which it was conceived, was, strictly speaking, applicable to no other than this limited construction. It proposed to give to the Catholics a competency to "hold any military commission whatever:" but military offices, excepted by the act of 1793, are not understood as being held under military commissions: and it is remarkable, that, in the clauses which it was intended to insert in the mutiny bill, the words, "or appointments" were added to the word "commissions," as being apparently necessary to repeal the limitations of the Irish act: and so strongly was the supposed import of these words impressed on the minds of some most intelligent members of the other house of parliament, that, for the purpose of giving effect to their opinion of the expediency of confining the measure to the Irish act, they had intended to propose that the additional words "or appointments" should be omitted; which alteration would have rendered the clauses not only conformable to their wishes, but to the terms of the dispatch of the 9th of February, as well as to what he had conceived to be the true construction of it. It therefore appears, that the dispatch itself, as well as the reasoning upon which it was recommended, was not calculated to impart to his majesty's mind a knowledge of the extensive import which it was actually intended to convey: and that it was not only not extraordinary that it should have been understood by his majesty in a limited sense, but that it would be justly a matter of surprise if it could have been viewed in any other light.&#x2014;Lord Sidmouth then proceeded to state what had occurred after he had learnt that the measure was designed to be carried beyond the provisions of the Irish act. His own objections were immediately stated to the noble lord at the head of the government, accom-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0213"/>
<col>395</col>
panied by a declaration, which was frequently repeated on subsequent occasions, of the necessity under which he should feel himself of opposing the extension in parliament. A few days afterwards, upon being informed by the judge-advocate-general, that he had been directed to prepare clauses, to be inserted in the mutiny bill, which would have the effect of repealing the limitations in the Irish act, he went to the Foreign office, the noble baron (lord Grenville) being out of town, and expressed to lord Howick his own sentiments respecting the measure, and his conviction that the extent of it was not understood by the king; and he owed it to that noble lord to declare, that he manifested the utmost anxiety, that means should be taken to prevent or obviate any misapprehension on the part of his majesty, before the measure was submitted to parliament. On the return of the noble baron (Grenville), he made a similar communication to his lordship; and on the 1st of March, this subject was discussed in cabinet.&#x2014;At that meeting, he (lord S.) declared his persuasion, founded on his majesty's language to himself on the 11th of February, and on his majesty's answer to the minute of cabinet on the 12th, that his majesty was not aware of the extent of the proposed measure, and likewise expressed his own sense of the indispensable necessity of putting an end to all doubts on a point of so much delicacy and importance. The noble baron, however, then stated, that he had seen his majesty on the 11th of Feb. subsequently to the audience granted to himself (lord S.), and that he had no reason to doubt his majesty's full comprehension of the measure, as now intended to be submitted to parliament. After much discussion, it was proposed by lord Howick, to transmit to his majesty a copy of the clauses intended to be inserted in the Mutiny bill. Of this suggestion he (lord S.) declared his entire approbation; but added, that it would be necessary for him to accompany the communication of these clauses, with a note from himself, expressive of his dissent from those parts of them, which carried the measure beyond what he had understood to be intended by the dispatch to the lord lieutenant, of the 9th of Feb., and the minute of cabinet, of the subsequent day. In the result however, the suggestion of sending the clauses was not then adopted, and no communication on this point was made from the cabinet to the king. In the evening of
<col>396</col>
the following day, he pressed the re-consideration of the subject on lord Grenville, and was informed by his lordship in answer, that the clauses had been sent on that day to his majesty;&#x2014;they were accompanied, as he had since learnt, by a dispatch to the lord lieutenant, and a note from the secretary of state. On the Tuesday evening (March the 3d) he found, that the clauses were returned by the king without any comment; from which circumstance, his majesty's acquiescence had been inferred; an inference somewhat hastily drawn, as he thought, and upon insufficient grounds.&#x2014;On the following day, he waited on his majesty at the Queen's palace, on his official business; and then stated, at an audience, what it would have been more satisfactory to him to have expressed in a note at an earlier period, and which he should have had an opportunity of doing, if the clauses had been communicated to his majesty, in consequence of a minute of the cabinet. On that day the king having been fully apprised, not only by himself, but by lord Howick, of the nature and details of the measure, communicated to lord Howick his sentiments, in a manner which had unquestionably been misunderstood by that noble lord: but it was also an indisputable fact, that it was intended by his majesty explicitly to declare that his consent was confined to that part of the measure to which he had before reluctantly acceded, viz. the extension of the act of 1793 to Great Britain.&#x2014;On the Friday following, it having been judged proper to relinquish the mode of proceeding by clauses in the Mutiny bill, lord Howick moved the house of commons for leave to bring in a bill, the object of which was to open both army and navy, without restriction or limitation, to the Catholics and Dissenters of the United Kingdom. The bill was accordingly brought in, and ordered to be read a second time on Thursday the 12th of March. Under these circumstances, and having been apprised of the favourable manner in which lord Howick's proposition appeared to have been received in the house of commons, he (lord S.) wrote, on Monday the 9th, to lord Grenville, stating, that "He found it impossible to act up to his own opinions on parts of this bill, in the manner which their influence on his mind necessarily required, and, at the same time, to satisfy his sense of what was due to the government of which he was a member,"
<image src="S1V0009P0I0214"/>
<col>397</col>
On the next day, he had a conversation on the subject with the noble baron, and, on the day following, he informed him, by letter, of his determination to retire from the office of president of the council, "as the only course he could pursue with justice to the noble lord, and with honour to himself." On that day (March the 11th), he made a communication to his majesty to a similar effect, and immediately received his majesty's gracious commands to remain in his office. The noble baron (lord G.) having also expressed to him, by letter, his wish, that his resolution might be suspended, he acquiesced, upon a distinct understanding, that he was to be considered as completely at liberty to take such steps as he might think proper for opposing the bill then before parliament.&#x2014;On that day (March the 11th), his majesty expressed to lord Sidmouth in strong terms, as soon as he entered his closet, his surprise at the extent of the proposition which had been opened in the house of commons; his majesty having, as he conceived, apprised lord Howick, on the preceding Wednesday, of his decided repugnance to that part of it which went beyond the Irish act of 1793. There could be no possible doubt but that on this point lord Howick had misconceived his majesty. Lord H. was incapable of opening a proposition in the house of commons in his official character, contrary to the known opinion of the king, and in the face of his authority. Lord Howick however stood not in need of any farther vindication on this subject; ample justice had been done him by the gracious declaration of his sovereign. It should be stated, that, on that day, lord Grenville was distinctly informed by his majesty, that to that part of the bill which exceeded the limits of the act of 1793 he could not be induced to give his consent.&#x2014;From this statement, lord Sidmouth said, it appeared, that his majesty, having received the clauses on Tuesday the 3d of March, took an opportunity, on the following day, of expressing to lord Howick, in person, his objection to the extent to which the measure was proposed to be carried: that his majesty, unaware that he had not been so understood by his lordship, manifested, on the 11th, (the day on which his majesty was next at the Queen's Palace) his surprise at the proposition which had been submitted to the house of commons; and on that day declared his sentiments to lord Grenville in a manner upon which no misconception appears to have arisen.&#x2014;Under
<col>398</col>
these circumstances, he (lord S.) entertained a hope, which he expressed to the noble lord at the head of the government, that the bill might be so modified as to free it from objections which were evidently insuperable: that hope was however disappointed.&#x2014;On the 15th, a meeting was held of a large majority of his majesty's confidential servants, to which neither the lord chancellor, the chief justice of the king's bench, nor himself, were summoned; and of which they were not apprised. At that meeting, it is understood that a minute was prepared, declaring a willingness to abandon the bill, but accompanying the offer with certain reservations, which were, he thought, deeply to be lamented, and which appear to have been the immediate cause of the events which ensued.&#x2014;The effect on his majesty was such as might have been expected. He probably apprehended that a question from which he had already suffered so much, was never to be at rest: that his mind, made up as it was from a combined sense of religious and politicial obligation, was to remain perpetually exposed to a recurrence of importunity and anxiety. Having expressed his hope, but a short time before, that he might not again be distressed on this subject, he now required that he should hear of it no more; and claimed from his ministers a written declaration to that effect. This he (lord S.) understood to be the case; though at the time when he was speaking, he had neither seen the minute of his late colleagues, nor his majesty's answer. He believed, however, that the statement was correct; and he had no hesitation in declaring, that, under any pledge whatever that was to fetter him in the performance of his public duty, he would never accept office, nor remain in it. But this requisition was to be considered with reference, not only to the abstract principle upon which he trusted there could be no difference of opinion, but to the peculiar nature of the case, and to the circumstances with which it was attended. The question to which it applied was not, in his majesty's estimation, merely political; it was one of honour and of conscience, connected with the deepest sense of public duty, and of religious obligation; deriving its importance from the conditions which established the house of Brunswick on the throne, and which at the time of his coronation had been solemnly ratified by himself.&#x2014;Was it then possible for the house of lords to fix on their journals a recorded censure of a step
<image src="S1V0009P0I0215"/>
<col>399</col>
which could only be ascribed to such feelings, and such principles? For his own part, had he been one of those to whom the answer was addressed, he should have considered it in no other light than as a painful but decisive proof, that he no longer possessed that portion of the royal confidence, which could afford him a prospect of carrying on the government, to the satisfaction of his majesty; and he should accordingly have asked permission to retire from his service. Such would have been his conduct; and here was a material point of difference between his late colleagues and himself. He could not forbear adding, that his majesty, he was confident, had no intention to part with his ministers, previous to the communication of the 15th of March: and he had no other reason for supposing that such was his intention afterwards, excepting as far as he thought it might be inferred from his majesty's answer. Lord Sidmouth then proceeded to state what appeared to him to be the meaning and tendency of the noble marquis's motion. It was founded on the supposition of a wrong done; and that, by the intervention of a secret adviser; a supposition unsupported by evidence, or by any reasonable presumption, and therefore manifestly inconsistent with justice. No one, he said, could feel more strongly than himself the sound wisdom of that great constitutional principle, that the king can do no wrong: that is, that for every act of executive government, there must be a responsible adviser. But he contended, that there were many functions of the sovereign, which, though strictly legitimate, not only might, but must be performed, without any such responsibility being attached to them, and which must therefore be considered as the personal acts of the king. Of these the constitution does not take cognizance; nor can they be fit subjects of public discussion. In the present instance, there were few indeed who did not believe that the answer was the answer of the king himself; that it proceeded from the uninstigated impulse of his own heart. If so, (and there was not only no evidence, but no rational presumption to the contrary,) where did the resolution point? To the throne, to the king himself! Such, he was bound to admit, could not be the intention of the noble marquis, or of those who supported the motion; but such was its obvious and necessary direction, and such must be its effect. From these considerations, he was compelled to resist it.&#x2014;Inconsistent, however,
<col>400</col>
with justice, and with the best principles of the constitution, as this proposition appeared to him to be, it was also objectionable, because the supposition which it implied, even under its most favourable interpretation, was utterly unwarranted by experience. He denied, that there was a pretence for imputing to the august personage, whose name, and whose conduct had been too much brought into discussion, a disposition to listen to secret advisers. That great and distinguished man, who had served his majesty with unrivalled ability, and with signal benefit to his country, during a period of 17 years, had, to his own personal knowledge, rendered ample justice, in this respect, to his royal master; and to his attestation he thought it incumbent upon him to add his own, founded on an experience of that degree of confidence which fixes the most unqualified, but at the same time the most honourable responsibility on a servant of the crown.&#x2014;It had however been said, that to resist such a motion would be to excite and justify apprehension and distrust in the minds of the Catholics; feelings ill suited to the spirit of toleration, and to the benignity, by which his majesty's whole reign had been so eminently distinguished. The great body of the Catholics, he was persuaded, would not forget the liberal and magnanimous policy, of which they had experienced the advantage since his majesty's accession to the throne. It was during the present reign, that the penal code, and various disabilities, to which they had been liable for nearly a century, were done away; and they were therefore fully assured that nothing could be withheld from them in consequence of a want of benevolence on the part of their sovereign. His majesty's gracious disposition, so long tried, and so frequently manifested, was, they well knew, only restrained and limited by a sense of duty to his whole people, and by his view of the obligations which at the time of his coronation, had been solemnly contracted by himself.&#x2014;It was not, however, true in fact, as had been stated by a noble lord who had spoken against the original motion, that "the obstacle to the wishes of the Catholics was to be found in the honourable and conscientious feelings of the king." This position he absolutely denied. A decisive obstacle was to be found in the declared opinion of parliament, and in the prevailing and undoubted sentiments and feelings of the people.&#x2014;What, however, were, in fact, the claims against which the door said is
<image src="S1V0009P0I0216"/>
<col>401</col>
to be shut? Claims, for the success of which no great degree of solicitude had either been expressed, or could be felt, by the great mass of the catholic community in the united kingdom. It had been said, that the policy of the measure, which had lately been so much discussed, was to substitute a system of conciliation for one of persecution. He was, however, at a loss to conceive, at what period of his majesty's reign it would now be said that a spirit of persecution had been manifested by the government, or the legislature, towards his majesty's Roman Catholic subjects. His majesty's accession had, on the contrary, been, as he had before stated, the &#x00E6;ra not only of an enlightened toleration, but of a liberal and enlarged policy towards persons of the Roman Catholic persuasion in every part of the kingdom; and, with respect to Ireland, it could not be seriously contended that of late years, to say the least, such a spirit had appeared to actuate the government of that part of his majesty's dominions. No one would impute it to the administration of the duke of Bedford: that of lord Hardwicke was a subject of general and unqualified panegyric: and he would ever contend, that whatever instances of violence and cruelty might have occurred during the disastrous period of the rebellion, they were in no degree imputable to the system of government either in Ireland, or at home. Without recurring to an earlier period, he would only add, that in the year 1793, the measures adopted towards the Catholics in Ireland had not only been marked by a spirit of toleration and liberality which he admired and applauded, but by a prodigality of concession, which broke down the constitutional barrier between Catholics and Protestants, and made it, as he admitted, very difficult to take a distinction in point of principle, between what had been granted and what was withheld. For himself, who thought that too much had been granted, it was competent to say, that he would not consent to grant more. He was convinced that concession beyond the point at which it had long since arrived, instead of being the cure, was and would be a fresh cause of discontent; that, to preserve the tranquillity of Ireland, it was necessary to act on a firm, steady, and at the same time temperate system: to abstain from raising hopes, which could neither be realized, nor disappointed, without public inconvenience and danger; but, at the same time to let the Catholics feel, that,
<col>402</col>
though, an increased portion of political power was withheld from them from considerations of policy and expediency, they are in other respects precisely on the same footing as all other classes and descriptions of his majesty's subjects, entitled to equal favour and equal protection.&#x2014;This was the system upon which Ireland was governed in the time of lord Hardwicke, (a system congenial to that which, at the same period, was adopted in England); and, as he had the happiness of thinking, with general satisfaction and success. In Ireland, whilst it animated the zeal of the loyal, it had also the effect, in many instances, of calming the turbulent, and of silencing, if not of reclaiming, the disaffected. During lord Hardwicke's administration, there was no agitation in Ireland on the ground of catholic claims, and it was a well known fact, that Emmett, whose desperate project was occasioned by other causes, declared, a short time before his execution, that such was the impression generally produced by the lenity and liberality of the government, that, if he had delayed his attempt only for a few weeks, it would have met with so little support as not to afford any chance whatever of success. It did not, therefore, appear to him, that, for the purpose of tranquillizing the minds of Catholics, it was necessary to agree to this motion. That object could alone be obtained by a wise, and temperate system of government; by firmness without rigour, and by conciliation without concession.&#x2014;He then stated, that the intent of the motion of the noble marquis was evidently to censure the dismission of his majesty's late ministers, and the practical tendency of it to raise the credit of the former government at the expence of the present, so as to effect the removal of the one, and the reinstatement of the other. From the motion abstractedly taken, he could not dissent; but he disapproved of its object, and still more of the mode of pursuing it. He considered the change of government as a public misfortune, particularly in the present state of this country, and of Europe: but he would not on that account concur in attempting to force back the late ministers into the councils of the king. He acknowledged that he could not contemplate the present administration without feelings of anxiety and distrust, though he had a high opinion of some of the members of it; and for the noble earl in particular, at the head of the ordnance, he entertained the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0217"/>
<col>403</col>
most affectionate respect, founded on an intercourse of friendship, which had neither abated nor been interrupted during a period of near 40 years. But, on the present occasion, he was not called upon to weigh the merits of the new government, but to discharge a duty to his sovereign, and to the constitution of his country and the difference between one set of ministers, and another, important as it unquestionably was, and particularly at such a crisis, appeared to him to be of less moment, than the difference between reducing the monarch to a cypher, and supporting him in the full exercise of his constitutional authority. These reflections, however, applied solely to the appointment of ministers, and not to the measures of government.&#x2014;Lord Sidmouth concluded with saying, that he thought it incumbent upon him to state some particulars which appeared to him to be material, in order to place in its true light a transaction, which, he repeated, ought never to have been the subject of public discussion; though the conduct of the great personage, who had been so much alluded to, must, he was confident, appear to have been such as to give him a fresh claim, if possible, to the veneration, affection, and gratitude of his people. In his vote on the question before the house, his lordship said he should be actuated by a determination to discountenance any proposition which might be considered as tending even by the most remote construction and inference to throw an imputation on the conduct of the king, or to fetter and controul his majesty in the exercise of his lawful prerogative; and onthese grounds he should support the motion for the adjournment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale rose</member> <membercontribution>and said:&#x2014;My lords, in the course of my public life, I never heard a proposition more calmly, and decisively argued, than the proposition which has this night been submitted by my noble friend, to the consideration of this house. And never, my lords, was a mode of answer substituted, I will not only say, more unfair, but more calculated to excite unfounded prejudices, to propagate throughout the country a doctrine which must inevitably tend to produce improper feelings, and to mislead the general decision. Some noble lords have talked a great deal of conscientious scruples, and under the pretext of those scruples, they would call upon your lordships to judge of a constitutional question. Next, the noble viscount (Sidmouth) apprehends, and there-
<col>404</col>
fore concludes, that the resolution of my noble friend is directed against the character of my sovereign; but I do contend, that a question, involving the conduct of the executive government, was never, in the history of this country, submitted to the decision of the legislature, in which the principle of responsibility was more clearly and accurately ascertained. The noble viscount has argued, that in order to make valid the charge against secret advisers, it must be proved, that the advice was given previous to the adoption of the measure. To this doctrine I cannot subscribe, because I am convinced that constitutional responsibility embraces not only advice given previous to the measure taken, but goes as well to a passive acquiescence in deliberating, as to an active assistance in carrying them into effect. Suppose, for instance, that a dispatch was sent to the lord lieutenant of Ireland, and that the noble secretary for the home department was ignorant of its contents; if he afterwards contributed in the slightest degree to give efficacy and extent to that dispatch, then I do affirm that he would be, in the spirit of the constitution, fully responsible to this house and to the country, for the consequences of that measure, whatever they might be. But, let us view the circumstances of this transaction. Let us, my lords, consider the various links by which the appointment of the new ministry is connected with the causes which led to the change in his majesty's councils. The noble lords on the opposite side, pretend not to be ignorant of the events, and of those circumstances which immediately led to the result. With such information, they assisted in executing the threat which was held out to obtain the written assurance from the late ministry; and, therefore, in my opinion, the responsibility upon them is much stronger. I will go further, and contend, that the very acceptance of their offices, after the knowledge they admit to have, of such a pledge being demanded, is, in the sound doctrine of the constitution, a sufficient ground for holding his majesty's present ministers responsible, both for the changes which have taken place, and the pledge which has been required. Were his majesty's present ministers even to say, It is true, we know that such a requisition was made, but we were not parties to it, and even for ourselves have refused; still the constitution considers them responsible. In the good times of this country, when the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0218"/>
<col>405</col>
strong feeling of constitutional jealousy actuated every man in the state, there was no argument, no excuse, no palliation, for any inroad on the just and acknowledged privileges of the people. When my lord Somers himself, that able statesman, to whose talents and patriotism the country was so peculiarly indebted, when even he, I say, pleaded to parliament, upon the discussion of the Partition Treaty, that he was no party to the measure, it refused to listen to the justification. It spoke in the sound, stern, and salutary language of the constitution, that he who assists, that he who lends his name and sanction and character to carry it into execution, is the responsible person. At whatever period it might be ascertained that he engaged in it, or whether there were others who had previously introduced it, was not a matter of much consequence. The country has a concurrent judgment against them all, might bring them to the bar of this or the other house of parliament, and arraign them for the mischiefs which were the result. What was lord Danby's case? In his own defence he produced a letter, that was written by the king's order. But it did not avail him: wherever it originated, he was responsible for the execution. The present ministers might say, We have not agreed to any such pledge. The answer was, that in receiving their offices, they were bound by the spirit of that requisition, that they had virtually given it. Having shewn the late administration as a warning, the executive could say, You know the conditions upon which you are called to my councils; you are aware of the kind of men suited to my opinions. In fact, the very nature of the transaction, proves to the most common understanding, that his majesty himself felt he was acting under advice, and of course with his advisers, subjected to constitutional responsibility. The noble lord himself, who sits on the woolsack, must feel that his majesty was of that opinion, and therefore we may account for the expeditious determination, in two hours, of that noble lord&#x2014;a shorter interval of time than he was usually expected to make up his mind in. But, to advert to the administration so lately formed, I am at a loss to judge in what manner the contradictory opinions of the component parts can be reconciled? How can we reconcile the opinion of the secretary of state for foreign affairs (Mr. Canning), as formerly expressed, with his present connection with the noble secretary
<col>406</col>
for the home department? or in what manner reconcile the immutable opinion of the latter noble secretary, with the repeated pledges of his colleague at the head of the colonial department (lord Castlereagh) to the Catholics of Ireland? Were these contradictions to be got rid of, in what way can we conceive the repeated and long continued attachment and promises of the noble duke (of Portland) at the head of his majesty's councils! Consider the present ministry, my lords, in their individual characters, or in their collective capacity, and you must conclude in one of these two opinions, either that there is no principle or cement of union amongst them, or that they have agreed to give up every doctrine and opinion to which they were most sacredly pledged.&#x2014;The noble earl here took a retrospective view of the parliamentary opinions of some of the leading members of the present cabinet, and on the views they entertained of the necessity of catholic emancipation. If that question was not now discussed, or brought forward before parliament, it was not owing to the exertions or delicacy of the present ministers, but to the genuine loyalty and unfeigned affection of his majesty's late ministers. He must repeat, that he had no hopes of any great national objects being accomplished by the present administration, for they had not the advantage to be well connected with any considerable body of persons in either house of parliament. They had nothing on which to depend, except the personal favour of their sovereign and the sheer influence of the crown, having rendered themselves obnoxious to all those who loved independence, by the servility with which they had accepted their situations, having recognised the pledge which their predecessors scorned; besides which, the discordant materials of which they were made up, left no room to hope any good from their exertions, differing so essentially as they had done on the most essential points; and upon none more than on the very point which had occasioned their coming into power. But it was said that the motion now before the house was a mere abstract proposition, and as such, unnecessary to be voted; now, he admitted it to be an abstract proposition, but he denied that on that account it was unnecessary to be voted; on the contrary, he thought it became absolutely necessary to vote it, on account of what had happened previous to the dismissal of the late ministers, and on account of the terms on which the present
<image src="S1V0009P0I0219"/>
<col>407</col>
ministers came into office; for the maxim, that the king can do no wrong, had been brought into great danger by the conduct of the present ministers, if it had not been overthrown by it. What was meant by the maxim, that the king could do no wrong? Did that maxim mean so absurd a proposition as that the king was formed by the hand of God without defect, and different from every other mortal? Certainly nothing so stupid as that idea could enter a sound understanding; but it meant, that as all government was originally founded for the good of the people, and as ours had been fortunately so kept up a long while, the people had a right to say, when any mischief was done in government, there was a fault somewhere; and it was convenient to fix it on some other person or persons than the king; and as the king followed advice in his acts, it was said that the king can do no wrong; but, whenever any thing was amiss in his government, it was considered, not as the act of the king but the act of his advisers. That adviser was responsible to the people; and it was upon this principle that the maxim that the king can do no wrong, was founded. Hence the present resolution became necessary to support that maxim, because the present ministers had come into office in direct violation of the fundamental principles of the constitution; and unless the house marked that act with its disapprobation, part of that constitution would be lost. For these reasons, the present resolution had his most hearty concurrence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Mulgrave</member> <membercontribution>observed, that notwithstanding the violent epithets used by the noble lord who had preceded him, he should discuss this question coolly on its own grounds. He contended that a resolution like the present was not to be found in any part of our Parliamentary History. He reminded their lordships of what took place in 1783, when an administration was removed; we saw then what we see now, an administration discharged, greatly dissatisfied on account of its removal. Opposition carried with it great talents, but with as little discretion as marked its conduct on the subject which was the cause of its removal: but not then as now, did such a resolution appear; nor was the king's name used so freely then as on the present occasion; and here he could not help reminding their lordships of the established rule, by which it was held disorderly to mention the king's name in a house of parliament to influence a debate.
<col>408</col>
He thought that the late ministers had been putted up by silly and idle flattery, as if they possessed All the Talents of this country, and it made them think they could dictate to the crown; but this was not to be done by them, nor by any set of men in this kingdom. It was said, that the course they were now pursuing had been rendered necessary by the conduct of their sovereign; but that was not so, they were not put upon their defence, although they were pleased to say so. Their sovereign made no charge against them; but under the idea of making their defence, when they were not charged with any thing, they thought themselves at liberty to say something by which they ought to impute something to the conduct of somebody whom nobody knows, whom they call the adviser of the king, in a case in which it is manifest his majesty could not have had any adviser; and, as far as his own individual feelings went, he must say that he felt considerable doubt of the propriety of making the disclosures which had been made in this case. The oath of a privy counsellor had been much insisted on; but that did not call on them for their own justification in a case wherein there was no charge made against them, to bring forward resolutions in parliament indirectly tending to reflect on the conduct of his majesty. The substance of the measure before the house was, whether his majesty did not from the first signify his discontent to the measure which was proposed by the late ministers in favour of the Catholics. There was no question but that his majesty gave his reluctant and tardy consent to the clauses in the mutiny bill; that he meant to confine the whole matter strictly to the Irish act of 1793; and that his majesty then said he would not go one step further: and the papers now before the house established beyond dispute that fact. Now, considering how the business was conducted upon this, the measure attempted to be carried was grounded on the idea of preserving peace in Ireland; grounds on which his majesty's late ministers could not themselves agree, and yet they went on with the measure after they knew that his majesty could not assent to it according to his own conscientious sense of the oath which he took at his coronation&#x2014;an oath which his majesty was awfully impressed with the conviction of its being registered in heaven. These ministers considered whether they could mend the act of parliament which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0220"/>
<col>409</col>
they had brought into the house of commons; but finding that impossible consistently with the objects they had in view, they relinquished the matter altogether; although at the time they brought it in, they had solemnly declared it was absolutely necessary for the safety of that part of the British empire. And yet, after this, they claimed the right of proposing this or the like measure from time to time to his majesty; although they knew that the sense he entertained of his coronation oath prevented him from assenting to it, they claimed the right to do so&#x2014;said they were bound to do so from the view they had of their oaths as privy counsellors; and yet they had not the same tenderness for the regard which the king had for his own coronation oath, registered, as he felt it to be, in heaven. They were not blamed for what they did; they were not bound to relinquish their oaths, for they could retire from office; and why should they ask his majesty to relinquish the sense which he entertained of his oath? He really should have been sorry that any of those with whom he had the honour to act, should have brought forward this subject before parliament in any shape; but the other side insisted on it, and the dilemma in which they had placed themselves was such, that he could not conceive how men of such understandings as the late ministers, could place themselves in it. As to the question of a pledge, he had to observe, that no pledge was asked of the late ministers, until they had set the example by laying in a claim to be at liberty to advise his majesty upon a subject on which they knew his mind was entirely made up; and that was the foundation of the pledge required by the king; nor did he see the idea of a pledge in the same light as that in which it struck some noble lords in that house. For instance, if William III. or George I. had said to any of the ministers employed by them&#x2014;I have no objection to any of your principles in general, except that I think you are attached to the house of Stuart; and therefore, unless you give me an undertaking or pledge in writing, I will not employ you as my ministers. He apprehended there would not have been any impropriety in such ministers signing such a pledge; and he wished to know why his majesty should be less entitled to be satisfied against the re-introduction of popery into this land? How did the case stand at this time? The late administration
<col>410</col>
gave way to the conscientious scruples of the king upon the present occasion; but they attempted to retain the right to bring forward the same subject again when occasion should require; which was as much as to say, When rebellion may rage within your dominions, and when you may be less able to resist the application, and may not on the sudden be able to form a ministry, then we will advise you to do what you have declared in your conscience you never can do. What sort of policy did these ministers call this? For these reasons the noble lord did not see the unreasonableness of the pledge demanded by his majesty from his late ministers. As to the secret advisers who had been talked of, all he had to say was, that no such existed: if the late ministers knew of such a person existing, let them bring forward proof of it. With regard to the difference of opinion which had subsisted between the present ministry on former occasions, he could only say there was nothing among them that was irreconcileable. But who were they who charged the present administration with disagreement upon public matters of opinion? Why, truly, those who never agreed on any thing until they united to form an administration. Some of them had differed from each other on the treaty of Amiens. many more of them on the subject of the French revolution, and that most substantially and radically, and had treated each other with remarkable acrimony and asperity; and therefore he owned his astonishment when he heard, from such a quarter, objections to an administration on account of its being composed of men who had formerly differed from each other upon matters of public policy. As to the principles of the present administration, the best thing he could say of them was, that they were founded upon pre-uniform and common feeling of regard and veneration for that great and illustrious man (Mr. Pitt), whose loss was so much and so justly deplored, and whose principles of policy were models which the present administration had the ambition to imitate. What was the conduct of that illustrious statesman on this very question? did he come forward in parliament to do what was now attempted to be done by the late administration? No; he abstained from it altogether. The noble lord then said, that he never had so much confidence in any other person as he had in that right hon. gentleman. All the praise the present administration could ever hope to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0221"/>
<col>411</col>
meet was from acting on his principles, and imitating him as much as possible; for which reason, when out of power, they had never entered into any captious opposition. His lordship concluded with saying, that he hoped the present motion would not only meet the negative, but the reprobation of their lordships, pointed as it was against the sacred character of majesty itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Limerick</member> <membercontribution>lamented that Ireland was always made the scene of faction and discord, by holding out and encouraging expectations that could not be gratified while the resolution of his majesty on the Catholic question was so decidedly fixed. He expressed considerable disapprobation of the conduct of the duke of Bedford, in permitting the disturbances in the west of Ireland to spread from one district to another, till at last seven different counties were involved in disorder and tumult, and this before any means were adopted for the purpose of suppressing them. At length the judges had been sent on a circuit through that part of the country; but had they brought back the misguided men to a state of order and quiet? If his information was correct, the case was very different. He said that many of the Irish Catholics were at present disaffected, and he would wish to give them a speedy and a positive denial, as to the indulgences which they claimed, that they should no further have hopes, that they should not hereafter have any ground for complaining of hopes deferred. There had lately been upon a northern circuit some persons convicted of riotous conduct, and shortly after, eight of the witnesses were murdered. Afterwards, there were great enormities committed in Sligo, as if they meant to dare the government. What! would you give up to faction and clamour what you refuse to loyal representation? There were two cases which he could instance, where two of the most loyal gentlemen in Ireland were prosecuted; they were certainly honourably acquitted, but the judges themselves observed that they had never seen such a scandalous conspiracy against any man, as that against them was; their loyalty was supposed to be their only crime. It was a strange remedy to think of removing the discontents of the lower classes of the Catholics, by promoting the higher ranks to the top of the army. From the known fact that two regiments lately raised by gentlemen of high Catholic connection, were raised by ordinary recruiting, he
<col>412</col>
concluded that very little facility of recruiting the army would be gained by passing the Catholic Officers' bill. The proceedings that had been taken by the authors of that bill were calculated to make the Catholics think the English the enemies of themselves and their religion. He reprobated the versatility of system pursued with respect to Ireland; a system at one time maintaining high Protestant ascendancy, and at another time conceding all to the Catholics. Either concede every thing, or come to a firm resolution to concede no more. He reprobated the practice of governing Ireland by a faction; and recommended not to discourage loyalty, nor to practise on the people for party purposes. It would be unbecoming the dignity of parliament to grant any indulgence to men who were in the temper that the Catholics of Ireland at present were in.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>expressed great surprise at the language which the noble earl who had just sat down had held respecting the government of Ireland and the conduct of the duke of Bedford, a lieutenant who had endeared himself to every class of his majesty's subjects in that part of the empire, and whose departure was the subject of universal regret, as his administration had been the subject of universal approbation. Though he had not the local information of the noble lord, and was connected with no factions and no factious families in Ireland, he would venture to assert that the duke of Bedford's vice-royalty was looked upon in a very different light from that in which the noble lord had placed it. And, after all, what was the amount of the charge against the duke of Bedford, and the anecdote which had been alluded to, but that the lord lieutenant had refused to listen to those, who pressed for violent and extraordinary measures to put down some disturbances which unhappily had prevailed, and persisted in employing the vigour of the law alone in maintaining and restoring the public tranquillity? Indeed, respecting the state of Ireland, different noble lords had given different views. One said that Ireland was quiet, and to bring forward any question about the Catholics was unnecessary. The noble lord who spoke last, however, said that disturbances prevailed; and seemed to censure the duke of Bedford's administration on that account. If any thing, however, more than another, recommended the conduct of the duke of Bedford to the people of Ireland and to the lovers of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0222"/>
<col>413</col>
the constitution, it was that he claimed no extraordinary powers, and had put in execution no measures of severity. These topics, and several others, seemed to have been introduced with little application to the immediate question before the house, which consisted of two parts. The motion expressed two things, regret at the change which had taken place at this time in his majesty's government, and asserted that it would be unconstitutional for any minister to give any pledge not to give his majesty advice on any particular subject. It was said, that this was dragging the king before parliament, and sitting in judgment upon him. This doctrine had been most ably answered by several of his noble friends who had already spoken, and particularly by his noble and learned friend (lord Erskine) who had delivered a speech of so much ability and constitutional information, that to those most familiar with his eloquence, it seemed to excel any of his former exhibitions. If, however, he understood any thing of the constitution of this country, its freedom, its tranquillity, nay its safety, were involved in the maxim, that the king could do no wrong; which the doctrines on the other side tended completely to overthrow. He was much surprised to find that his noble friend (lord Sidmouth) had given countenance to such doctrines, and had maintained that there were circumstances in which the king was his own adviser, and instanced the remarks on measures submitted by the cabinet. But surely this was no proof that the king could act without a responsible adviser, but the contrary. If ministers, after receiving such remarks and suggestions, thought proper to adopt and act upon them, most undoubtedly they became responsible. In no instance whatever did the constitution presume the king to be without a responsible adviser. A stronger instance than the case of lord Danby could not be conceived. That was a case when lord Danby had been engaged in something relative to a negociation; but it might have been a matter in which the king's conscience might have been concerned. Yet, though the king, in the most authentic manner, and not in any garbled extract of a cabinet minute published in a newspaper, expressed his opinion and satisfaction of lord Danby's conduct; though the king took the seals and gave them to the purse-bearer to affix to the pardon, yet the house of commons voted, that lord
<col>414</col>
Danby's defence, pleading the king's commands, was an aggravation of his offence, as it tended to hold up the king to public odium. Who, then, are the persons responsible for every act of the king? Those surely who publicly appear and give effect to the views of the king. It was not necessary therefore to seek for secret advisers. Those who gave effect to the resolutions of the king, were responsible; and if a contrary principle were once to be sanctioned, and to be supposed the law of the land, the constitution was at an end, the functions of parliament were a jest. Nothing more would be necessary than to make any public measure a question of conscience, and from that moment acts might be done for which there was no responsibility. Parliament had, in every case, in the exercise of the king's legislative authority, as well as every other, always presumed that he acted by advice, and they had addressed him, to know who were his advisers. In the present case the pledge of itself, though highly unconstitutional was little in comparison with the principle that the king can do no wrong; which must be totally subverted if it was established that acts could be done, from which the most important consequences proceeded, and yet there were no responsible advisers.&#x2014; The noble lord here proceeded to illustrate these positions, and alluded to the letters under the signature of Sc&#x00E6;vola, which had appeared in the Morning Chronicle on the subject. Sir William Temple had told the king that he doubted whether it were not a contradiction to suppose that he could make counsellors that were not to counsel. What sir W. Temple thought a contradiction, the appointment of the present ministers seemed to render matter of fact. An allusion had been made to a supposed pledge given by Mr. Pitt on the Catholic question previous to his coming into office in 1804; but if such a report was well founded, it was clear that some person had been the bearer of the pledge of Mr. Pitt, who then was out; and if so, it was obvious that secret influence and agency had been employed in removing the noble viscount (Sidmouth) from power in 1804. Next, with respect to the misunderstanding which had prevailed on the subject of the bill brought into parliament, he would say little. It was not doubted that such a misunderstanding existed, and this circumstance alone could have led him to concur in its being withdrawn. But when the bill was withdrawn, and that sort
<image src="S1V0009P0I0223"/>
<col>415</col>
of amende honorable made with respect to it, he could not see with what propriety a discussion of that measure was necessary to decide the present question. With respect to the bill itself, it was well known that its principle, indeed in a much larger extent, had received the approbation of almost all the leading men in this country. Mr. Pitt had expressed himself in the strongest terms as to the policy, nay the necessity of catholic concession. Another person of the most extraordinary talents, Mr. Burke, had, to his last moment, earnestly recommended the repeal of all the disabilities in the Catholic body. Was it not shameful, then, that an outcry should be raised against the late ministers as enemies to the church, for proposing part of what Mr. Pitt and so many others had so much approved of? Nay, several of those in the new ministry, and connected with it, had entertained similar sentiments, and he left it to the noble viscount. (Melville) to argue the policy of the measure with those of the new ministry, who attempted to raise clamours and disturbance on pretence of danger from popery on account of this measure. The noble lord then touched on some observations made on the minute of the cabinet, in which they reserved the right to submit to his majesty whatever advice respecting the Catholics circumstances might require. He was surprized to hear the noble viscount (Sidmouth) say that it would be unconstitutional for any member of the crown to vote in parliament in favour of any measure that had not the king's approbation. But, surely, nothing was more unfounded. It would not be pretended that Mr. Pitt had the king's permission to vote on the slave trade, or to propose parliamentary reform. As to the reservation contained in the cabinet minute presented to the king, at most it was superfluous, because it seemed only what was their duty to do, but in fact, if they had not made the reservation, it would have been said that they had deceived the king, in agitating matters he had thought to he abandoned. He now came to say a few words of the new ministers, and however amiable some of them might be in private life, or however qualified to shine in either house of parliament, it could not be forgotten, that a twelvemonth ago they had considered themselves incapable. But, when to this was added, that they came in upon unconstitutional grounds, the reason to regret the change was greatly strengthened. It had been asked, however, Would you take from the king
<col>416</col>
the prerogative of choosing his own ministers, and give it to the parliament? No, surely; but parliament might give its advice on this as well as every other subject, and a more important occasion for doing so never occurred. Allusion had been made to the case of 1784, and an appeal made to his noble friend, late at the head of his majesty's councils, on that subject. But, if he were disposed to retaliate on this point, he might appeal to the duke of Portland, and claim his aid against lord Grenville. He was not disposed, however, to do so; he was content with the situation in which those noble lords stood in this matter. But there really was no inconsistency whatever in his noble friend on this occasion. In 1784, he might think that there was no occasion to advise his majesty; but at present having no confidence in ministers, he might consider it proper and seasonable for parliament to advise his majesty. But surely in every respect things were now different from what they were in 1784, when parliament was dissolved. Yet now it was unconstitutionally threatened that parliament should be dissolved if it would not support ministers. In 1784, we were at peace; now we were engaged in a most difficult and dangerous war. Then, Mr. Pitt had recently come forward in public life, supported by the immense reputation of his father, and himself affording the highest promise to many. Now, the duke of Portland was at the head of administration, and in all respects different. It would be cruel to push the comparison. But could the present administration, composed of such materials, expect to make any impression on the country by affecting the love, and following the example of Mr. Pitt? It was a degradation of parliament; it was a degradation of the country to suppose it. Often it had been remarked that breaches in free governments were made by men of splendid talents, and that they had paved the way for followers of the lowest character. C&#x00E6;esar made way for Catiline and the duke of Portland imitated Mr. Pitt in establishing himself in power against the constitution. But if any thing could more thoroughly paint the ill effects of the success of Mr. Pitt in 1784, it would be the attempts now made to imitate him, and no small evil of that success would be, the country being brought to endure the present proceedings. But it was madness in the new ministers, the dregs, the lees, the rincings of all former administrations, to think that they could excite that fervour,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0224"/>
<col>417</col>
or kindle that enthusiasm, which supported Mr. Pitt. If they attempted to procure addresses filled with the bigotry which some of them seemed to indulge, and that religious animosity they were so eager to excite, they would only be throwing a slur on Mr. Pitt, and stigmatising those opinions which he entertained. As to the late administration, he would say no more than was necessary to defend them against the reflections cast on them. He took a view of their economical regulations, their plans for auditing the public accounts, their military system, and various other points, and concluded with observing, that it was one of the evils of the new administration that they united no great portion of the people, or considerable interests in their favour, while they came into power with a pledge against four millions of their fellow subjects.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member> <membercontribution>contended that the pledge had only been demanded in consequence of the previous pledges that had been required of his majesty by the ministers. The late ministers had given a great many promises, but had done very little. They had done nothing of any consequence, either with respect to our army, our navy, our finances, or any thing else. He maintained that the system acted upon by himself and his colleagues, on all occasions, with respect to Ireland, had been one of conciliation and mercy. The late ministry, though they united "All the Talents" of the country, had realized none of their magnificent promises. The present ministers however, humble and foolish as they were, would support the king and his prerogative.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Darnley</member> <membercontribution>maintained that, if the late ministers had given the pledge demanded, they would have abandoned their duty, their honour, and the cause of the constitution and the country. There could be no doubt, that it was contrary to the constitution to give a pledge of this nature. It was impossible, in considering this question of pledges, not to advert to the claims of the Catholics, which had given rise to the difference between his majesty and his late ministers. He was of opinion, that the restrictions ought to be done away; but at the same time, he was convinced, that this could not be done with advantage, without the consent of the parliament and of the king. He therefore thought it imprudent at present to agitate the question at all, as it only served to keep expectation alive, which was sure to meet with disappointment. He thought there-
<col>418</col>
fore, that the late ministers might have fairly told the Catholics, that they were friendly to their claims; but, that there at present existed an obstacle, which it was impossible to remove, and that therefore it would be their interest to remain quiet for the present. He was sure the sensible part of the Catholics would feel the force of this reasoning, whatever might be the conduct of a few agitators in Dublin, whose speeches had been published. He concluded by declaring, that he felt himself bound by every sense of duty and of respect for the constitution, to support the original motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>observed, that, late as the hour was, he must state, as shortly as he could, the grounds on which he would support the present motion, which must, in his opinion, be voted for by every man, unless he was contented to go away with the impression that the constitution was completely overturned. He did not say that their lordships must feel themselves bound to vote for the first part of the motion, though he was grateful to his noble friend who proposed it; but he must say, without affectation, that he regretted the dismissal of the late ministry, because they had a system in train, which was working for the best interests of the country. He said nothing of himself, but only looked at the talents of his colleagues, whose unwearied exertions and enlightened views, afforded the best hopes to the country: but if he regretted the loss which the country would sustain from their dismissal, he felt that regret doubled when he considered by whom they were succeeded. He did not mean any disrespect to them individually, but looked at their system, the grounds of their conduct, and the unconstitutional doctrines which they held. With regard to the origin of the difference between his majesty and his late ministers, he would not enter upon it, as he had stated it before, with the permission of his sovereign, and he felt it the less necessary, because that statement had not been shaken by any thing now said, though some attempts had been made, as on a former occasion, to garble and misrepresent it, by taking detached parts of it. A doubt had been expressed whether the draft of a dispatch should be laid before his majesty. He had had some experience in this way, had seen the practice of others, and consulted many documents; and therefore he could state with confidence, that it was both a common method and the best method that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0225"/>
<col>419</col>
could be employed, because the king would be enabled to judge better by seeing the measure itself than by any explanation. In the particular dispatch adverted to, of which he had prepared the draft, it was distinctly stated, that the act of 1793 did not extend to generals on the staff, and it was then stated, that it was desirable to enable all his majesty's subjects to hold any military commissions whatever; and he was astonished at his noble friend when he founded an argument upon this, that the technical terms of an act of parliament were not used in such a dispatch. When he mentioned "any military commission whatever," he undoubtedly meant that these words should cover all military commissions, and nobody could read it with attention without being convinced of this. The word "appointment" was merely added in the bill in order that the shadow of a doubt might not be left; but he should be very well satisfied if the bill were allowed to pass without that word, because he had not the slightest doubt that the words of the dispatch went to the full extent to which the matter could be carried by the addition. But still he was convinced that there must have been a misconception. This misconception, however, he and his colleagues had left nothing in their power undone to remove. With a view to this, they presented to his majesty a remonstrance as dutiful and respectful as subjects could offer to their sovereign; the purport of which remonstrance was to shew, that the act in their contemplation was merely calculated to carry into effect the act of the Irish parliament in 1793, with the spirit of which it would have been manifestly inconsistent to grant those arrangements which were afterwards objected to. The noble lord, after dwelling more at large upon the arguments of the remonstrance referred to, as to considerations of general justice and of general and particular policy, proceeded to remark upon the words, that his majesty "would not go one step further than the act," which this observation alluded to. This act, he contended, was nothing more nor less than that of which his majesty had been frequently informed by the conversations held with him, and the dispatches submitted to his revision, before they were sent to the government of Ireland. With regard to those dispatches, he was really astonished to hear his noble friend on the crossbench (lord Sidmouth) state, that he
<col>420</col>
had doubts as to the meaning of the first, which was sent to the duke of Bedford; for that noble lord had full opportunity of considering it. Upon a fair view of all the circumstances connected with this transaction, he was satisfied that no candid man would see any thing to justify, or even excuse the reproaches so liberally heaped upon himself and his colleagues. With the question now under discussion, however, that transaction had no connection whatever. For when the period did arrive that the misunderstanding as to the bill referred to was found to exist, and the bill in consequence was abandoned, the proposition was made which called for this motion. As to the dilemma put respecting this abandonment, he begged to make one short observation. A noble lord on the other side (lord Mulgrave) had asked, why the bill abandoned should have been at all proposed if not necessary, and if so necessary, why it should have been abandoned? but he would beg that noble lord to put this dilemma to some of the persons connected with him, to those who seceded in 1801, but particularly to put it, for instance, to lord Castlereagh, who had so particularly pledged himself to the Catholic question; who had, in fact, brought that question from Ireland with him. With regard to the coronation oath, he would ask, whether there could be any man in that house who had front enough to maintain, that after the Irish act had been sanctioned, which allowed the Catholics to hold certain commissions, it would be a violation of that oath to allow them to hold the rank of generals? The idea was quite untenable, as indeed, in his judgment, was every other proposition which would impress an opinion that to concede to the claims of the Catholics would at all interfere with that general system which the coronation oath bound the king to maintain. The noble lord reprobated in strong terms the artifices resorted to by ministers and their adherents, to excite a fanatical spirit in the country. He shewed, that so far from the present ministers being uniformly approved of by Mr. Pitt, as a noble lord (Mulgrave) had stated, that illustrious person had on many occasions marked very particularly his disapprobation of the greater part of them, and quoted the instances in which he condemned the conduct of some of them, particularly lord Hawkesbury, when presiding at the foreign department. The noble lord observed upon the explanation, which he had laid
<image src="S1V0009P0I0226"/>
<col>421</col>
before the house with respect to the Catholic bill, and the pledge required of himself and his colleagues, and concluded with stating, that from the manner in which the present administration was formed, and the persons of which it was composed, he could not think of giving it his support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>contended that the whole of the statement made by the noble baron, and of the debates to which that statement gave rise, were proceedings altogether irregular and unparliamentary. The noble baron had accused him and his colleagues of being the first set of ministers who had shrunk from responsibility, and meanly endeavoured to shelter themselves under the wings of their sovereign. He would tell that noble baron, that he and his colleagues were the first ministers who, in order to cloak their own misconduct and absurdities, had so strangely ventured to arraign the personal conduct of his majesty at their lordships' bar. He (lord Hawkesbury) had acted from a sense of duty in accepting a place in the present administration; and as long as he was conscious of acting upon such grounds, he should never shrink from the responsibility, to whatever extent it might be carried, to which his official situation made him liable. He had always been adverse to granting any further concessions to the Catholics, and even to cherishing any such hope in their minds. It was that hope which kept Ireland in a state of continual ferment and agitation, and until it was laid at rest, there would be no permanent tranquillity in that country. The Catholics of Ireland were, he was certain, perfectly grateful for the many indulgences which the whole reign of his majesty was distinguished for granting to them: and equally confident did he feel, that they would demonstrate that gratitude by their steady loyalty, and falsify the contrary prophecies, in which the noble baron seemed so much inclined to indulge.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Camden rose</member> <membercontribution>to reply to some allusions that had been made to his conduct, while at the head of the Irish government. The noble earl denied that he was tied by any pledge, on entering into the present administration, and concluded with giving his support to the motion for adjournment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Moira rose</member> <member>to explain certain points which his noble friend (lord Grenville) had omitted, and contended that it was not in the nature of man, that the Catholics should desist from prosecuting their claims, the concession of which they conceived them-
<col>422</col>
selves to be entitled to by the steadiness of their loyalty, and the zeal and alacrity with which they were anxious to join in resenting the common enemy.</member></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor (Eldon)</member> <membercontribution>agreed with his noble friend (lord Hawkesbury) in representing the present and a former discussion as wholly new, irregular, and unparliamentary. Indeed, he thought the sense of their lordships should be strongly marked to that effect on their Journals. As to the insinuations that had been personally thrown out against himself, as having been one of those who secretly advised his majesty to dismiss his late ministers, he should treat them only with the contempt they deserved. The circumstance of his having had the audience of his majesty, he had stated to the noble baron (lord Grenville), and he trusted that that noble lord was perfectly well satisfied with the sincerity of his statement. The only pledge he had given was the uniform tenour of his public life. His majesty asked no other, and he should continue to serve his sovereign to the best of his abilities, without fearing any responsibility that might attach to his official conduct.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Norfolk</member> <membercontribution>spoke in favour of the original question. After which, the question being universally called for, the house divided on the motion of lord Boringdon, that the house do now adjourn.

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-04-13">Monday, April 13.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>New writs were ordered to be issued for the election of members for the following places: for Marlborough, in the room of the earl of Dalkeith, now lord Tynedale, called to the house of peers; for Bedwin, in the room of viscount Stopford, who had accepted the office of comptroller of his majesty's household; for Mitchell, in the room of sir Arthur Wellesley, who had accepted the office of chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland; for Eye, in the room of lord Huntley, now baron Gordon, called up to the house of peers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[POOR-LAWS BILL.] Mr. Whitbread</member>, <membercontribution>in consequence of the business which was fixed for to-morrow, wished to postpone the re-committal of the bill which he had brought in on that subject, till Friday. He took that opportunity of stating, that in consequence of numerous communications which he had received, he had thought that it would be the best way to divide his original bill into three separate bills. The first of those bills would be with respect to the Poors' Fund; the second would be, for a better equalization of the county rates; and the third would contain all the remaining objects of his bill. In consequence, however, of suggestions and communications which he had received, he intended to leave out of his bill the clauses respecting the adjudication of settlements, and that for rating personal property.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Shaw Lefevre</member> <membercontribution>said, that the subject was one which, perhaps, more than any other, called for a most deliberate consideration and calm discussion. After the threat that had been thrown out a few evenings ago, that parliament should be dissolved if they did not agree to this or that measure of the present administration, it was almost impossible to expect, that, in the course of the present session, or perhaps of the parliament, if that threat should be acted upon, there should be time
<col>424</col>
for that serious and calm consideration which was necessary for a subject of such magnitude, importance, and difficulty. The case, as it now stood, was this: the statute of Elizabeth had been found not sufficient to produce the effects which it proposed. It therefore became necessary that some farther legislative provision should be made. He gave his hon. friend great credit for the attention he had bestowed to this subject, and hoped, that a great part of his bill would be productive of the best consequences; but he was sorry that the clause respecting the relaxation of the settlement laws was to be left out, as that appeared to him to be one of the best parts of the bill. For the reasons he had before mentioned, he should wish the consideration of the measure should be postponed to a much later period, perhaps to the next session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, it must be, indeed, a pusillanimous parliament that would suffer itself to be deterred from the prosecution of its public duties by such a threat, which was certainly as indecent, indiscreet, and unparliamentary, as could possibly have been thrown out. That threat, however, should have no influence upon his mind. He could not see any good consequences likely to result from protracting to a later period the discussion; nor did it appear to him, that that was the most likely mode to gain for the subject the fullest degree of attention and consideration. When a discussion was put off longer than was necessary, the attention of mankind was apt to relax; whereas, if it was brought on while the subject was warm in their minds, it was likely to command more attention, and to be as well considered. He had left out many parts of the bill, in consequence of communications received from a variety of quarters, and he was happy to acknowledge publicly, the great obligations he felt to those gentlemen who had thus assisted him with their observations. He had not given up that part which related to the relaxation of the law of settlements, but that part which respected the adjudication of settlements prior to the removal of a pauper. Although he had received some opinions favourable to his original idea in that respect, yet the balance of opinions was much against it. He hoped, by yielding to those opinions, the objections to his original bill would be done away, and that considerable good would be produced by it.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0228"/>
<col>425</col>
<p><member>Mr. Shaw Lefevre</member> <membercontribution>begged it to be understood that, in wishing to postpone the business, he acted under no impression whatever of the description alluded to; for no threats whatever should deter him from doing his duty as an independent member of parliament.&#x2014;The bill was then committed <i>pro form&#x00E2;</i>, and ordered to be recommitted on Friday.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[FINANCE COMMITTEE.] The Hon. J. Ward rose</member> <membercontribution>to ask a question relative to a matter of the highest importance. The question related to a transaction which it was reported had taken place in the Army Pay-office, and which had been brought to light by the Committee of Finance. As the circumstance was of the greatest importance in itself, as it very much affected the individual principally concerned, and as it was a matter peculiarly fit to be taken up in that house, he hoped that some member would state, whether the report circulated on this point was or was not well founded?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member> <membercontribution>replied, that the chairman of the finance committee was not in the house, otherwise he would probably have given such an answer to his hon. friend as would satisfy him. Yet as he had sometimes attended that committee, and particularly as he had attended it that day, he was happy to be able to give an answer to the question. He had only to state, that in the course of the examination of a Mr. Thomas, a fact had come out which the committee thought it their duty to investigate with the most scrupulous attention; and, since the discovery alluded to, the committee had accordingly been diligently engaged upon this delicate transaction, and a member of that house, who had been formerly paymaster of the forces, had been carefully examined. What the committee meant to do on this point he did not precisely know, but it was of course to be supposed that they would not dismiss the subject without a full investigation of the matter, and making such a report as their duty and the nature of the case should seem to them to require.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ward</member> <membercontribution>thanked the noble lord for the statement which he had made, and hoped that the committee would make a special report on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[BARRACK COMMISSION.] Lord Henry Petty rose</member> <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, to move for the production of the treasury minute for appointing a barrack Commission, to execute the duties of the barrack-master-general.
<col>426</col>
As he believed there would be no opposition to this motion, he had only to put the house in possession of his object, which would best appear from a statement of facts. Early in the last autumn, the commissioners of military enquiry thought it their duty to communicate to the commissioners of the treasury part of the 4th report, which recommended the appointment of a barrack board, to be substituted instead of a barrack-master-general. The commissioners of the treasury approved of the recommendation, and thought that such a board ought to be appointed. This was communicated to his majesty, who approved of the measure, and affixed his signature to it, and the business might have been completed before the late ministers quitted office; but it had somehow happened that the privy seal was not affixed to the commission, and the noble lord who now held it had not thought proper to affix it. He would not now question the propriety of withholding the seal from it. His object merely was to have the intentions of the late ministry on this point before the house; but he might at least say on this occasion, that he hoped no definitive arrangement would take place till the report of the commissioners had been fully considered. He trusted that the house would seriously consider the report and the method of preventing the recurrence of such abuses as had been found to prevail in this department. He concluded by moving, that the minute of the late commissioners of the treasury, respecting the appointment of a barrack commission, be laid before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said he had no objection to the motion. On coming into office, he had found the case to be exactly as the noble lord had stated it to be. But this matter required great consideration. It appeared that it had been referred to the barrack commissioners and the comptrollers of army accounts, and they had found great difficulty in the business, and therefore it became those who were to be responsible for affixing the privy seal, to be cautious how they appointed persons to offices, and adopted all the arrangements, without an opportunity of fully considering the subject. He certainly had no desire to precipitate measures, but at the same time, the observation of the noble lord did not very well apply here, when he recommended the mature consideration of the report; for he and his colleagues had adopted the measure, before any report at all had been
<image src="S1V0009P0I0229"/>
<col>427</col>
presented. But he agreed to the production of the minute.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member> <membercontribution>in explanation said, that he and his colleagues had fully considered the subject on the report of the Commissioners, and there was this difference between the two cases, that the report was now before the house, whereas then it was not expected to be brought forward for some time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>stated, that two out of the three comptrollers of army accounts concurred in the propriety of the measure.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[LOAN INTEREST BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The house having resolved itself into a committee on this bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said that he had no objection to the interest of the loan being secured for the present year according to the mode pointed out in the plan of the noble lord (H. Petty). He wished, however, to avoid pledging the house to approve of any part of that plan for the future. He was very ready to agree to the first object that was stated, to prevent any new taxation in the present year; he was ready to agree to the 10 per cent. which was created for the interest of the loan of the present year, and the sinking fund; but there were other parts of that very complicated system which required a more ample consideration than could be well bestowed upon it in the course of the present session. There were many objections to the principle of making permanent those taxes which were originally raised as mere war taxes, and making them the fund which was to secure the interest of the loans. He had been well informed, that a considerable degree of sensation and alarm had been excited by the idea of continuing the duties on exports and tonnage after the war, and he thought that was a part of the noble lord's plan which ought not to be persevered in. What he meant now to propose was, that the interest of the loan of this year should now remain on the war taxes as charged in the noble lord's plan; but that six months after the conclusion of peace, unless some other mode were resolved on by parliament, of securing it either by continuing the war taxes for the purpose, or by new taxes, it should then be chargeable on the surplus of the consolidated fund. He trusted, however, that the house would see that enough had already been done in the present session for providing for the interest of the loan of this year without any new taxes; and he should wish to leave the general question open for the enquiry of the house
<col>428</col>
in the next session. The completion of any permanent system must take a considerable time; and since the plan was originally proposed, a great deal of new light had been thrown upon the subject, both in the discussions which took place in and out of that house. He concluded by proposing an amendment to the clause in the bill agreeably to the observations he had thrown out.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>said, that if the loan of the present year were secured in the manner which had been already determined by the resolutions of that house, he could have no objection to adjourn the consideration of the general merits of the plan he had the honour to bring forward to a future time, when it might be submitted to the fullest enquiry, and to the final judgment of parliament. As to the alarm and sensation produced, if any such alarm did exist, it must have proceeded from a misunderstanding of what he had said. He had stated most expressly, that he did not wish to pledge the house to the continuance of any one of those taxes, but that he meant merely to assign that portion of the taxes, which was now represented by the war taxes, as the security of the loan; and to pledge the house only to substitute other taxes for any of those which they might resolve to discontinue. As for what taxes should be continued after the war, and what should be discontinued, he had always stated, and still was of opinion, that the return of peace would be the proper period, in which that subject should be taken into consideration </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton rose </member>, <membercontribution>to enter his protest against the plan of the noble lord, and particularly that part of it which made the income or property tax permanent. He had received a number of letters on the subject of the income tax, and he thought that&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hobhouse </member>, <membercontribution>chairman of the committee, here interrupted the hon. baronet, and told him that the property tax was not mortgaged by the present bill, and had nothing to do with it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>said, that if the hon. baronet would keep his speech for 3 or 4 years, it might possibly then apply to some question relating to the property tax.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>said, that he had no ambition to make a speech upon the subject in three or four years. However, as he now found that the property tax was not mortgaged at present, and that the loan was to be secured on the war duties on customs and excise, he felt that he could not then offer his objections to the property tax.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0230"/>
<col>429</col>
<p><member>Mr. H. Thornton</member> <membercontribution>objected to the principle which had been proposed by the chancellor of the exchequer, of throwing generally upon the consolidated fund a loan which had been contracted for on a different security. He thought that this was not only contrary to all precedent, but to that good faith which parliament owed to the public creditor.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>did not think the principle so very objectionable. By the present plan, the excesses of the consolidated fund were to be applied in a manner different from their original destination, which might as well be called a breach of faith. It appeared to him that it would be giving to the public creditor an additional security.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney</member> <membercontribution>said, that the principle of the right hon. gent. was merely that the war taxes should be security for the interest of the loan, and that after the peace that security was no longer to be continued. There never was before an instance of any loan being secured merely on the future excesses of the consolidated fund. It had happened at different times last war, that there was no surplus, and that was a case which might again occur. Sometimes there was an actual deficiency, and in that case this would provide no security at all for the loan of the present year. He could not conceive any objection to letting the thing stand as it did at present, at least as far as regarded the loan of this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>would have no objection to extend the period to twelve months, after peace, instead of six; in which case parliament must meet, and would have time to decide finally on the subject. He thought nothing could be more objectionable than the principle of the present plan, which went to pledge the house to continue 9&#x00BD; millions of taxes as a security for 12 millions of money. The surplus of the consolidated fund was now 3&#x00BD; millions, and he thought that was a very abundant security. It certainly would be possible to avoid the pledging the whole of the war taxes, by making permanent some of the least objectionable of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney</member> <membercontribution>again protested against looking to a supposed future excess of the consolidated fund as a security. It would be entirely departing from all the principles of finance which had been established in this country. The fact now stood thus: the original bargain with the contractors for the loan was, that it was to be secured on those
<col>430</col>
taxes, and in consequence of that bargain, the ministers received their money, and had it now in their pockets. It was, then, too much now to say, that we would neither give them that security for which they bargained, nor any other security, such as was ever given for a loan, but throw them merely on the chance surplus in the consolidated fund, when peace should be restored.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, that the public creditor was not entitled to more from the war taxes, than a security for the interest of the loan, and for the sinking fund created. As to charging loans on the surplus of the consolidated fund, it was not so extraordinary as had been represented. The chancellor of the exchequer of Ireland (sir John Newport) had charged any deficiency in the product of the sugar tax upon the surplus of the Irish consolidated fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney</member> <membercontribution>said, the arguments of the right hon., for he could no more call him the learned, gent., were such as could not be excused in a man who had been five days chancellor of the exchequer. If he were appealed to as a lawyer, he could not argue that it would be better for his client to have one security than two, and that if he already had two, it would be doing him no injury to take away one of them. There never was an instance of any loan charged upon the consolidated fund without making some increase to it by taxes. If the right hon. gent. would assign 1,200,000<i>l</i>. taxes, for the interest and sinking fund of the loan of this year, he would be content; but if he did not, the contractors had, in common justice, a right to the security for which they originally bargained.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>stated, that the difference in the case of the Irish loan was, that it was secured upon annual, and not upon permanent taxes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer </member> <membercontribution>said, that no absurdity could, in practice, be greater than that of assigning a portion only of the war taxes for the loan. It would be impossible to tell the collectors of the customs or excise, that they must stop collecting the taxes when they had got so much money. He did not, however, now wish to press his amendment, if it did not meet the sense of the house; but it appeared to him that the house had an undoubted right to substitute the security of the consolidated fund for that of any particular taxes </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>said, that, in the present case, there was no substitution at all. The
<image src="S1V0009P0I0231"/>
<col>431</col>
right hon. gent.'s idea would go merely to take from the contractors of the loan one of their securities, without giving them any thing in the place of it. As to the general security of the consolidated fund, and the faith of parliament, they were already possessed of that. The right hon. gent., therefore, appeared to him to wish to take from them the specific security of the war taxes, without giving them any thing else in the place of it.&#x2014;After a variety of explanations, it was resolved to postpone the discussion till to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-04-14">Tuesday, April 14</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>A ballot took place for a committee to determine the merits of the petition complaining of an undue election for Westminster; the following members compose the committee:&#x2014;W. Tuffnell, esq. sir C. W. Bamfylde, sir Jacob H. Astley, lord Porchester, T. Foley, esq. sir H. D. Hamilton, bart. N. Sneyd, esq. G. Campbell, esq sir L. Palke, bart. W. Lushington, esq. A. Hamilton, esq. W. Honeywood, esq. G. Colclough, esq.; nominees, Edward Morris, esq. sir John Doyle. The petitioner having waved his right to appoint a nominee, Mr. Morris was chosen, pursuant to the provisions of the act, by the thirteen members remaining on the reduced list.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[LOAN INTEREST BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The house resolved itself into a committee on the Loan Interest bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, that in compliance with the suggestion thrown out yesterday by the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Tierney), he should not press upon the committee the amendment he had at first intended to propose to the noble lord's plan; at the same time, he could not see how that amendment could have by any possibility given rise to any alarm in the public mind, and furnished any pretext for charging parliament with a breach of public faith in that instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>admitted that it would not have been a substantial breach of faith, inasmuch as the war taxes on customs would have supplied a sufficient surplus, but at the same time contended, that it was anominal breach of public faith, and being totally unnecessary, would be much better let alone, if the ambition of the new chancellor of the exchequer did not prompt him to have some change or other in the plan; to gratify therefore the right hon. gent., he 
<col>432</col>
(lord, II. Petty), should not object to it, as the change did not appear to him to be absolutely mischievous.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney</member> <membercontribution>said, that the new chancellor of the exchequer entertained the newest financial doctrines he had ever heard. The right hon. gent.'s argument went to say, that the consolidated fund was as productive without as with the war taxes. He fancied, however, that the right hon. gent. would have found the plain plodding understanding of the city quite averse to the subtle genius of the right hon. gent. He denied that the intended improvement was given up as an act of grace to his side of the house, for the right hon. gent. while he was driven to an abandonment of it, would fain have the house to understand that he had volunteered in abandoning it.&#x2014;After a short conversation, the amendment was agreed to. The other amendments were then read and agreed to. After which, the house resumed, and the report was ordered to be received to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-04-15">Wednesday, April 15.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>After the names of defaulters on the two last ballots were called over, on the motion of the chancellor of the exchequer, it was ordered, that the members who should be absent at the ballot and call of the house the following day, without a sufficient excuse being assigned, should be taken into the custody of the serjeant at arms.&#x2014;Mr. White then delivered in at the bar the names of the members remaining on the reduced list of the East Looe election committee, which were as follow: lord John Campbell, hon.

Barclay; nominees, W. Jacob, esq. Hiley Addington, esq.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION.] The hon. W. H. Lyttleton rose</member>, <membercontribution>and said, that in prefacing the resolution which he should do himself the honour to move, he would avoid, as much as possible, a repetition of any of the topics that were urged on the important and memorable debate of Thursday last, although so much extraneous matter had on that evening been introduced, that it would be difficult completely to steer clear of such a repetition. On the question that had been then discussed, he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0232"/>
<col>433</col>
must be allowed to say a few words. Deeply did he lament that it had been disposed of in the way in which it had been, not so much on account of the importance of the question itself, important as it undoubtedly was, as because it seemed that the house were disposed to evade the decision of a great constitutional question; a cowardice in the house of commons which affected him beyond expression. By their conduct it appeared as if the house were ready to recognize a principle which would vest in the crown a power clearly unconstitutional because not responsible; a power which differed in nothing from that assumed by the Stuarts, and against which our ancestors had so strenuously and so successfully contended. Not hoping, however, that he could influence the house to change their determination on this subject, he must satisfy himself with submitting to them a resolution which had no direct application to the royal prerogative, and to which he could not but think that the house must accede, when he considered the majorities by which the measures of the late ministers had been supported. The country had seen the sudden and unexpected removal from power, of ministers apparently possessing the full confidence of the house and of the country, and carrying on the affairs of state as prosperously as the situation of Europe would admit. It would be worth while to enquire what was the actual state of Europe, and how far it was of consequence that the affairs of this country should be well conducted. Had the state of Europe been so altered within these few months, had the security of this country become so well established, that we could with safety entrust the administration of it to any set of men whatever? or rather, was it not expedient that an humble and dutiful, but firm remonstrance, should be carried up to the throne against the removal of men, who, in the present circumstances, were the best qualified to hold the helm of state? The ministers whom it had pleased his majesty, or, as our ancestors used to say, whom his majesty had been advised to remove, during the short period of their remaining in office, had done every thing in their power to call forth the energies of the people, and to unite all hands and hearts in the service of the country. Their conduct, considered in every point of view, entitled them to the public esteem and gratitude. In the financial department of the state, one which required such
<col>434</col>
careful management, they not only conducted themselves with economy and discretion, but supported and carried into effect the appointment of a committee of finance, first suggested by an hon. friend of his (Mr. Biddulph), the only apparent means of probing the wounds of the country, and ascertaining the remedy which it would be necessary to apply. In their offer to negotiate with France, while they evinced a spirit of conciliation, they avoided every thing that could be deemed derogatory from the character of this country, and withdrew their ambassador the moment that a continuance in the negociation became inconsistent with the national honour. With regard to the army, they adopted a system conformable to human nature; they had introduced the plan of limited service, which rendered the army more attractive, and which had the tendency to augment its numbers while it exalted its character; nor did they appear at any time disposed to reject any suggestion for amelioration, from whatever quarter it came. As to their successors, we had seen but little of them; but that little was not much to their credit. In some instances their conduct had already been highly censurable. They had called their sovereign to the bar of the house to be arraigned, and then skulked behind the throne, and interposed the royal robe between themselves and merited reproof. He was as loyal as any of them; but by loyalty, he understood allegiance to the state and the constitution, which taught him not to compromise the person of the sovereign, whereas the tendency of their arguments was to render the sovereign himself responsible. He thought, then, that it was necessary, that the house should express its approbation of the conduct of the late ministers, and he thought it the more necessary, as they had been assailed by the most gross and libellous misrepresentations, by minutes committed to venal journalists by perjured counsellors, for the very purposes, as appeared, of misrepresentation, and by a cry about religion, excited from one end of the kingdom to the other, serving to kindle religious animosity, and to awaken the furies of bigotry and fanaticism, to the manifest injury of all true religion. For this cry, he was sorry to say, the chancellor of the exchequer had given the watch-word, and he was almost ashamed of the credulity and blindness of his countrymen, when he saw that there were any with whom such
<image src="S1V0009P0I0233"/>
<col>435</col>
attempts could succeed. He could not conclude without one remark on the threat which had been held out, of a dissolution of parliament, by a right honourable secretary (Mr. Canning), in case the house did not accede to whatever he chose to propose to it, or rather to impose upon it. How often were the members to be sent to their constituents? Was it whenever ministers thought it right to dissolve them upon any pretence, however unreasonable? He was not sent there to cabal, nor to endeavour to impose on his sovereign, even when in opposition to ministers. He would go boldly to his constituents, and call upon them to sanction the vote he had given. Unless they did this, he would at all events only have resigned a trust which it would be dishonourable to hold; but he had no doubt they would sanction it, and ministers, in his opinion, would gain little by a dissolution. If the present resolution was rejected, the house must be considered as only the instrument of the minister of the day. He was not the servile adherent of any man or set of men, and only offered this resolution to the house, because he thought that such a resolution ought to stand on the journals. He concluded by moving, "That this house, considering a firm and efficient administration, as indispensably necessary, in the present important crisis of public affairs, has seen, with the deepest regret, the late change in his majesty's councils."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert rose</member> <membercontribution>to second the motion. Although he had, in the measure regarding the slave trade, uniformly opposed the late administration, yet he was happy in now giving them a proof of his sincere approbation of their general conduct. His hon. friend had given a comprehensive view of the grounds on which the resolution was founded. He presumed that whatever difference of opinion there might be on some subjects, there was no disagreement as to the state of alarm in the present crisis of public affairs. To assert such a proposition, was to procure immediate conviction of its truth. A noble lord on the other side (lord Castlereagh) had said, that the late ministers ascended a bed of roses when they entered into power; but he did no think, now they occupied the same place themselves, they would persevere in that sentiment. If now they should be incommoded by fewer thorns, it would be because some had been extracted by the diligence of the late administration. These were
<col>436</col>
not times in which the public service would admit of trifling: the reins of the state must be held by a firm hand, or the most painful consequences were to be apprehended. An opening for peace presented itself, which, according to the opinion of the people of England, was not to be neglected; they made the proper advances, and the attempt, however unsuccessful, was meritorious. An attempt to obstruct the power of our great enemy had been tried ineffectually, by a formidable co-operation of the continental powers, and a peace was discreetly attempted, to prevent new disappointments. In regard to the army and navy, the measures the late servants of the crown pursued, were at once constitutional, and directed to increase these two sources of the national defence. As to the army, the mode adopted for its improvement had been argued as a military expedient by those who were much more competent to determine on its policy than he was; yet, on the ordinary principles of common sense, the measures appeared to his mind reasonable, and that they were constitutional, he had no doubt; he felt great gratitude to those who proposed them, as they were manifestly conducive to remove the evil so much feared by our ancestors, he meant the existence of a large standing army; and he earnestly entreated of the ministers now in power, that they would not in this respect introduce those changes which might in the sequel be subversive of the constitution. In regard to the navy, there was at least one indication of its good management, since there was no period of our late protracted wars in which fewer captures had been made. If he were to proceed further and to examine the positions of the squadrons expanded over the seas, new proofs would be supplied of the politic conduct in that important department. With respect to the finances, it was seen that the greatest economy had been applied, although perhaps the great capitalists of the country were among those who were the least satisfied with the arrangements. Discontent under such circumstances was in human nature, and could not be separated from it. It was impossible that there should not be a predilection with persons of large fortune, in favour of those who would enable them to employ it to the greatest advantage. But although he would not depreciate men of great pecuniary resources, yet there was a middle order of men who had patiently sustained the burthen of this expensive war,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0234"/>
<col>437</col>
and who would do their utmost to sustain it, as long as they had confidence in those who directed his majesty's councils: that class of men would perceive, that the plan laid down by the late ministers was calculated to relieve them, under such extraordinary pressure, and would feel mortified and disheartened when it was abandoned. Had not these advisers of the crown met every enquiry into their financial system with a manly and temperate spirit, in order to adopt every improvement, and to give the fullest satisfaction to those who were to sustain the heat and labour of the day? In this situation of things, his friends, who had retired from office, had carried with them the approbation of their own consciences, confirmed by the respect and gratitude of their country. It had been asserted, that the late administration had been inactive, in not affording to our allies the assistance they expected. He granted, that they had not subsidized the nations of Europe, as had been done on former occasions, but they had acted more wisely; and by stationing the naval force in proper directions, they had must powerfully co-operated with those who defended the common cause. He was astonished to hear it said, that there might be an exercise of the royal prerogative, for which no one could, or ought to be responsible. If it might be so in one instance, it might be so in all cases, and nothing could be inure unconstitutional than such a principle. With regard to loyalty, the term itself was too tame and cold to express that empassioned attachment which a British subject felt towards his sovereign. His majesty had constantly shewn his attention to the interest and happiness of his people, and his veneration for the constitution of the country; yet the subject would be in danger of losing the best character of his loyalty, and the most important part of his honourable immunities, if he were not to be permitted to question the exercise of the royal prerogative. On a late occasion, the king's ministers recommended a measure which had recently received much discussion; he alluded to the concession to the Catholics in the army and navy. This was not brought forward, that gentlemen might indulge themselves in fine speeches: it was introduced to tranquillize the mind of the subject, in a particular part of the realm; and when from opposition, either at home or abroad, that important design was to be disappointed, it was consistent with every
<col>438</col>
notion he could form of wisdom and duty to withdraw it. They did this, however, with the proper reservation, that their opinions should be unbiassed and unfettered, that they should be allowed to declare that they had not abandoned their former sentiments, and that when the occasion should testify it, they might be permitted again to submit to their royal master the propriety or necessity of such a measure. This appeared to him to be a fair and respectful proceeding, but they could not condescend to become time serving ministers, or to barter the interests of their country for the power and emoluments of office. It was said, that the king could dismiss his ministers at his pleasure, and that therefore there could be no ground for demanding the pledge. Into that he should not enquire, but it was perfectly clear to him that ministers could not constitutionally enter into such an engagement. They could not be restricted in the advice they should give to the crown; they were the guardians of the country, and must respect the relation they sustained to it. He would assert yet more&#x2014;that, had they acceded to time pledge, such ministers would have been the proper objects of parliamentary impeachment. The new ministers were said to be confined by no such pledge, but he would contend that they were pledged by the very act of undertaking their present situations. Supposing the concession that had been proposed to the Catholics, should be necessary to preserve the rights of the crown, and the tranquillity of the people, was it to be expected that, contrary to truth, they should come to the house and declare, that they were erroneous in their judgment? He commended them for avowing, in an open and manly way, their sentiments; and their withdrawing the bill was capable of complete vindication, since the contrary would have given rise to serious divisions at this critical moment. Both he and the whole nation must prefer this conduct to that of accepting office under a disguised pledge, which was made sufficiently manifest from the minute which had been laid upon the table. If nothing which had fallen from his hon. friend, or from himself, in this debate, should induce the house to declare its confidence in the late administration, he hoped, at least, it would not be prevented from this bold acknowledgment of its feelings, by the indiscreet threat of the right hon. secretary (Mr. Canning), to advise his majesty to dissolve the parliament. He would confidently assert, that there was no
<image src="S1V0009P0I0235"/>
<col>439</col>
example of such a menace. Was it to be considered as a specimen of the talents of the new secretary for the arduous duties of his office, in which station he had succeeded a noble lord of extraordinary powers, and who was the follower of an illustrious statesman, who, to the greatest suavity of manners, united the greatest strength and dignity of intellect. He hoped that the right hon. secretary would not suppose he meant any personal disrespect to him; without any intention of that kind, he was discharging what he conceived to be an imperious constitutional duty. He might think as humbly of himself as any man: he might sacrifice in his private capacity all the emotions of pride; but the honour of that house was a sacred trust which could not be resigned, which must not be stigmatized with impunity; and if the right hon. secretary's threat were to be patiently endured, the constitution of our ancestors must soon be surrendered.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Milnes </member>, <membercontribution>in a maiden speech, opposed the motion. Although the question and the observations to which it had given rise, extended to the detail of all the acts of the late administration, it ought yet to be recollected that most of those acts had before been singly considered and approved of by the house. Before he proceeded he would make one observation on the form of the resolution, which did not appear to him to be calculated to include in the concurrence to it all those whom the hon mover must certainly be desirous to include. It contained this proposition, that because the late administration might in many points have deserved well of the country, yet that their dismissal was not expedient or necessary. Did it follow that, because the house, or any member of the house, had approved of part of the conduct of the late ministers, they must necessarily extend their approbation to that part of their conduct which occasioned their dismissal? Certainly not; and the hon. mover must therefore forfeit the support of those who, while they applauded the late ministry in several points of their administration, were not disposed to give to that administration their unqualified approbation. He would not, on this occasion, go into an examination of the merits of the late administration, or of the circumstances which led to their dismissal. A particular review of their public acts, few as they had been, it would require more than one night to accomplish, and a general review might be productive
<col>440</col>
of a delusive inference. Whether the war had been carried on with the activity which the affairs of Europe demanded? Whether every possible means had been used to excite the energies of the people at home? Whether the financial system had been arranged with ability? Whether recent accusations against a gallant officer (sir Home Popham) had been prompted by private prejudice rather than by public duty? These were points on which he would not presume to determine. With regard to the measure so honourable to humanity, which had at length been carried into effect, the abolition of the slave trade (although the stigma of having allowed it to remain so long could never be effaced), the glory of that measure belonged to his hon. friend (Mr. Wilberforce), in whose philanthropy it originated, and by whose unwearied exertions it had at length been brought to a successful issue. That the late administration possessed ability he was ready to allow, but that ability, however great, by no means stultified their opponents, whose measures, if calculated, as he was convinced they would be, for the advantage of the country, the house, he trusted, would not suffer to be impeded by the operation of party spirit. With regard to what had been termed the threat of a right hon. secretary, he had said nothing, that could be new to the house; expectations of a dissolution had been very generally formed. Was the absence of disguise censurable? Besides,the right hon. gent. did not make use of the expression which had been alluded to as a threat; those alone converted it into a threat who insinuated that by any declaration from any man, the house of commons could be deterred from doing their duty. With respect to the conduct of the present administration, he was confident that by an anxious desire to obtain peace, if an honourable peace were attainable; if an honourable peace were not attainable, by a vigorous prosecution of the war, in conjunction with our allies; by a wise and persevering attention to the proper management of the domestic concerns of the country, and by that eloquence which would enable them to refute their antagonists, and to maintain the excellence of their own measures, his majesty's present ministers would secure an influence in the house, over which the violence of opposition would be unable to triumph. To what did the present motion tend? Not to shew that the house approved of several parts of the conduct of the late ministers, 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0236"/>
<col>441</col>
for that approbation had been expressed by their votes. Not to inform the king of their merits, for, according to the statement made by a noble lord, his majesty had expressed his approbation of their conduct up to the circumstance which led to their dismissal. The house had not been told of the answer which had been made to the approbation so expressed by the sovereign. Would it not have been proper for the late ministers, on quitting office, to assure his majesty that in retiring from his service, it was their wish still to support his government; that they should be happy at having the power to afford it their aid; that they knew their dismissal was occasioned by conscientious motives alone; and that, so far from shewing any animosity against their successors, they were disposed by every possible means to contribute to the success of those measures which they might bring forward for the service of the country? Discarded from his majesty's councils, they should retain their respect to the monarch, and their affection to their country. By such motives they ought to be influenced; at least, he hoped they would not madly surrender themselves to a blind and headlong opposition; and that their friends and adherents would have the modesty to suspend their condemnation of the new ministers, until some opportunity should have been afforded of witnessing their conduct; or, in other words, until they had been tried. No doubt could arise on the terms in which the resolution was expressed; its general purport could not be misunderstood. Before, an abstract point was to be discussed; now, the words were more clear and precise, and precluded the possibility of any misapprehension. Such were the sentiments he had to express on the present occasion. He was anxious that a temper of conciliation should prevail; and he should be sorry if the late ministers could not have the dignity to retire from their stations, without repining at those who had succeeded them. Whatever might be the influence of the speeches of the two hon. gentlemen upon others, upon his mind they had no effect but to increase his objections to what they had recommended; he should therefore conclude with moving the order of the day.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Hon. John W. Ward rose</member> <membercontribution>and spoke as follows:&#x2014;I can assure the house, sir, that it is not without considerable reluctance that I rise for the purpose of occupying any portion of their time, however small. But as the question now before us
<col>442</col>
is of great magnitude, and as I had no opportunity of stating my sentiments upon one which was brought forward some days ago, and which if not in form, at least in its understood purpose, and in the way it was discussed, resembled this, I trust I shall be excused if I say a few words. Indeed, sir, I hardly know how I should discharge my duty either towards myself, or towards the country, one of whose representatives I am, if I were to refrain from expressing any opinion at all upon a change so extraordinary as that which we have lately witnessed, particularly as that opinion must be at once the guide and the pledge of my conduct in parliament, perhaps for as long as I have the honour to sit in it.&#2014;But before I touch upon these points with which it is connected, I beg to be clearly understood, as to what has been made the subject of so much wilful and malignant misrepresentation. No pains have been spared, and no falsehoods have been abstained from, in order to convince the people, that the late ministers were inclined to avail themselves of what, it seems, they fancied was the secure and permanent possession of power, in order to thwart the wishes and insult the feelings of their sovereign; and that their friends in both houses of parliament are prepared to support them in this line of conduct, and are consequently the enemies both of his person and his prerogative.&#x2014;Now for my own part I solemnly declare, that if I could see any thing in their conduct that could warrant such a suspicion, if I could see any thing inconsistent with the most, delicate regard for his individual feelings, and the most profound and constitutional reverence for his authority, I should be among the first to desert and to reprobate them. No man can feel more deeply than I do, the respect with which every good Englishman ought to approach the throne, nor am I at all inclined to countenance those subtle distinctions between the person and the office, which might tend to weaken a sentiment so closely interwoven with the very frame of our constitution. With regard to his present majesty, I am as sensible as any one of what is due to a monarch so venerable by his age, by the long period during which he has reigned over this great empire, and, more than all, by his piety and virtues. I have thought it necessary to say thus much in limine, in order to exonerate myself from a charge which has been so diligently disseminated by anonymous libellers out of doors, profes-

sing, falsely, no doubt, to speak the sentiments of the present ministers, but which, I flatter myself, no member of this house will be uncandid enough to impute either to the friends of the late government, or to the late government itself, which contained among its leading members, some of the oldest and most faithful servants of the crown, to whom his majesty neither made nor even hinted the slightest reproach of that kind upon dismissing them from office.&#x2014;It is of the utmost importance that the late ministers should stand well with the public as to that transaction, and I am perfectly willing to declare, that I would on no account concur in a vote conveying a general approbation of their conduct, if it appeared that in the course of it they had acted in a manner inconsistent with their duty. But, fortunately for themselves, and fortunately for the country, nothing can be more clear, more concise, and more satisfactory, than the whole history of those circumstances which ended in their dismission. When stripped of those details by which, though curious and interesting in themselves, the substance of it is not affected, it is, in one word, this: His majesty's ministers proposed to the house, in their ministerial capacity, a measure for which they imagined they had his consent. It turned out however upon further communication, that it had been given upon a misunderstanding of the real nature of the bill. They immediately withdrew it. But his majesty having accompanied his dissent by a very singular demand&#x2014;namely, that they should give in writing a promise never to mention the subject to him again, they felt themselves obliged to acquaint him, in a firm, but respectful manner, that their sense of duty would not allow them to abstain from offering to him from time to time, such advice upon this and all other subjects, as his interests, and the interests of his empire, might in their judgement require. Upon this, his majesty resolved to dismiss them his service&#x2014;following, no doubt, the advice of most disinterested persons, of persons who were not to profit by the change, and who had no other object at heart than to give to their country the strongest and wisest government that could be formed, at a time of the greatest danger by which it was ever menaced!&#x2014;Now, sir, in all this, I can see no insolence, no folly, no desire to insult their sovereign, no deep-laid plot for making themselves Mayors of the Palace, nothing that could endanger
<col>444</col>
the establishment and call upon the right hon. and learned gent. opposite me to desert that profession of which he was an ornament, to quit the study of the year-book for that of your finance reports, and to take upon himself the lucrative office of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, for life if he could, or if not for life, for so long as he can hold it, in order, I presume, the better to enable him to make that gallant stand for the religion of his country, of which he has himself made such honourable mention in his address to his constituents.&#x2014;And now, sir, that I have mentioned this address, I cannot forbear stating to the house, the impression it made upon my wind, and which it was, naturally, though I am sure unintentionally, calculated to produce. If I had merely seen such a paper in circulation, without any name annexed to it, and if I had been to judge of the author by the paper, and not of the paper by the author, I should have said, without hesitation, that it proceeded, not as it really did, from a man of blameless character and honourable intentions, not from an eminent lawyer, not from a minister of the crown, but from some mischievous and desperate incendiary, urged by fanaticism or the hope of plunder, to rekindle among us the flame of religions discord, and to renew in every town in the kingdom, those disgraceful scenes that were acted here in the year 1780.&#x2014;But to return to the late ministers: The fact is, that they sacrificed their own wishes and their own feelings to the feelings and wishes of their sovereign&#x2014;they gave up all they could give up without disgracing themselves in his eyes, and, in those of all the world&#x2014;every thing but consistency, every thing but principle, every thing but honour; these they neither could nor did abandon. To deal quite fairly with the house, as I shall always feel myself bound to do, even at the certainty of differing from, and the hazard of offending those for whom I have most esteem and most regard, I must confess, that if there is any thing in the course of this transaction for which I should be inclined to cast blame upon the late ministers, it would be upon grounds very different from those that have generally been taken. That they went far enough in concession, I am quite sure&#x2014;my only doubt is, whether they did not go too far. I am inclined to think that upon the strict principles of better times, of times more favourable to the people&#x2014;and when I use the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0238"/>
<col>445</col>
word people, I mean to include every thing that is not the creature of court influence and court intrigue.&#x2014;I am inclined to think, that, according to the doctrines so long and successfully maintained by our ancestors, the proper moment for resignation was that in which his majesty was advised to demand the total abandonment of the Catholic bill, and that they ought not to have waited for the pledge, that last insult which their enemies were already preparing for them in the dark. If such had been their determination, I, for one, should cheerfully have stood by them and been content to abide the consequences. But I am not disposed to urge this point too far:&#x2014;perhaps there is something in the nature of the times in which we live, and of those deplorable prejudices which it has been the singular effect of the French revolution to revive, by a sort of re-action upon the fears of the tranquil and well-disposed part of society, just at the moment when they were gradually but rapidly falling into utter contempt, which would have rendered this an imprudent step even with a view to the object it was designed to promote, the people it was intended to serve, and to better purposes than a mere continuance in office&#x2014;perhaps it would have enabled their adversaries to excite against them a foolish and mistaken clamour, the mischiefs of which can be best estimated by those who, like myself, consider their popularity with the great mass of the people, and their ultimate return to power, as the only remaining hope of the friends to religious liberty, to civil freedom, and to the constitution of this country.&#x2014;And now, sir, to say a few words as to their general conduct: &#x2014;I regret this change much, because it has deprived the king and the country of a strong, able, and patriotic government&#x2014;I regret it still more, because it has replaced it by one directly the converse of it in all respects.&#x2014;I believe, sir, that no government ever did so much for the good of the people in so short a time. Their merits have been stated in detail already, and will probably be stated again by persons far better qualified for the task, both by their authority and talents, than I am. I will however take the liberty of again calling to the mind of the house, those steps towards a reform in the public expenditure which were taken by the noble lord lately at the head of the treasury, and by my noble friend near me. They afford a rare, but brilliant and successful example of a
<col>446</col>
government anxiously and earnestly endeavouring to check abuses, and to save the money of the people, even at the hazard of diminishing their own patronage and power. An hon. gent. (Mr. Huskisson), I perceive, smiles at this assertion;&#x2014;I can assure him, however, that I should be perfectly content to put the cause of the late government upon no other ground than the integrity, disinterestedness, and ability they displayed in this instance. I would also remind gentlemen of that plan of finance, (the work of the same persons,) on the details I am by no means prepared to give an opinion, but the effect of which, in some most important particulars, are evident to all the world.&#x2014;After a long period of most expensive war, it has saved us from the necessity of imposing fresh taxes for several years to come, and, I will venture to say, has by that means alone done more than any single act of any former administration to keep up the spirits of the people in this singular and alarming posture of affairs, and to inspire them with confidence as to the final result of the struggle in which they have been so long engaged. It remains to be seen by which of those excellent, no doubt, but not very consistent or very clearly explained schemes which were opposed to it by the present ministers, the plan of my noble friend is to be replaced, and indeed whether the execution of that or any other plan will not be rendered impossible by the waste of millions to rouse unwilling cabinets to premature and ruinous exertions.&#x2014;It remains to be seen by how much English gold, that is by how much English labour, and in the present circumstances of the country, by how much English privation and misery, it may be deemed expedient to purchase another third day's <i>victory</i> at Austerlitz. Whenever it occurs, I trust that the same able hand will be employed in communicating it to the public, and that my learned friend and namesake, who can so easily persuade, first himself, and then the world, that a complete defeat was in fact a complete success, will be had down by a special retainer from the Admiralty to the Foreign office, for that particular purpose. We have at least one peculiar advantage in the management of our financial affairs. The present chancellor of the exchequer brings to the subject, a mind free and unbiassed: he is encumbered by no former pledges or opinions, never having, as far as I know, touched at all upon finance during the long period in which he has
<image src="S1V0009P0I0239"/>
<col>447</col>
been as to every thing else, so active and so distinguished a member of parliament.&#x2014;Sir, I have been the more desirous to direct the attention of the house to the financial part of the late administration, because I am persuaded, that the purity and severity they displayed in that respect, contributed indirectly to their fall, and will prove a direct obstacle to their return to power. They were too sparing of the public money, and too vigilant in their enquiries into abuse not to be an object of aversion to the whole class of jobbers, defaulters, and political adventurers. These persons felt themselves in a painful state of fear and depression, and exposed to inexorable vigilance and scrutiny. The dissolution of the late ministry has delivered them from all their terrors. The good old times are returned, "redeunt Saturnia regna," and they anticipate a long period of laxity, corruption, and impunity. The new ministers know how much support has been thrown away on that side by their predecessors, and how much may be gained by themselves, and accordingly they have not lost a moment in shewing them "some token for good." What must be the satisfaction of the whole class on seeing that nobleman restored to the councils of his sovereign, who in what, I believe, was called his defence, but which to me appeared so much more like a confession of guilt, declared openly and boldly to us, the guardians of the national purse, that of a large sum of public money which had passed through his hands, he would render no account whatever?&#x2014;What a glorious set-off against the committee of finance, the commission for auditing the public accounts, and all the other vexatious measures of the late penurious government! With what rapture they must hail the triumph that has just been obtained by their tutelary deity over the efforts of the friends of reform, over the feelings of the country, and over the dignity and authority of this house!&#x2014;The abolition of the slave trade was not, strictly speaking, a cabinet measure, and therefore cannot fairly be made a part of their encomium in their ministerial capacity. However, the friends of that great measure of justice and policy, would do well to consider what chance there would have been of accomplishing it under the present administration, which contains almost every individual (with very few exceptions) connected with public life, by whom it was always opposed, and treated as a chimerical
<col>448</col>
and pernicious speculation.&#x2014;During the same government of 13 months, a plan was brought forward, and almost accomplished, for the better administration of justice in Scotland. No impartial person who has been in that country, and who is aware of the daily increasing inconveniences both to the judges and the suitors, arising from the present form of the courts, can hesitate as to the necessity of some change; yet no former government ever had the diligence, the wisdom, or the courage to attempt what became an immediate object of attention to the late ministers.&#x2014;With regard to the persons by whom they have been succeeded, I am not desirous to state my sentiments much in detail, both because a good deal has been said already, and because it is a pleasanter task to praise than to blame. I cannot however avoid declaring, that whether I look at the means by which they have acquired power, or the means by which they must retain it, if they retain it at all, I consider their administration as the greatest calamity that has befallen the country since the breaking up of lord Chatham's ministry, in 1763&#x2014;a transaction which this resembles in some of its most striking features, and particularly as being the result of that secret influence, of which that great man never ceased to complain, and which deprived us of his services at the highest point of his usefulness and reputation, and cut him short in the full career of his own, and of England's glory.&#x2014;The house has been already reminded that these are the gentlemen who were seized with a sudden panic, and abandoned the government, almost immediately upon the death of Mr. Pitt, whose illustrious name was justly considered as forming the only ornament and support of their administration. It must be confessed, however, to their credit, that in their retreat they complied most honourably with the rules of ancient war; they did not suffer the "spolia opima" of the departed hero to fall into the hands of the enemy. His faithful myrmidons kept the field till they had fairly taken possession of his sinecure, and then retired. They have however sprung upon us again from a sort of ambush, and regained possession of their former position. They have accomplished this, by means of a successful appeal to a particular opinion entertained by his majesty, an opinion with which many of them are known so little to agree, that they thought it necessary upon a former occasion, to give up their places, because they
<image src="S1V0009P0I0240"/>
<col>449</col>
could not carry a measure in direct opposition to it. And there is this remarkable difference between their case and the case of the late ministers, that they demanded the whole of what is called "Catholic emancipation," and refused to serve the king any longer because he would not grant it, whilst the late ministers asked only a part of that measure, a very small part, and one that had been already promised by their predecessors, and what is still more important, were content to abandon that part to the wishes of their sovereign.&#x2014;Sir, the present government owe their power to a dark intrigue, and not to any general opinion in their favour; and they must retain it by those means which are always resorted to, in order to supply the want of pubic confidence. Among these, I understand we may reckon a profose distribution of honours, which, without any proportionate advantage to the popular part of the constitution, degrades the aristocracy, and at the same time weakens the crown. Indeed, the way these gentlemen have taken to shew their attachment to their sovereign is altogether singular; they begin by advising him to require his ministers to violate their oath, and, in so doing, to make a direct attack upon that part of the constitution on which his personal security, principally depends: they then ask him to give them their places for life, that is, to make these completely independent of him, and out of the reach of any change in his opinion as to their merits; and lastly, they desire him to corder as many honours upon their friends at one blow, as would form, if properly managed, a source of influence for 10 years to come; that is, in order to confirm Ins authority, they persuade him to mortgage and anticipate the resources from which it is derived.&#x2014;Sir, I will not abuse the indulgence of the house, by taking up more of their time: before I sit down I will however say a single word as to another intended step of the present government; I mean the use of a prerogative of the crown, an undoubted prerogative indeed; but the exercise of which, in this particular instance, and in the actual circumstances of the country, would, I will not hesitate to say, be the most audacious, the most desperate, and the most revolutionary measure that has taken place in England for a century past. This step has even been held out in terrorem by the right hon. secretary, in order to influence the vote of a
<col>450</col>
former night. With what decency, and with what good sense, I leave the house itself to determine. We all of us remember Mr. Pitt, the greatest and proudest minister this country ever saw, sitting in the place where the right hon. secretary now sits; a man whose commanding genius and irresistible eloquence might have excused a somewhat too high tone of authority: but Mr. Pitt himself, in the zenith of his power and glory, a power which even a dissolution of parliament will hardly give to the present ministers, and a glory which will hardly be rivalled even by the present first lord of the treasury; even he always treated the house of commons with respect, nor did he so far lose his temper, and along with it his prudence and his sense of propriety, as to threaten at the conclusion of a debate, when he apprehended that the vote of the evening was not likely to satisfy him, to appeal to the country, and send us back to our constituents. Sir, I trust that the house will treat this menace with proper indignation and contempt, and that it will shew by its decision this night, that it knows how to appreciate those ministers, who are, by their own confession, unable to maintain their ground a single moment, except by expedients which a strong government would despise, and of which a good government would be ashamed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hawkins Browne</member> <member>did not think that any ground had been afforded by the present ministers, in consequence of any act of theirs, for a remonstrance against them. They had all served his majesty before the present time with fidelity, why then should they be stigmatised by anticipation? they had given proofs of talent, and fully justified the favourable opinion entertained of them on former occasions; was it fair, then, to dismiss them now without a trial? He had great respect for the late ministers; but their successors certainly did not yield to them in public spirit, integrity, or virtue, and were superior to them in constitutional feelings and conduct. The late ministers meant well, he had no doubt, but they proceeded sometimes to extremes, He felt astonished at the panegyric pronounced on them for financial economy and financial system; but the house would recollect, that the whole merit of their plan should be attributed to Mr. Pitt. It was his sinking fund which enabled the late administration to form those arrangements respecting finance for which they claimed the thanks of the country. The present chancellor of the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0241"/>
<col>451</col>
exchequer was alluded to sarcastically as having left the inns of court and his profession for the arduous office which he held; and from the circumstance of having been lately a professional man, it was inferred that he could not be fit for his present situation. The best answer to this cavil was, that Mr. Pitt, the greatest financier this country ever saw, had stepped, he might say, from Lincoln's Inn to the treasury, at the head of which he presided, with credit to himself, and advantage to the country. He did not conceive, therefore, any reason for imputing incapacity, on the ground just stated, to his right hon. friend (Mr. Perceval). Gentlemen seemed to lay great stress on the pledge required by his majesty. This at the utmost was only an implied engagement that they would not offend his majesty by the introduction of a measure repugnant to his feelings.</member></p>
<p><member>Mr. Macdonald</member> <membercontribution>could not refrain from returning thanks to the hon. mover, for the opportunity which he afforded him of expressing his opinion of the integrity and meritorious conduct of the late ministers. This would be an easy task, and might be done in a few words; but under the circumstances of the country at this moment, the question could not rest here, for it involved the public interest and public opinion which should be regarded, notwithstanding the menaces of a dissolution of parliament The house would feel that this was a moment of the greatest anxiety in every point of view. We were engaged in a most expensive war against the most formidable enemy this country had ever encountered; it was a moment at which our great northern ally was looking towards us for support and confidence; it was a juncture at which the eyes of Europe were turned to our situation Under these circumstances, what was so necessary as that we should be all united heart and hand, in the great cause we had undertaken? What more desirable than a firm, determined, efficient government, capable of calling forth our resources, and directing them against the enemy? The late ministers had done all in their power to promote the interest, and maintain the honour of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tighe</member> <membercontribution>felt it to be his duty, as belonging to that part of the empire where the dismissal of the late ministry was a subject of deep and universal regret, to state his opinion on the question before the house. In whatever light he viewed the conduct of that administration during the short time
<col>452</col>
they were in power, it was entitled to his approbation. Whether he considered their economy in the public expenditure, their probity in the arrangement of the finances, their firmness, vigour, and decision in the conduct of the war, the general rectitude of their conduct in every other branch of administration, he found that they were titled to his unqualified approbation. They had, it was true, been but a short time in power, but it was long enough to deserve the thanks and gratitude of the nation. They had governed long enough for their own glory, but, unfortunately, not long enough to promote and confirm the advantages of their country. They continued in power, "satis sibi, sed non patri&#x00E6; Considering the principle upon which the present ministers came in, it was impossible he could give them his support. For what was that principle? Most certainly, it was either upon an express or implied pledge not to stir a great constitutional question. If they did not come in under a written pledge, assuredly they did under a virtual pledge, not to advise his majesty upon the Catholic question. Accepting office upon these terms, what confidence could they hope from the people of Ireland? It was well known that hopes were held out to the Catholics of Ireland previous to the Union, that whenever that great measure should be effected, their claims would be heard and discussed with temper here. Were it not for these promises, the union would never have been carried, In order to procure the concurrence of the Catholics, the bishops were made the instruments of influencing the priests, and the priests were bribed to cajole the people. The present administration brought with them into power, all the odious parts of Mr. Pitt's principles with regard to Ireland, and super-added the principle of eternal exclusion to the Catholics, Ireland, at present, might be considered as a paralized member of the political body. It affected the whole frame; but, let it be restored to life and vigour, and the cripple would throw away his crutch, and grasp the sword in defence of his benefactor. As to concessions to Catholics, he was astonished at the inconsistency which prevailed with regard to them. He was at a loss to discover why principles, which were admitted in framing the constitution of Canada, should be considered as subversive of the constitution in Ireland. He was happy in the opportunity of expressing his approbation of the conduct of the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0242"/>
<col>453</col>
late ministers, and of condemning the principles upon which the present administration came into power.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Robinson</member> <membercontribution>said that when the hon. gent. attacked the measure of the union between the two countries, he seemed to overlook the consideration, that the noble lord (Grenville) Who was at the head of the late government, was one of the persons most forward in carrying that measure into effect. He felt sorry he could not assent to the motion of his hon. friend; a motion which he had introduced in a manner creditable to himself; and there was no man in the house more ready to give credit to his motives than he was. There were some points on which he could not feel inclined to support the late administration. In their military measures, he could see nothing but speculative plans and fallacious hopes. They had totally and completely ruined the volunteer system, by their inattention and disregard; and there was left no moral possibility of now ascertaining the discipline and force of that establishment. The next point on which he could not support them, was, their conduct relative to the catholic question. In his opinion they had imprudently encouraged expectations which they could not gratify, and were now predicting evil consequences, which he did not think the circumstances warranted. He thought the house might fairly expect, that the government of the duke of Richmond would be as popular and as lenient as that of lord Hardwicke. The late ministerial changes he regretted upon general grounds; yet still he could not accede to the proposition of condemning their successors by anticipation, and much less, when he recollected the peculiar circumstances under which they were called to the councils of their sovereign.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Gore</member> <membercontribution>said, he had the honour of being a representative of a great and populous county in the sister island. Some months back, every thing was peaceable, and the people well affected; within the last month, no less than four murders had taken place, and a number of individuals had been arrested for treasonable practices. He trusted, that when the present ministers should retire from office, the house and the country would not be obliged to witness similar proofs of their policy and measures. The bill which opened the military service to the Catholics, had his warmest support; a support which he would have continued, had the late ministers persisted in carrying
<col>454</col>
it through its stages. It was true that the Catholics of Ireland looked to the late ministers as their staunchest friends, as those characters upon whom they might fully and confidently depend for the complete fulfilment of their promises and sanguine expectations. But the late administration must deceive themselves grossly, if they imagined that the measure they proposed was of a nature and extent to gratify the claims of that body. No; the Catholics considered it only as an excuse for ministers not redeeming their numerous pledges; they estimated it as a paltry subterfuge to escape expected solicitations. Had the late ministers been sincere in their regard for Ireland; had they really been inclined to promote its happiness and to augment its comforts, they could have embraced many opportunities of extending the benefits of education and knowledge. Had they come forward with that great and inestimable blessing, which would have taught the brave but ignorant peasantry of that country to choose between real good and airy speculation? Had they endeavoured to rescue them from those numerous evils which result from the collection of tithes in that country, and thus preserve them from that variety of distress to which the present system has long committed them? In a word, what one act had they done to ameliorate the condition of the people of that ill-used country? a country, the brightest gem in the British crown, and of which, in the words of the poet, he would say,
<quote>"Long from a nation, ever hardly us'd, At random censur'd, wantonly abus'd, Have Britons drawn their strength."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Roscoe</member> <membercontribution>began with considering the great and important good consequences that must have resulted from the adoptions of any measure that went, in the present crisis, to conciliate the people of Ireland, and to the truth of such a principle he required no stronger testimony than that of the hon. gent. who had just sat down. As to the bill in its original form, he could not conceive what objection could be urged against doing that in those times, when the idea of a Popish ascendancy was laughed at, which was done when such a motion was really formidable. He could not for his part understand the distinction which had been attempted to be set up between the subjects of the king of these realms. His majesty, no doubt, expected allegiance from each and every of his subjects; it was but reasonable that each of those subjects 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0243"/>
<col>455</col>
should expect their due share of constitutional privileges. As to its great impolicy in taking from the national strength, it had been argued, by a right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Perceval) upon a former night, that if the army and navy were so crowded with Catholics, the service did not suffer by reason of their political disabilities e but was it no discouragement to a set of men in any profession, to know that they were for ever prohibited from acquiring the ordinary rewards of perseverance, ability, and zeal? As to the present ministry, he could not give them his confidence. Had they never been tried, he should object to them on the principles upon which they had succeeded to power. It had been asked, why condemn men before they have been tried? He thought they had been tried, and tried sufficiently; they had been "tried in the balance, and found wanting." In the debate on the grant of the duchy of Lancaster, some comparisons had been made between the present and the late chancellor of the exchequer; there was no point of view in which the contrast appeared to him to be stronger, than in the disinterestedness of the noble lord, and in the very interested manner in which the right hon. gent. appeared to him to have been seduced into the hazard of supporting the new administration. Much, had been said about the alledged impropriety of introducing the king's name into a discussion of this kind: if this was a crime, it was in his mind, attributable solely to his majesty's present ministers; for what did they say&#x2014;they admit the pledge to be unconstitutional&#x2014;they admit, first, that it was wrong to demand such a pledge, and then they contend that in demanding that pledge, the king acted for himself, and without any advisers whatever: this certainly appeared to him to be a very curious way of defending their royal master.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>rose and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;it was my intention, Mr. speaker, to have immediately replied to the observations of the hon. gent. who spoke last but one. I felt anxious to have commented on some statements which fell from him, with a view of answering those charges which he attempted to insinuate against the late servants of the crown. If upon those charges I shall be able to do what I think I shall, then do I trust for his vote, then do I call upon him to support those very measures, the supposed non-performance of which he has, this night, stated to be the
<col>456</col>
causes of his objection to the late administration. Certain that I shall be able fully to convince him on these points, I now feel it my duty to call him back to that opinion, which, to my knowledge, he entertained within the last month, with respect to the national services performed by the late servants of the crown, and to the probable and practical benefits which would result from their administration. How this transformation in his opinion has taken place, I am at a loss to ascertain; but if it be only founded on the allegations which he has this night advanced, I can feel no difficulty in bringing the-hon. gent. back to his former sentiments. He has told the house, that he did expect, from the late administration, on their coming into power, an immediate attention to the diffusion of education amongst the population of Ireland. He asserted, that it would be difficult for them to prove that any endeavour was made to support the condition of the people of Ireland, by an amelioration of the system of mental improvement. In answer, I call upon him to look to the statute book, to refer to that act of the legislature which constituted a commission for the express purpose of enquiring into and completely sifting the gloss misapplication of those funds, which were particularly set apart, and specifically intended, for supporting a system of national education; an act, the framers of which, were anxious to make as comprehensive as possible, and which embraces every information, however discordant, on other questions of policy, the source from which it flowed. The commissioners appointed under that act proceeded to their enquiry; much information has already followed, and at this moment the commission is actually sitting, How therefore will the house receive the allegations of that hon. gent. when on a subject with which it was his duty to be acquainted he is actually uninformed? How, I ask, can the house repose confidence in the loose and undefined charges which he has this night been pleased to make, when of an act of the legislature, passed about a year ago, he is perfectly ignorant of the origin or operation? When the late administration directed their attention to an amelioration of the system of education in Ireland, the first act, of necessity,was to enquire into the state of those funds, which had been intended for that purpose, and which were grossly misapplied. This charge of gross misapplication, I state not either without, sufficient grounds of justification, nor with any in-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0244"/>
<col>457</col>
clictation to avoid the responsibility of my statement. I speak it in the face of the noble lord (Castlereagh) opposite. I charge him with having known and suffered those funds which were intended for the support of a system of national education, to have been grossly and unjustifiably perverted for purposes of personal aggrandisement, and for the furtherance of the most criminal views. [Hear! hear!]. The report of the commissioners proves it; and the evils of the misapplication are lamentably felt in the decline and degradation of those establishments, for whose uses these funds were originally appropriated.&#x2014;Mr. speaker, I can appreciate the nature and temporary stability of that power which can fix its basis upon religious distinction. I can clearly. ascertain the strength of that support which originates with delusion, and is propagated by bigotry; which appeals to all the bad, the base, and malignant feelings of the human heart. In estimating, I say, the nature of political power, so influencing and so operating, I can sufficiently comprehend the transient facilities it possesses over a bold and honest policy, which, in a state where human corruption is so prevalent, manfully wages war with every thing in the shape of public abuse, and sifts the sources of national distress through all the recesses of official peculation and plunder. When funds, appropriated for public charities, were absorbed in private expenditure, when they were calculated on as parts of the family estate, and bequeathed to the descendants us a portion of the patrimonial inheritance, it became high time to meddle with them; and I do not hesitate to declare my strong and decided conviction, that no small part of our political sins arose from our endeavours to correct abuses, to convict delinquents, to restore to the public that money of which it had been shamefully defrauded; and to make even the highest in rank, and most elevated in political connection, return those public funds upon which they had so unjustifiably and illegally drawn.&#x2014;The next charge to which the hon. gent. adverted, was the inattention of the late ministers to the regulation of the tithes in Ireland. I have answered his first accusation from the statute book. I have now to throw myself on the confidence of the house, when I do assure them, that one of the first objects which would have engaged the attention of the late administration, previous to their dismissal, was an amelioration of the tithe system; and I do conjure the present mi-
<col>458</col>
nisters, if they regard the peace and security of Ireland, and the general safety of the empire, to take the state of that system into their immediate consideration and regard. But great and commanding as this necessity is, I can indulge no such expectations from men who have set up the cry of church and state. They, the advocates of the church I some of whom have left nothing undone to degrade the character of religion in its most vital part, by uniting parishes, almost for the length of counties. This, I do assert, was the system of the present lord privy seal, when lord lieutenant of Ireland (the earl of Westmoreland); who, during his government, had raised to the highest station a prelate, who in a moment of alarm had dared to expunge the mitre from the arms on his coach. But this was not all. The broken down in fortune, and the degraded in character, were elevated to the highest dignities in the church, to the exclusion of the religious curate, who had worked for years in the vineyard. [Hear! hear!]. But need we ask a more convincing proof of the disregard of those men for that church, to which they now, with the purest views, feel so zealously attached, than to recollect the changes which they effected in the various parishes in Ireland? I call upon the house to rest its opinion upon experience, and to deduce this plain conclusion from that experience, that whilst they had powers every other principle was sacrificed to personal emolument.&#x2014;I come now, sir, to that measure which his majesty's late ministers had thought expedient to propose for the relief of the Catholics of Ireland. This boon, of which so much has been said, and to which such frequent allusions have been made, did not comprehend but one forty-second part of the restrictions under which that body of subjects labour. At the passing of the union, there were forty-two offices from which Roman Catholics were excluded; and that great measure, I do most seriously assert, was gained under the positive pledge given by the noble lord opposite (Castlereagh), first to the Catholic clergy, and next, through them, to the laity, that every existing disability would be removed, and the whole of those 42 offices would be immediately opened to the Catholic subjects of Ireland. And yet these are the men so pledged and bound by every principle of honour and consistency, who have the effrontery to raise this unfounded clamour of the church in danger, because the late administration had endea-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0245"/>
<col>459</col>
voured to open the army and navy to the Catholic officer! It has been observed, that the noble lord at the head of the last administration was a friend to the great measure;&#x2014;so was I; and my support to it was under the faith of those sacred engagements which I now find the noble lord opposite (Castlereagh) had never even in contemplation the least intention to fulfil. I did hope that the situation of Ireland would be committed to the consideration of the British parliament; that its interests would be impartially consulted, its grievances redressed; that, as it had surrendered itself to the protection of an imperial parliament, its affairs would be considered of imperial importance. Had I not been deluded with those hopes, and deceived by those expectations, I would have sooner suffered my right arm to be cut off, than to have willingly surrendered those rights and advantages, which Ireland, in its independent state, did certainly enjoy. In surrendering that independence, she made a great sacrifice; but it is an unreasonable position to assume, that, because I voted for that measure, therefore am I to submit to the violation of every engagement, to the infraction of every pledge which accompanied it in its progress, and accelerated its execution. To Ireland, I say, it was a great sacrifice; and let this country, for a moment, suppose itself in her place. Let it reflect on what was given up, and on the manner in which that surrender has been recompensed. I unfortunately have seen an indisposition in this house to attend to the concerns of Ireland. Be assured it is a mistaken policy; for it is that component part of the British empire, which will press itself upon British consideration. It is, I say, that component part of the British empire, deprived of whose assistance and support, England would be reduced indeed. At present I will say no more, but revert to those changes which have so lately taken place in the councils of the crown. And here I cannot refrain from expressing my decided conviction, that more than a common secret influence has been exerted to work upon the benignant feelings of a most gracious monarch. Upon those who have used this unconstitutional influence, no common risk of responsibility devolves. But that principle equally extends to the ministry who have succeeded to power, after the demand of the pledge, as it does to the secret advisers of the crown. They entered upon a vacancy created by the refu-
<col>460</col>
sal of their predecessors to give an unconstitutional pledge. And to accept office with such a knowledge, fully commits them to the responsibility of the measures which led to their accession. Will they say, they are not really or virtually bound by that pledge? Will the noble lord opposite (lord Castlereagh) venture to state in his place, that he is now at liberty to fulfil his repeated promises to the Catholics of Ireland? Could the noble duke (the duke of Portland) say, he had not given this, as well as innumerable pledges to the Irish Catholics? What would the house believe, and what mast the country suppose, when they are informed, that that noble duke had actually written two letters to two officers high in rank, of the Irish brigades, wherein he promises this measure for Ireland; and assures them, that it was determined to open the whole of the military career to the Roman Catholics? Thus we see promises made only to be broken; and, when we call upon the government to fulfil its engagements with the people, we are answered with calumny, and assailed with intolerant virulence. But again repeat, that if those pledges had not been most solemnly made, not all the gold of Ireland, nor the gold of England, nor the borough compensation, nor the appointment of compensation commissioners, could have prevailed on the Irish people to have surrendered their domestic legislature. When, therefore, the chancellor of the exchequer sounds the alarm of the church in danger, when he sends forth, amidst the people, apprehensions calculated to excite religious rancour and fanatic fury, his associates should hold his hands, and, for their own consistency, repress him. They are bound to say, "We must resign our situations in a government which is founded on the basis of intolerance; we must abjure a system which goes to create religious dissension, and fixes its power on dividing and inflaming all classes of the people. We will not suffer ourselves to be compromised." This language it is their duty to hold, because, however unable to perform their pledges to the Catholics, they should not forward that system, which ties up their own hands; and which, under the pretext of religion, goes at once to pull down that fabric which protects both church and state.</membercontribution></p>

<col>461</col>
baronet, and his assistance in the prosecution of that object. He never had been a friend to the union with Ireland, and had, at the time the question was first agitated, publicly expressed his disapprobation of the measure. He thought the time was not yet come for so great a work, and that it could not be effected advantageously if it did not settle that very question about winch so much discussion had since arisen. Though the Union was managed by as great a man as ever sat in that house, yet he, with all his talents, was unable to carry the business in the manner necessary, and was compelled to desert the only proper course in which it could have been advantageously effected. Mr. Pitt therefore was obliged to leave the Catholic question unsettled. He regretted the present motion, because it brought this subject so much into discussion, and had forced the sovereign personally so much before the house and the public. He thought it hard that the new ministers should be accused as they had been of bringing the sovereign to the bar of the house, for after the statement of the noble lord (Howick), however respectful and decorous, it was impossible that those who were acquainted with the sentiments and feelings of the party whom the noble lord's statement involved, could abstain from giving, not contradictions of facts, but such views of the transaction as had been taken by that other party. He recollected nothing like such a statement respecting transactions in the king's cabinet having ever been made, and he lamented it should have been given. Much had been said about the pledge demanded; but whether that pledge was unconstitutional or not, was of little consequence, for it could not be denied that the king had the right to dismiss his ministers, and to choose others absolutely. As far as appeared, the demand of a pledge was done without any advice, and though it had been contended that the king could do nothing without advice, he could not concur in that doctrine, for then the constitution would reduce the king to something which never had existed, and never could exist. indeed, if there ever could be a case in which the king might, and must be supposed to act without advice, it was that in which, having differed with one set of ministers, he employed some person to form a new one. He could not see, therefore, on what grounds the new ministers appointed by the king, in such circumstances, could be considered
<col>462</col>
unconstitutionally formed. With respect to the confidence which might be due to ministers, it was a general confidence that would not presume them unworthy of trust before they were tried; and indeed, as to confiding in any ministers, it was rather the duty of the house to watch them than confide in them. He saw no reason, therefore, for the house to stigmatize the new ministers in the first instance, and refuse that confidence which could enable them to discharge the trust their sovereign had conferred on them. For his own part, he was convinced that to yield the Catholic question could do mischief in Ireland; he was sure it could do mischief here; and he was convinced that the Union, instead of accelerating, had retarded the settlement of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Tierney</member> <membercontribution>said, that the hon. gent. who had spoken with so much eloquence and ability (Mr. Milnes), comprised the whole substance of his speech against the motion in one sentence, that it was sufficient for the house to know that the king had dismissed his late ministers. For his part he thought it necessary to know a great deal more. When so extraordinary and unexpected a change had taken place, it was proper for the house to enquire, what were the circumstances that led to it, and what was likely to be the result? The hon. gent. complained, with others, that the king's name was dragged before the house, but he must again repeat, that this was to be attributed solely to the new ministers. There was a time when, in discussing any public measure, members of the house could animadvert upon the king's advisers, but now, for the first time, it was said that the king had no advisers. Who, then, was it that brought the king's name into question, but those who declared that he acted without advice? If such a doctrine as this were to prevail, the character of public men was no longer safe; but when made the victims of intrigue, and their character brought into suspicion, they were not to have the privilege of defending themselves, because the secret advisers of the king shrunk from responsibility, and threw upon the king himself those measures they admitted to be unconstitutional. The interested advisers of the king threw upon the king that which they were afraid to avow; and he took God to witness, that he conscientiously believed that the removal of the late ministers was the result of a long and dark intrigue. The hon. gent. who spoke last had, however, expressed his astonishment
<image src="S1V0009P0I0247"/>
<col>463</col>
that any misunderstanding should have arisen; but when that unfortunate misunderstanding did arise, the late ministers, as they ought, took upon themselves the blame, and fairly acknowledged that the king must be right and themselves wrong. But was it, then, so incomprehensible to the hon. gent., that a misunderstanding should have arisen? Could he have forgotten, that dealing with one of the clearest-headed men that ever existed (Mr. Pitt), and being a person of unquestionable perspicacity, he had been led to commit himself in a very extraordinary manner, respecting a dissolution of parliament in the year 1784, from misunderstanding what really passed between him and Mr. Pitt? Surely, after that, he might conceive a misunderstanding to exist on a complicated question, when he himself had been so much mistaken in a communication upon a very plain and simple point. Then, after the misunderstanding arose, what more could have been done by ministers than withdraw the bill? What measure more conciliatory could have been adopted? Nay, it was made a charge, that the late ministers had withdrawn the bill. But, after the sentiments of the king were distinctly known, it evidently became impossible to prosecute the measure with any prospect of advantage, as it would certainly be unjustifiable for the servants of the crown to carry on any measure as a measure of government, contrary to his wishes. But, it was complained too that they insisted on renewing the subject; whereas they did no more than remind his majesty that circumstances might render it necessary to submit measures connected with the Catholics to his consideration; so that if it had been necessary to do so, they might not be charged with agitating points which it was supposed they had given up. As to the pledge, he was fully satisfied that such an unconstitutional and so unnecessary a demand never could have entered the king's head, if he had not been wrought upon by the most pernicious suggestions of secret advisers. By the pledge the king could gain nothing, for he could dismiss his ministers at any time; but his secret advisers had every thing to gain, by forcing into action this unconstitutional pledge on the ministers they wished to supplant. The secret advisers by this had to gain the exclusion of that association of talents, property, and consideration, which composed the ministry as nothing else
<col>464</col>
but the exclusion of that ministry could enable them to remain in power. The secret advisers, therefore, gained every thing; the king nothing. It was an object, therefore, to shut out by such an artifice, all the talents which composed the late ministry. "All the Talents," he said, was a phrase which gave offence to the other side, but it should be recollected that the right hon. gent. over the way was himself the person who first had employed this very phrase when he used to argue so strenuously some years ago for the formation of a ministry, combining all the talents of the country, in which combination, however, the talents of no one person in the present ministry, except his own, did he (Mr. Canning) propose to include. It was said, however, that the new ministry were to act towards Ireland with a mixture of firmness and conciliation. As to firmness, it was easy to guess what was meant but with regard to conciliation, which supposed mutual giving and receiving, he could not conceive what kind of conciliation that was by which the new ministers pledged themselves to take every thing from the people of Ireland, and give them nothing in return. Besides, was it not absolutely insulting to the people of Ireland, that a noble lord (Castlereagh) was to be a principal member of an administration founded upon avowed hostility to the Catholic claims? That noble lord had written to the Irish Catholics in his own name and in that of Mr. Pitt, telling them to conduct themselves with propriety, and trust to this disposition to promote their cause. Good God! trust to the noble lord! and what had been the consequences? Had not the Irish Catholics for the list six years, conducted themselves with the most unimpeached loyalty? Were they to come to the noble lord and say, "We have fulfilled our engagements; we have followed your counsels; now do you fulfil the engagements you contracted to us." What could the noble lord say, but that "all you say is true; you have been quiet and loyal; you have trusted to me, and in return I have pledged myself never to mention your names?" What sort of conduct was this? and could the gentlemen on the other side deny that they were virtually pledged never to mention to the king any question connected with the Catholics? If they had given no pledge, how stood the matter? Why, that from one set of men a pledge was demanded, and from another not, so that the king had it in his
<image src="S1V0009P0I0248"/>
<col>465</col>
power to apply partially and not generally a test, which must operate to exclude all honourable men from the service of their country. And this system was patronized, too, by one of those (Mr. Canning) who was, beyond all others, vociferous and incessant in calling for administrations that, to use his own phrase, should combine all the talents of the country. The hon. gent. who spoke last, was of opinion that the Catholic question ought to have been settled in Ireland before the Union. That, however, even Mr. Pitt found to be impracticable. The hon. gent. said too that Mr Pitt had, before his last entrance into administration, given satisfaction to the royal mind, that he never would agitate the Catholic question. If this be true, by what means did Mr. Pitt communicate such a satisfaction or pledge? If he did communicate by any member of the administration of that day any thing to that effect, it would confirm a suspicion he then and now entertained, that the administration in question, with which he himself was connected, had fallen the victims of secret intrigues, and that the principal intriguer was the same in both instances. He had for upwards of a month before the fall of that administration, thought that things were not going well, but he was now perfectly satisfied that the same secret advisers had been at work in both cases. With respect to the satisfaction given by Mr. Pitt, he was convinced it must have related to the Catholic question as a whole, for he knew for certain that about a year before Mr. Pitt died, he had it in view to adopt some measure for conciliating the Catholics, and if this was denied, he could show the proofs. It was dear therefore that Mr. Pitt could have given no pledge upon any thing connected with the Catholics. As to the motion before the house, he could not conceive the house of commons so limited and stinted in its functions, that it ought not to presume to ask for any satisfaction respecting the extraordinary and regretted change which had taken place. The king could undoubtedly appoint whom he pleased his ministers, as he could remove them, by his prerogative. But the house of commons had its privileges too; and it ought to express its opinions upon an event so intimately affecting the public welfare. But it was said, to represent the necessity of a permanent and efficient administration, and to express regret at the change, would tend to remove the new and force back the old ministers. As to the first, it was clear, in-
<col>466</col>
deed, that if a permanent and efficient administration was necessary, the new ministers could not remain; it did not follow, however, that the late ministers were to be forced back. It was asked too, would the house stultify the new ministers? That was needless, they had stultified themselves; for on the death of Mr. Pitt they publicly proclaimed their own imbecility, and threw up the government. What had happened since, but that they were thirteen months older, and had placed the duke of Portland at their head? Was the duke of Portland to supply the place of Mr. Pitt, without whom the administration fell of itself? It could not be credited by any one that the duke of Portland, old and infirm as he was, could be the real minister. No one believed it. The performers were all the same, but their parts were to be new cast. Last year Mr. Perceval was attorney-general, now he was to be chancellor of the exchequer. Mr. Canning was as fit to be foreign secretary in 1806 as he was now; and lord Castlereagh quite as ready to be a secretary of state. Lord Mulgrave, indeed, was foreign secretary; now he was thought the fittest man to preside over the navy. The duke of Montrose, from having been president of the board of trade, had been qualified to be master of the horse. The duke of Portland was the only accession, and so strange did such an appointment seem, that no man could believe that it was any thing but temporary; and report gave it to lord Melville or marquis Wellesley. This really seemed probable, for why bring lord Melville into the privy council? But if such an appointment took was confident it would give no satisfaction to the country. As to marquis Wellesley, he certainly was a person of infinite ability; but as certain discussions would come on respecting that noble lord's administration in India, he should not be provoked to say any thing upon the subject at present. Every thing concurred to shew, that some changes must take place, and this formed an additional reason why the house should express their opinion as to the administration which was formed. When he considered indeed, that previous to the late change not so many as seventy members in the house had ever expressed disapprobation of the measures of ministers, he would not believe till he saw it, that the same house which had approved their conduct, would refuse to express regret at their removal. Sorry he was, therefore, to see that the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0249"/>
<col>467</col>
right hon. gent. (Mr. Perceval) had forgot himself so far as to put his name to the assertion, that the church was in danger. It was impossible. Had he believed so, he would not have been so anxious to secure a place for life, in case of removal, knowing that the constitution would fall if the late ministers came into power, and being secure that while in power himself he could retain the duchy of Lancaster if he pleased. As to a dissolution of parliament, he was convinced that it could not be intended, particulaly when he saw a religious clamour raised; because the malice of the devil himself could not have thought of preparing for a dissolution by the false and wicked cry of the church being in danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>said, it would not be necessary for him to argue at great length, after the very able speeches that had been made on the same side. He should be content to put the matter to the decision of the house, upon the single speech of his hon. friend (Mr. Milnes). He utterly denied that his majesty's ministers had been the cause of introducing the king's name and personal character so much into the present debate. The introduction of it in this manner was a novelty, from which he apprehended serious consequences to the constitution. The introduction of it, however, became necessary from the conduct of gentlemen on the other side of the house. The noble lord (Howick) had thought it due to his own character to come down to the house, and make a statement for the vindication of his conduct, which contained several confidential transactions between him and his majesty, that would otherwise not have been known to the house. That noble lord had pledged himself to the house to make that statement, even before he had obtained his majesty's permission for that purpose; but when the permission was obtained, and the statement made, it became necessary that a statement should be made on the other side; and therefore the blame of introducing his majesty's name and personal character into the debate, rested with those who went out of their way to make formal statement to the house, which was by no means called for. Before that statement, his majesty's late ministers, or some of them, gave the minutes of the cabinet to persons who were not of the cabinet nor even of the privy council. This appeared to him a high crime and misdemeanour. The present ministers were therefore obliged to apply the antidote to the bane. As
<col>468</col>
to secret advisers, his majesty had expressly told his late ministers, that he had never communicated with any body on this subject except with his secretary, to whom he dictated the communications that were sent in his name. He did not know any practical good that could follow from the motion, and he thought it hardly fair and manly for the right hon. gent. (Mr. Tierney) to talk of dismissing the present ministers without wishing that the late ministers should come in, in their places. He should ask what third party did then exist, out of which his majesty could have formed an unexceptionable administration? It was not surprising, that when his majesty, in the exercise of his royal prerogative, thought proper to dismiss one party, he should choose his ministers from the other. He thought his majesty's late ministers were not justified in bringing forward the measure against the determined and conscientious scruples of his majesty; but when they had brought it forward, he could not conceive upon what principle they should have abandoned it, unless on the principle of throwing all the odium of the measure upon the king. His majesty must have seen that the giving it up was a mere concession of temporary convenience; but that the greater part of his then ministers were determined to support the Catholic claims when they should be brought forward, if not to agitate the question themselves. His majesty had therefore a right, after informing them that his mind was unalterably made up upon this point, to demand an assurance from them that they would not harass or disturb him any more upon the subject. Was it possible that he could have confidence in his late ministers ceasing to harass him upon this subject, when he was expressly informed that many of them would vote in favour of the Catholic petition whenever it should be brought forward. If his majesty had not dismissed his ministers upon their refusing to give such assurance, the crown would have been subservient to a party in that house. It must be also considered, that although his majesty retained all the energy of his mind, and the decision of his character, yet he was now advanced in years, and subject to infirmity. It was a very serious thing for him at present to be obliged to quarrel with his government and dismiss his ministers. If he were still to live ten or twelve years longer, it would be a most melancholy consideration to think that he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0250"/>
<col>469</col>
was to be perpetually exposed to such a painful circumstance, when it was well known that his mind was irrevocably made up on the subject, not from political considerations, but from a paramount religious feeling. In the conduct of the late ministers, which led to their dismissal, he saw nothing of "All the Talents" which they were said to unite. Their dispatch was not only misunderstood by his majesty, but by some of their colleagues, and by their friends in Ireland. They had also omitted to summon three members of the cabinet, who differed from them, to the council. The withholding the summonses in this instance appeared to him a crime, which almost deserved impeachment. Lord Erskine, who was one of the ministers who were not summoned, was, from his office, the highest servant of the crown, and in a peculiar manner, the keeper of his majesty's conscience, and yet he was never summoned upon the occasion. He believed that the late ministers had now discovered that their conduct was rash and ill considered. It was not only his majesty that had dismissed them, but they were no longer supported by the majority of that house. The other house had also, in the fullest attendance of peers that was ever known, decided against them by a very great majority, and the general feeling out of doors was also in favour of his majesty and against the conduct of his late ministers. The parliament as well as the nation had determined to stand by the crown, and there was a general feeling of attachment to the person of the Sovereign that would not allow the latter years of his long and glorious reign to be clouded and rendered unhappy by the perpetual agitation of a question most distressing to his private feelings. He would not allow, that the dismissal of ministers would be a fatal blow to Ireland. The Catholic bill had been brought in upon a statement which was directly contrary to the information which ministers had received from the duke of Bedford, as that nobleman had expressly informed them that the disturbances in the West of Ireland were not at all occasioned by any religious question. As to his own opinion upon the Catholic claims, he had always been against giving political power to the Catholics until the Union. Before that period, he conceived that letting the mass of the population of Ireland into the constitution, would be subversive of the principles upon which it was founded. He
<col>470</col>
considered, however, that that danger would in a great measure be done away by the Union, and he stated this opinion in the Irish parliament, and he stated it not only as his opinion, but as that of many of the leading members of the English government with whom he was connected; but in stating this opinion, he never did give any thing like a direct pledge to the Catholics. Although Mr. Pitt retired from office upon the Catholic question, yet when he found how deeply rooted his majesty's objections were, he never thought of agitating the question again, and declared expressly to his friends, that should the question again come on, since he found that it was so distressing to his majesty, he should not support it, but protect him against it. This resolution was communicated to his majesty some time before he again called him to his councils. For his part, he considered it his chief duty to consult the ease and comfort of his majesty in his administration of the affairs of the empire. His lordship then passed in review the whole conduct of the late ministers. From their first entrance into power, he thought they had been overbearing, and had disgusted all the principal bodies in the kingdom. They first endeavoured to force the East-India company to accept a governor-general of their appointment. They dispirited the volunteers, by speaking contemptuously of them; they disgusted the shipping interest, and lastly, they attempted to force the conscience of the king to their measures; but when they found that was not to be done, they were content to put their Catholic bill in their pockets, and to keep their places. There never was exhibited in this country, a government of such complete imbecility. They had claimed all the talents in the country, and yet had shewn no vestige of talents. They had excluded all the friends of Mr. Pitt from an administration that was to contain "All the Talents in the country." They should have recollected, however, that at the death of Mr. Fox, they lost that superiority of talents which they might have boasted of during his life time. As to the present ministers, they came in without any intrigue or solicitation on their part, and if they had refused to enter into the service of his majesty, he did not exactly see where this third party were to come from, who were to form a new administration. If it was improper then to accept of offices under these circumstances, it would follow that the crow
<image src="S1V0009P0I0251"/>
<col>471</col>
was to be completely subservient to and dependent on a party in that house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <member>denied that the late ministers had been deserving of the numerous charges which the noble lord had brought against them. The first person appointed by them to go out to India, as governor-general, was the earl of Lauderdale, a nobleman in every respect highly qualified to fill that high and important station, but against whom an opposition was raised, perhaps by the influence of the noble lord himself, and others who still retained an influence; and so far from forcing the directors, that appointment was given up, and a nobleman, who had since gone out, had been appointed, against whom no opposition had been made. He complained of the unconstitutional use made of the king's name, and insisted that nothing had been said by the late ministers that required the introduction of it; for they had admitted there had been a misunderstanding, and it had been consented to, that that misunderstanding was imputable to them; there was, therefore, no reason for using the king's name. Then came the pledge, which was proposed and refused. He had stated over and over again, that such pledge was unconstitutional, and the arguments had been admitted by the whole house. What was this pledge? Why, that his majesty's confidential servants should undertake in writing not only to abstain from bringing forward the Catholic question, but that they should not mention any thing connected with it. The present ministers, who are the legal advisers of the king, say they did not advise this measure, but that it was the king's own act, than which declaration nothing could be more unconstitutional, for they by that threw the whole upon the king, and they only are therefore to be blamed for introducing his sacred name into the present and late debate. If it were allowed that one act might take place without advisers, others might do the same; and in such case all responsibility would be at an end, and his majesty would be as arbitrary as any monarch in Europe. The noble lord had by his letter, written under the sanction of Mr. Pitt, assured the Catholics, that if they would be patient, their case should be duly attended to, and every possible means used that it might ultimately be crowned with success; for that he and Mr. Pitt would do every thing in their power to recommend it to the public.&#x2014;The noble lord had also attacked the late ministers for having
<col>472</col>
abandoned the bill. He had so often answered this, that he should be ashamed so far to trespass on the attention of the house, as to do it again. An hon. gent. (Mr. Gore) had asked, what the duke of Bedford had done? He would tell him and the house, that the duke had acted with firmness and mercy; he had quelled disturbances in Ireland, without infringing on the constitution, or trampling under foot the liberties of the people. If there ever was a time of peculiar peril and danger, which required a firm and vigorous administration in this country, he believed it was the present. Was the present such an administration? He thought not. He was not a little alarmed, when he saw the spirit with which they commenced their administration, by endeavouring to excite religious animosities and to set up the cry that the church was in danger. He thought the house could not place confidence in such an administration, and therefore he should support the motion. He acknowledged his majesty had a right, by his prerogative, to choose his own servants, but insisted that the house had the privilege of giving its opinion on the fitness of such servants to fill the situations to which they were appointed. He should not become a vexatious opponent to their measures, but would do his duty as a member of parliament, and narrowly watch their measures, in which he had no doubt but he should be warmly assisted by a very large portion of the house.</member></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>opposed the motion, expressing at the same time his regret, that the late ministers should have been removed, and his entire, approbation of every part of their conduct, with the exception of that only which led to their removal: disapproving of that part, he could not consistently support a motion which implied an unqualified approval of all their measures. But he had another and a stronger objection to this motion, and that was, as he had stated on a former evening, in discussing a proposition of a similar character, that it would serve to put a negative upon the exercise of his majesty's undoubted prerogative, in choosing his own ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Percy rose</member> <membercontribution>to express his approbation of the original motion. The measures brought forward by his majesty's late ministers, he could not but in general approve of. The act for the abolition of the slave trade, which had so lately passed, and the appointment of a committee for the reduction of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0252"/>
<col>473</col>
sinecure places and fees, were measures which would ever reflect upon them the highest honour, and be attended with the greatest advantage to the country. He could not however avoid lamenting, that they should have introduced a bill into the house, for giving an extension of power to the Roman Catholics; no man, he trusted, was a greater friend to toleration than himself, yet he could not help disapproving of any measure which would enable Roman Catholics in this kingdom to hold the appointments of commander-in-chief, and master-general of the ordnance, as it had been usual for persons holding those situations, to have a seat in the cabinet, and the concession of such offices certainly went to a great extension of power, but did not contribute to the free exercise of religion; but from what had lately dropped in this house, he understood the measure had been abandoned.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Perceval)</member> <membercontribution>combated the notion, that the removal of the late ministers was the effect on a long and dark intrigue. If so, he contended that the evil spirit which conducted it, must have found its way into the minds on lord Grenville and his noble colleague on the other side, and have urged them to press forward the bill which was the immediate and obvious cause of their removal. The right hon. gent. also resisted the doctrine maintained by the supporters of the motion as to the idea that those ministers who accepted office were legally responsible for the change which led to the vacancies they occupied. He put the case of ministers being dismissed even from caprice, and asked whether other men were to refuse to succeed them, and the government was to stop merely under the notion of this responsibility? As to the notice taken of his address to his constituents, he begged it to be understood, that he did not by any means mean it as an election squib, as had been stated; for the sentiments which it contained were those which he really held. But so far from those sentiments serving to raise any dangerous outcry, he maintained that the danger was created by the proceedings of the gentlemen on the other side, and that the course which he took of resisting them was the best means of averting that danger. This, he thought, should appear to the gentlemen themselves, from the spirit which manifested itself throughout the country; a spirit, indeed, which could not be excited by any thing in the
<col>474</col>
power of an humble individual like himself to offer, and which must convince gentlemen on the other side that they had been quite mistaken as to the popular feeling: for if they had been allowed to go much further, those gentlemen must now see that they would have created considerable agitation and alarm throughout the kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>entered his protest against the doctrines which the house had heard from the other side, upon the question of responsibility. If, indeed, these doctrines were to obtain; if it were allowed that the king could exercise his prerogative without an adviser in one case, so he might in another. His majesty might make his <i>veto</i> against an act or both houses of the legislature, and, if he could do so without a responsible adviser, then, instead of a balance of power in the constitution, all the power would be in the king; for, combining the maxim, that "the king can do no wrong," with the doctrine now attempted to be established, that the king can act without any responsible adviser, there would be an end of that controul of the executive authority which the constitution intended; because the king could not be personally arraigned, and because any act of the executive power, shielded by the pretence set up in this instance, that such act proceeded from the individual will of the king, could not be made the subject of accusation. But he deprecated such doctrines, as subversive of the first principles of the constitution, and ridiculed the idea of setting up the old and exploded notions with regard to any invasion of the prerogative arising out of the expression of the sentiment of that house, upon any exercise whatever of that prerogative.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Master of the Rolls</member> <membercontribution>was for the motion for passing to the order of the day. Many ministers had been dismissed from office without any cause assigned, but never until now had a minister come down to parliament to complain of his sovereign. Lord Somers was removed without the shadow of complaint. Did he come down to parliament to institute an investigation of the cause? When the celebrated Whig administration were removed by queen Anne, did they breathe a whisper against their royal mistress in either house of parliament? If a minister were to secure to himself the right of enquiring into the cause of his removal, he would approximate his situation to that of a judge, or any other
<image src="S1V0009P0I0253"/>
<col>475</col>
officer for life. In 1757, the dismissal of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge produced a great ferment; but was any thing said in parliament about that dismissal? Of a change in administration, parliament had no constitutional knowledge, and on such change could found no enquiry. He thought the permission given to a noble lord to detail the transactions which had led to the dismission, unconstitutional, as it was publishing the proceedings of the privy council, which ought to be kept sacredly secret. The question therefore, in his opinion, ought never to have been agitated in the house of commons.<lb/>

<p><member>[CAPTURE OF MONTE VIDEO.] Lord Hawkesbury rose</member>, <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, to move the Thanks of the house to brigadier-general sir S. Auchmuty, for the capture of Monte Video. On some former occasions, he said, doubts had been entertained by the house, whether the thanks of the house ought to be given in cases where important captures were made with little or no resistance on the part of the enemy. In the present case, however, in whatever point of view the achievement was considered, there could be no possible doubt, in his opinion, that it ought to be rewarded with the thanks of the house. The thanks of that house constituted an highly valuable and greatly valued reward, which encouraged the living and afforded the greatest consolation to the relations of those who fell. The brave exertions of the British troops, and the skill and valour of the officers, displayed in the capture of Monte Video, eminently deserved, in his opinion, that reward. The particulars of this capture had already been published. It appeared from this account, that two actions had been fought, in which the British troops had been victorious, and that subsequently Monte Video was carried by assault, after encountering and overcoming the greatest difficulties, with a spirit and a bravery deserving of the highest praise. This gallant achievement was of the greatest impor-
<col>476</col>
tance, not only from the impression which the bravery of our troops must make upon the enemy in that quarter of the globe, but also from the impression which must be made upon the people of the country, by the moderation and forbearance, the good order and discipline displayed by our troops, after the conquest was completed, and this, too, under circumstances which (if any circumstances could justify it) would have justified a contrary conduct, namely, the carrying the place by assault. His lordship concluded by moving the thanks of the house to brigadier-general sir S. Auchmuty, to brigadier-general the hon. W. Lumley, and the other officers under the command of sir Samuel, and an acknowledgement of the services of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Galloway</member> <membercontribution>thought it necessary to call the attention of the house to one or two points connected with this subject. The brave achievement which the thanks of the house were called for, deserved, in his opinion, the highest praise, and he rejoiced to hear the noble secretary of state come forward in the way he had, to move for those thanks.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Mulgrave </member>, <membercontribution>after a warm panegyric<ob/> on the spirited exertions of our navy in cooperating with the army on the present occasion, concluded with similar motions to rear-admiral Stirling, the officers, men, &amp;c., under his command.&#x2014;The question was then put upon these motions, and they were all carried, <i>nem. diss.</i></membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-04-16">Thursday, April 16.</date>
<p><member>[CAPTURE OF MONTE VIDEO.] Lord Castlereagh rose</member> <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, to call the attention of the house to the brilliant and important services rendered by his majesty's forces in the Capture of Monte Video. It was impossible that a person in his situation could feel any duty more agreeable, than doing this justice to the services performed by his majesty's forces. Nothing could be more grateful to the feelings of a person so situated, than to find, that in all the variety of opinions that prevailed on all other subjects, party feeling was entirely laid asleep on subjects of this kind, and only one spirit of emulation who should be most prompt to pay the tribute of gratitude and applause, prevailed in every bosom. He was sure he could say of one individual on the opposite side (Mr. Windham), that whatever difference of opinion
<image src="S1V0009P0I0254"/>
<col>477</col>
he might have with his majesty's present ministers on the management of the army, he would, on an occasion like the present, bury all those differences in oblivion, and be among the foremost to unite with those on that side of the house in acknowledging and applauding the service that had been done. He could assure that right hon. gent., that no difference of opinion that existed on other points could make it less grateful to him (lord C.) to acknowledge and do justice to the merits of persons called into action by his recommendation than if those .persons had been appointed by himself. He was sure that only one sentiment prevailed as to the merit of the service rendered, whether the importance of the acquisition was considered, or the nature of the execution. Though the force engaged was of a limited number, yet this was one of those military efforts which entitled those who had performed it, to the best thanks of the country. In respect to the amount of military excellence, no enterprise could be better selected than this in particular to mark with the most distinguished approbation. In the sort of attack that it had been necessary to make, the highest qualities of soldiers, the steadiest discipline, and the most undaunted firmness and bravery were conspicuously displayed. The assault was made under every disadvantage, and it was only by their eminent superiority in these great qualities that the British troops had been able to overcome all the obstacles opposed to them, and render themselves masters of the place. The breach had been in itself less practicable than was supposed, and had been rendered by the enemy, in the course of the night preceding the assault, so extremely inaccessible, that when the troops, which had been wisely sent forward before break of day, approached, they found it scarcely discernible: their discipline and firmness were put to the most trying test, by their being obliged to remain a long time exposed to the fire of the enemy's guns, before they could ascertain the breach, or attempt to enter it. The house would feel, that in expressing its thanks on the present occasion, it was discharging a debt of gratitude. The discharge of that debt would at the same time have the effect of giving additional spirit and enterprise to the army and the navy, to emulate the exploits that were so honourably distinguished. He should not trespass further on the house in a case where every feeling was already prompt to
<col>478</col>
answer the call that was made, but he could not suppress an expression of regret for the officers who had fallen in this glorious enterprise, and whose loss must cast a gloom over the joy the achievement inspired. The country had suffered a severe loss in the distinguished and gallant officers who had fallen. But it was the misfortune of war, that no important services could be rendered without similar losses; and the glorious nature of the achievement, and the Importance of the service rendered in this case, must be to the friends of those with whose blood it was purchased, as well as to the country, to whom the loss of such men was no less deplorable, a consolation under affliction which would otherwise be inconsolable, He concluded with moving, "That the thanks of the house be given to brigadier-general sir S. Auchmuty, for the skill and gallantry displayed by him in taking the important fortress of Monte Video."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Doyle and Mr. Windham rose</member> <member>together. Sir John Doyle having given way,</member></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>said, that after the forcible manner in which the noble lord had conveyed the general feeling, he felt it rather a trespass on the house to offer any thing further. He could not pretend to any share in the glory of the brilliant achievement now under the consideration of the house, merely for his being in the office of secretary of state for the war department when the expedition was fitted out. But having turned his mind particularly to the outset and the operations of this expedition, he felt a natural disposition to say a few words on the occasion. He was sure the noble lord Opposite did not feel less warmly upon the success of the expedition than if he had himself fitted it out. The noble lord would do him the justice to say, that he had felt no less warmly when it had fallen to him to discharge a debt of the same kind on succeeding the noble lord in moving the vote of thanks for the victory of Maida. He agreed with the noble lord in his observations on all the details of the achievement now under consideration. In every one of those details there was a particular claim to the gratitude of the country. The achievement, considered altogether; was one of the highest in the highest class of military services. The circumstances that attended it, called for particular notice. The fortress was strong beyond what had been calculated. It was impossible
<image src="S1V0009P0I0255"/>
<col>479</col>
men could be placed in a more trying situation, attacking an almost undiscoverable breach, on which an immense quantity of fire had been brought to bear. These circumstances were of such a nature as to require all the high qualities of the troops which were the subject of the present panegyric. Thus, whether it was considered with respect to the value of the conquest, or the nature of the action by which it was gained, this glorious performance could not be too highly estimated. It was necessary, besides, to observe, that the loss that had been sustained, heavy as it was, had fallen chiefly, not on the whole army, but on that part which was engaged in the storm. It was a loss on 1200 men, not on 4000, and in proportion as the loss was greater, so was the glory. It was a consolation, though a mournful one, to those whose relations had fallen, that their lives were not thrown away, but that they had been the means of adding greatly to the national glory, and of promoting the most important interests of their country. The merit of our soldiers was greatly enhanced by the gallant defence made by their opponents, stimulated as they were by the influence of their priests, to the most fanatical enthusiasm. At the same time that this powerful resistance enhanced the glory of the conquest, another important effect also would, he trusted, result from it, that the valour displayed by the Spanish troops would inspire their countrymen in Europe with a kindred spirit in resisting the common enemy; an enemy who, although approaching them under the mask of friendship, was more dangerous than we were in open hostility. If a little of this spirit was displayed in Old Spain, it would be attended with consequences at which Europe would have reason to rejoice. He would say no more. What had been achieved, was beyond the power of him, or any body, to increase by words.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Doyle</member> <membercontribution>said, if he had been pertinacious in offering himself to the house at the same time with the right hon. gent., he hoped it would be a sufficient excuse to state, first, that he did not see the right hon. gent., and secondly, he hoped he should be forgiven if he shewed a little tenacity in pressing his claim to the attention of the house, when he mentioned that one of the regiments particularly engaged on this glorious occasion (the 87th), he had himsel<ob/> the honour of raising. On this account, he naturally wished to raise his voice in paying the common tribute of ap-
<col>480</col>
plause to the glorious deeds now under consideration. He was unwilling that his brave companions in arms, who had followed his fortunes in the last war, should have reason to complain of him for having sat silent when their glory was the theme of admiration, and when he, who was acquainted with their spirit and character from their outset, ought to be the first to bear testimony to their merit. In every situation in which his majesty's army could be employed, he was satisfied it would display the same heroism, and he hoped would obtain similar advantages for the country. He spoke from experience; for he had never known an instance in which British troops had been engaged with equal or nearly equal numbers, in which their conduct had not been such as to redound to the honour and advantage .of their country. What the noble lord and the right hon. gent. had said, rendered it unnecessary fur him to say more. The strength of the place, the difficulty of the breach, the quantity of ordnance brought to bear on it, and the great disparity of numbers, rendered this action as brilliant as any former one; and there was no instance of an exploit exceeding it. He should content himself with giving his support to the motion, introduced in a manner so honourable to the parties who had moved and seconded it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. M. Matthew</member> <membercontribution>commended the hon. general, for the particular notice he had taken of the 87th regiment. It was true, that regiment, led on by a gallant friend of his, had distinguished itself particularly in the assault. But what the hon. general might have added, and what he was sorry he had omitted, was, that that regiment to a man was composed of Roman Catholics. It was also a fact that 3 of the 4 thousand men composing the expedition, were Catholics. Who after this could say that Catholics were not to be trusted with arms? Whoever would say so, was ungrateful, and the worst enemy of the country.&#x2014;The thanks were then voted to brigadier-general Lumley, and to the officers and men; and also to admiral Stirling, for his distinguished skill and ability in effecting the landing; to the captains and officers of the fleet for their co-operation, and to the seamen and marines. It was ordered that the votes should be communicated by the Speaker to sir S. Auchmuty and Admiral Stirling.&#x2014;After a few words from sir T. Turton and others, the votes were severally agreed to <i>nem. con.</i></membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-04-17">Friday, April 17.</date>
<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.]&#x2014;Lord Kinnaird rose</member> <member>to acquaint their lordships, that it was his intention to move that the lord president and the two senior judges of the court of session be ordered to attend.</member></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Montrose</member> <membercontribution>moved, as an amendment, that the following words be added, "and be admitted within the body of this house."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>wished the noble lords to recollect, that the order of the house which commanded the attendance of the lord president and the senior judges, also extended to such other judges as were able to attend. It so happened, that there were some other judges of that court in town, and therefore be thought it necessary that the present motion should embrace that part of the case.&#x2014;The motion so amended was put and carried; and the chairman was ordered to report the proceedings to the house forthwith. The house having resumed, lord Walsingham reported the decision of the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Montrose</member> <membercontribution>argued in favour of the right of the Scotch judges to be admitted within the body of the house. At all times it was a great and wise measure of policy, to hold in reverence and estimation, those learned persons to whom was entrusted the dispensation of the laws. But the judges of Scotland had a claim from the usages and customs of the Scottish parliament; as, previous to the union, they, on all occasions, were entitled to take their seats in that assembly. Under such circumstances, he conceived that the judges of the court of session, independent of all personal feelings, were right in supporting what they supposed the privilege of their body; and, with that conviction, he was induced to submit the motion he made in the committee, "that they be admitted within the body of the house."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>trusted the house would believe, that there was not amongst their lordships an individual who entertained for the judicial character a higher reverence than he did; but, at the same time, he felt convinced, that no legal right existed by which the judges, either of Ireland or Scotland, were entitled to seats within the body of the house. At the period when a learned judge (Fox) from Ireland was placed below the bar of the house, he was seriously grieved; but he still must contend, that the deci-
<col>482</col>
sion of the committee appointed to inquire into the precedents, was perfectly correct. At all events, he had thought it his duty, in order to support the characteristic dignity, and the necessary reverence of the judicial character, to consider of a legislative act on that subject; and he would now assure the house, with its indulgence, that he intended to ask for leave to bring in a bill accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Auckland</member> <membercontribution>was of opinion, that as it was the general sense of the house, that the judges of Ireland and Scotland had no legal right to the privilege, he could not see the necessity of any legislative interference. He was inclined to consider such interference rather as an innovation of a most dangerous tendency.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>contended, that the noble baron did not put the suggestion of his noble and learned friend, in a fair point of view. If the judges of Scotland had now no right, surely it was not an improper measure, which would impart to the judicial character, both in Ireland and Scotland, that privilege. There was one great difference, at least it had so struck him, in a comparison between the right of the Scotch and Irish judges. The Irish judges were called to parliament by the summons of the king; and, of course, when that summons ceased, their right to a seat within the body of the house was annulled. But the judges of Scotland sat in the Scottish parliament, by immemorial usage; and the motion of his noble friend went to allow them that which they had enjoyed in their national legislature. He only stated these facts for the consideration of the house, and not with any view of giving a decisive opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>expressed his willingness to support the bill to which the noble lord alluded, and which went to grant to the judges of Scotland and Ireland, the right of sitting within the body of the house. At the same time, he must insist, that the precedent in the case of Judge Fox was conclusive against the present claim of the judges of the court of session in Scotland. He felt the force of the objection, even to the intended bill, inasmuch as it went to make an appearance at the bar of the house, a matter of degradation, and a subject of reproach. It was to be recollected, that some of the most respected characters in the history of the country, were often examined at that bar; and, therefore, he could not see that the cause of jealousy, in the Scotch judges, was at all warranted. That learned body stated a va-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0257"/>
<col>483</col>
riety of reasons, which they conceived supported the pretensions they had made. But with all respect for that learned and respectable body, he could not give them much credit for the cogency of their arguments, the strength of their precedents, or the ingenuity of their inferences. Their reasonings convinced him of the liability of learned men to assume a right, which might probably have existed in distant periods of history, but which was solemnly abrogated in modern times. Thus, it was not long since a learned person from Scotland (the lord advocate Hope), was heard defending himself from a charge in the house of commons, by contending, that the whole power of the privy council of Scotland was vested in his official character; although one of the acts which followed closest on the heels of the union, was to deprive that office of such extraordinary and unlimited powers. The arguments of the court of session, on this point, shewed such an ignorance of the occurrences of modern periods, as applying to their case, that it was fair to assume, a <i>fortiori</i>, that the facts of more remote times were not either well understood, or correctly stated. With respect to the opinion, that the attendance of the judges of the court of session, on appeals in the house, was a desirable circumstance, it was not his wish to throw any censure on the learned persons entrusted with the jurisprudence of Scotland; but he could not help remarking, that he had heard within the walls of the house sufficient to induce him to deprecate such an inclination. Indeed, he thought the Opinion of Mr. Boswell quite convincing; who, when told on an appeal cause, in which he was engaged, that the court of session was unanimous in passing the decree, pointedly replied, "that when that court were divided in opinion, they deliberated but little; but when it happened that they were unanimous, they deliberated not at all." With respect to the ingenious remark, that the precedents which denied the Scotch judges the right, referred only to the lords justiciary, and not to the court of session, he should only answer, that as the lord chief justice clerk was also a member of the court of session, he could not admit the position, that if he was in either character entitled to the right, he ought to be denied, because he might be summoned to attend with respect to the duties of another office. The noble lord concluded with expressing his determination to oppose the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville</member> <membercontribution>deprecated the elaborate at-
<col>484</col>
tack made by the noble lord on the respectable, learned, and loyal body, which composed the court of session. He considered it a churlish principle, in any great kingdom, to deal illiberally with those of other countries, which, in their union, had given up much of national pride and independent magnificence. The services of the learned persons who were in attendance on the service of the house, he had occasion to know, when he held the important office of secretary for the home department, at a period when that part of the country was endangered by revolutionary cabals, and treasonable conspiracies. He wished the judges of every part of the kingdom to be treated with every reverence and respect, because it tended to promote that love of justice, which was the strongest fortress of the subordination of society.&#x2014;The motion for admitting the Scotch judges within the body of the house was then put and negatived.&#x2014;The house having resolved itself into a committee,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>thought it would be the most convenient mode for him to communicate to the committee his ideas upon the subject, previous to moving any particular amendment, the different parts of the bill being intimately connected, and the amendments which he should move being those which arose out of his general view of the measure He admitted that a great evil existed in the number of appeals to that house from Scotland, and that a remedy ought to be applied, but he disliked going further than the remedying that evil required. He approved of the division of the court of session, but thought that instead of three chambers it would be much preferable to have only two chambers, consisting of eight judges and seven; the lord president being in one chamber, and the lord justice clerk in the other. There was another principle also highly important, with a view to diminish the number of appeals to that house, and which had not been touched upon in this bill, namely, to give power to the chambers to award possession to the party in whose favour the decision had turned. This, he was convinced, would prevent a great number of appeals to that house, many of which, it was well known, were only made up for the purpose of delay. With respect to the proposed court of review, it was the opinion of many persons well informed on the subject, that it would only be an additional stage in the progress of litigation, and would not prevent any appeals to that house. To the court of review, as pro-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0258"/>
<col>485</col>
posed in the bill, he Was decidedly hostile, and he could conceive no other object in View in its establishment than the creation of a new and important office in the person of the president of that court He could not, however, consent to the establishment of, a court in Scotland superior to the court of session, such being, in his opinion, a violation of the act of union; if such a court should be deemed advisable, he thought it ought to be formed out of the court of session itself. With respect to the proposed introduction of trial by jury in civil cases in Scotland, he was friendly to the experiment, but it was a measure which he thought ought to be proceeded in with great caution and deliberation. He disliked in theory the Compelling juries to be unanimous, although long experience in this country had sanctioned the principle, but he thought it somewhat extraordinary, that whilst juries in criminal cases in Scotland decided by a majority, that it should be proposed to compel them to an unanimous decision in civil cases. His lordship concluded, by moving an amendment in the first clause of the bill, to the effect of dividing the court of session into two chambers instead of three.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>contended, that it was incumbent upon the noble lord to give some reason for his proposed division of the court of session into two instead of three chambers; at present he had given none, except that it was his opinion. Experience in this country was in favour of three courts, with a few judges in each, and all theory on the subject pointed out the expediency of having the smaller in preference to the greater number of judges. He had, when he first proposed this measure, not thought it advise-able that the number of the judges of the Court of session should be reduced, but if the proposition for two chambers was persisted in, he should then contend that the number of judges ought to be reduced, inasmuch as five judges would be amply sufficient for each chamber. The noble lord had somewhat unfairly charged the late ministers with having only in view the creation of a new office in the establishment of the court of review; but if the division into two chambers was to be persisted in, and the number of judges not reduced, the truth would be, that noble lords on the other side were continuing five useless and unnecessary offices. With respect to the proposed court of review, when that subject came fairly under discussion, he would undertake to prove to their lordships, that it
<col>486</col>
was not a violation of the act of union, and that without such a court, very little would be done towards effecting the great object in view, that of diminishing the great number of appeals to that house. As to what had been said by the noble lord respecting the chambers giving possession to the parties in whose favour they had decided, it was noticed in the resolutions of last session, but he had seen no proposition upon that subject which was not liable to many objections. He objected strongly to giving an arbitrary discretion to courts upon this point. He had heard the noble lord with great surprise upon the subject of juries, and he was utterly astonished that an Englishman should, in an English house of parliament, declaim against trial by jury.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, said that he had not argued against the establishment of juries, but as to the principle of unanimity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>resumed, and again expressed his astonishment that the noble lord should object to that which the experience of ages had sanctioned in this country, and proved to be highly beneficial. He was not surprised, however, that to the minds to whose consideration this measure now devolved, and with the advice now likely to be taken upon the subject, that the difficulties in the way of the establishment of trial by jury, in civil cases in Scotland, should appear so insuperable. He thought a most extraordinary principle had been advanced by the noble lord, as the foundation of his opinions upon this subject; for it amounted to this, that in remedying a great evil we should not look to any enlarged theory, but should do as little as possible. He contended that it still remained for the noble lord to state his reasons for the alteration he proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>coincided in opinion with his noble friend, as to the division of the court of session into two chambers, because he did conceive it would fully answer the object required. With respect to the number of Scotch appeals presented to that house, he conceived the best remedy to consist in affixing large costs to those which were presented on improper and untenable grounds. The house was aware that until such a remedy was adopted, it would be impossible to check an evil which was supported by the parties who, brought forward those appeals, as well by the profit arising from the interest of money, as the benefit of possession. He fully coincided in the opinion with the late lord Mansfield, that it
<image src="S1V0009P0I0259"/>
<col>487</col>
was impossible to introduce the trial by jury into Scotland, generally.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <member>replied, that he saw nothing in the noble and learned lord's observations, but an opinion without any solid argument.</member></p>
<p><member>Lord Erskine</member> <membercontribution>supported, the principle of the bill in all its branches, and thought it exceedingly strange, that the introduction of trial by jury, generally, into Scotland, should be matter of such extreme apprehension and caution, particularly as it was already partially known and valued in that country, as the source of all the blessings of liberty enjoyed in this. He observed an illustrious personage, on the other side of the house (the duke of Cumberland) smile, and he must be bold to tell him such a smile was inconsistent with the decorum with which that house was in the habit of hearing every noble lord express his sentiments; but it was particularly indecorous and indecent in that illustrious personage to smile at a panegyric upon the trial by jury. Trial by Jury was the means of placing the present family upon the throne of England, and trial by jury had preserved our most gracious sovereign, that illustrious person's father, throughout his long and glorious reign. Trial by jury was the best security for the freedom of that house; and he should never cease to feel and know, that Trial by Jury enabled him to address their lordships upon equal terms with the highest man among them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Redesdale</member> <membercontribution>coincided in opinion with his noble and learned friend (lord Eldon) that the bill in its present state would be a violation of the act of union, and totally unnecessary; but if such a measure should be found necessary, he thought it first ought to undergo the investigation of a commission of inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>expressed a hope that the noble and learned lord who spoke last, and who had acknowledged that he had been often induced to change his opinion, upon various subjects, had now from conviction, changed that prejudice and opinion, he had some time since entertained, with respect to one-fourth of his majesty's subjects, he meant the Roman catholics. An opinion and prejudice most disgraceful to this country, in the eyes of every enlightened nation on the globe.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville</member> <membercontribution>entered at large into the nature and object of the proposed change. He did-not see the benefits which the noble baron was so sanguine as to expect from the measure. It was, in his mind, an innova-
<col>488</col>
tion on that system of jurisprudence, which the Scotch nation, at the period of the revolution, were so anxious to preserve and perpetuate. But he acquiesced in the proposition of the noble baron (lord Hawkesbury) with respect to making it a measure of temporary experiment, until a commission was appointed for the purpose of fully ascertaining the general grounds of the measure, and the general feeling of the nation to whom it peculiarly related,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Kinnaird</member> <membercontribution>could not contemplate, without surprise, the conduct of noble lords relative to this measure. They had taken advantage of the late ministerial. changes, totally to new-model the object and detail of the system so ably proposed by his noble friend, and so long desired by Scotland. Such conduct went to mock the expectations of the people of Scotland, and to cheat them of their hopes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale rose</member> <membercontribution>to oppose the intention of the noble lords, in trying to take an advantage of the house, and in proposing to a committee, in the form of an amendment, a measure altogether new in its principles. Such conduct was a violation of the privileges, and a complete disregard of the opinion of the people; that opinion which his noble friend, who first introduced the measure, had used every means fully to acquire and understand. The noble viscount (Melville) had talked of innovations Every remedy for an existing evil, was throughout the whole period of his administration for that country, considered by him as an innovation. But was it a measure to promote a system of jobbing and of favouritism, it would have fully accorded with his views. He thought the noble lords ought to be ashamed of attempting to pass such a juggle on the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Auckland</member> <membercontribution>stated, that notwithstanding the very extensive information that he had heard communicated upon this subject from both sides of the house, be confessed that his mind was not sufficiently informed as to how far this measure might be considered to affect the administration of justice in that part of the island to which it was directed. He had listened attentively with the hope that some noble lord might so far enlighten his mind, and set his doubts upon this point at rest. However, as he was disappointed in this respect, he must beg leave to solicit the assistance of some noble lord, as to how he should now proceed in order to obtain the opinion of the judges on this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0260"/>
<col>489</col>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>expressed his regret that the noble lord had not thought of suggesting his desire to obtain further information at an earlier hour.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Auckland</member> <membercontribution>repeated, that he had hoped to have heard the legality of the question placed beyond all doubt by one of the learned lords on the other side of the house. The judges, however, were at hand, and might easily be called in, if it was their lordships' pleasure. [A call of move! move! from the treasury bench.] His lordship accordingly moved, that the judges be now called in.&#x2014;Upon which lord Hawkesbury and the lord chancellor suggesting the great inconvenience that would result from commencing such an inquiry at that late hour, it was agreed, at half after two o'clock in the morning, that the subject should be resumed on Monday next.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>Lord Robert Seymour, from the select committee appointed to try and determine the merits of the petition of Henry Allan, Deacon of the Fleshers of the city of Edinburgh, and one of the persons having right to vote in the election of a member for the city of Edinburgh, complaining of an undue election and return for the said city, informed the house, that the said committee had determined, that sir Patrick Murray was duly elected, and that the said petition appeared to the said committee to be frivolous and vexatious.&#x2014;Lord Temple called the attention of the house to a circumstance, of which he had yesterday given notice. He was glad to see the noble lord in his place, and was sure that noble lord would satisfy the house why when he had obtained leave of absence on the plea of a sick certificate, he had been told upon the division the other morning. Lord Henniker said, that the certificate alluded to by the noble lord had obtained him exemption merely from sitting on election committees. It was a particular certificate, not a general one; he threw himself upon the indulgence of the house. Lord Temple said, that as the explanation just made to the house must have been deemed satisfactory by the noble lord, he should persist no further in the business.&#x2014;Mr. Huskisson, in a committee of supply, moved the following sums: Three millions, for paying off outstanding exchequer bills for the year 1806; 1,500,000l. for ditto; 139, 138l. loyalty loan; 10,306l. to the Swedish convoy; and also that provision be
<col>490</col>
made for clothing the English and Irish militia, and for allowances to subaltern officers in time of peace. On the house resuming, the Report was ordered to be received on Monday.&#x2014;Mr. Huskisson moved, that an humble address be presented to his majesty, praying that his majesty would be graciously pleased to order that the Report of the Royal College of Physicians on the progress of the Vaccine Inoculation be laid before that house. Ordered.&#x2014;Mr. Bankes brought up a bill to prevent the granting of Offices in Reversion, or for joint lives, with benefit of survivorship, which was read a first time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[POOR, LAWS BILL.]&#x2014;Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for the house going into a committee upon this bill, and that it be an instruction to the committee to divide it into two or more bills as they may think fit. Previous to going into the committee, however, he thought it would be proper to say a few words explanatory of his intentions in regard to the bill, he had originally had the honour to introduce, as several gentlemen were not present upon a late occasion, when he briefly stated them. In consequence of intimations he had received from different parts of the country, of the opposition it was likely to meet with in certain points, he had thought it best to propose the division of and the abandonment of some portions of it. He intended, for instance, to abandon, 1st, that part of it which gives the power of requiring a previous adjudication of settlements. 2dly, that relative to the vestries, in so far as it gave two or more votes to persons possessed of large property in the parish. 3dly, that relative to the declaration of the assessments of stock in trade and personal property. After abandoning these parts of the original bill, he should propose to divide the remainder of it into four separate bills. The first of these would relate to education only; the second comprehend the relaxation of the law of settlements, by a residence for a certain number of years in certain parishes; vestries to be held at certain times, and notice to be given thereof. He meant to press upon the consideration of the house, the power of exempting cottagers, under a certain amount of income, from being included in the poor's rates, upon their own request; and the power of giving rewards to labourers under certain very limited circumstances, and also to repeal a part of the 9<sup>th</sup> of George I., which goes to drive into the workhouses, oppressively, all persons applying for parochial relief. He should likewise include the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0261"/>
<col>491</col>
power of building cottages at certain rents, for the residence of the poor, with a power of summary ejectments. These, and other topics, were to be comprehended in two bills, which he should press forward in the present session of parliament. The third bill, viz. that relative to the parochial fund of assurance, as being more novel than the other parts, he should propose to be read in the committee, but to be afterwards deferred to another session of parliament; and fourthly, the other bill relative to the regulation and equalization of the county rates. Having given this explanation, the hon. gent. concluded with moving that the Speaker do leave the chair.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Curwen</member> <membercontribution>commenced his speech with a handsome eulogium on the purity of the motives which actuated the hon. gent. but said he was sorry to add, that from many of that hon. gent.'s views upon this subject he materially differed. The hon. mover, in introducing this bill, had drawn a comparison between the Scotch and the English poor: he, for his part, could see no analogy whatever. He strongly deprecated the present system of poor-rates, and thought that it called loudly for parliamentary interference. The burden of the poor-rates on the middling orders was almost intolerable. He did not think that the proposed bill went in any way to alleviate that burthen. On the contrary, he contended that if the relaxation that was proposed was adopted, it would increase the poor-rates twofold; instead of their being three millions, they would be then six millions. Besides, it was to be recollected that the poor required immediate remedy; and even admitting that to be a remedy which was proposed, it was a most distant one. To the principle of funding he also objected. He did not think that the poor could fund, and even if they did it would encourage idleness. The plan of education he thought too expensive, and the system of building cottages and adjudging them to different tenants, would be productive of endless contention. He thought the corn acts of Mr. Pitt every way entitled to a preference, and though not in the habit of approving of that right hon. gent.'s administration, he felt it but justice to say, that his measures on this subject reflected the highest honour on his memory. He concluded with stating, that the poor-rates at present bore severely upon a deserving and industrious set of people: the lower orders of shopkeepers in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Plumer</member> <membercontribution>approved highly of the sys-
<col>492</col>
tem of education, and thought it was the most desirable object of the whole plan proposed by the hon. member. He was of opinion, that the poor's rates, if well and, properly administered, were fully adequate to the support of the poor, and of a system for their education. He did not think it necessary to abrogate the existing poor laws, because he was persuaded that an amelioration in the mode of administering them, would fully answer the purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>suggested the propriety of letting the bill go into the committee, in order that the hon mover might have an opportunity of bringing it out of the committee in the form in which he wished to submit his measures to the consideration of the house. This Would divide the consideration of the complicated question, and save a great deal of observation. After this proceeding, he hoped the hon. member would have no objection to give the house an opportunity of considering each of the distinct bills, by consenting to their re-commitment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fellowes</member> <membercontribution>said, that as the hon. gent. had signified his intention of letting two of the four hills lie over till next session; he thought it would be very adviseable in him to postpone the four bills, until they had been submitted to the cool and deliberate consideration of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Patteson</member> <membercontribution>took occasion no observe, that since he had presented a petition from Norwich, against one of the clauses contained in the original bill, he had been informed by the hon. mover that the nature of that clause had been entirely misunderstood by the petitioners.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>wished to see distinctly the whole extent of the plan proposed by the hon. gent. and, to give time for mature deliberation, he wished the measure to stand over to another session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Davies Giddy</member> <membercontribution>was fearful, lest, whilst endeavouring to remedy partial evils, more serious ones might be introduced, and particularly animadverted on that part of the bill for building cottages.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Parnell </member>, <membercontribution>in allusion to what had fallen from an hon. gent. respecting Mr. Pitt's Corn acts, adverted to the great advantage derived by Ireland from the Corn Intercourse act, passed by the late ministry, who had always paid so much attention to the interests of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Ralph Milbanke</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the present system of poor laws was a bad one, and that something ought to be done to re-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0262"/>
<col>493</col>
medy the evil, and the sooner the remedy was introduced the better.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Shaw Le Fevre</member> <membercontribution>would not oppose the committal of the bill, but he wished to know whether it was intended to abandon for the present the equalization of the county rates, as there was a bill now before the house for the equalization of the rates in Kent, which might be stopt, if the thing should be done by this bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, that he would endeavour to shew that the object of his hon. friend (Mr. Curwen) for stopping the accumulation of the poor rates immediately, was chimerical. It was very fine in language, but how was it to be done? As to the equalization of the county rates, he would wish to go on with it at present, and if he should abandon it for the present, it should be only in consequence of the opinion of others.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>would not object to the committal of the bill, but he had such serious objections to the greater part of it, that he thought it would be better to postpone the measure till next session.&#x2014;The Speaker left the chair, and Mr Hobhouse stated that the best way would be to read first, all the clauses that were to form the first bill, postponing the rest, and so on, with regard to the four bills into which it was intended to divide the present bill, find to negative such clauses as were not to be passed this session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>proposed that his hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread) should be allowed to proceed to form his four bills for the present, and that each should be re-committed, when they might be discussed.&#x2014;Mr. Simeon, Mr. Fellowes, and Mr. Pole Carew, wished the bills not to be pressed this session, as the house would not have an opportunity of discussing them in all their stages, usually allowed for discussion on bills of importance, the bill having already gone through some of its stages.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>observed, that when each bill came on, gentlemen would have an opportunity of urging what they should think necessary.&#x2014;The proposition of Mr. Wilberforce was at length agreed to. Mr. Whitbread presented his four bills. The house resumed, and the whole were reported.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<date format="1807-04-20">Monday, April 20.</date>
<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.] Lord Auckland</member> suggested to the house, whether it was really fair in the noble lords opposite,
<col>494</col>
to engraft upon a bill, which had undergone the most mature consideration, both in the house and in the country, a new bill, extremely varying, and altogether different in its principle? If the noble lords disapproved of the measure, would it not be more consistent with their duties to reject it at once, and then to come before the legislature with their own proposition, having given that proper parliamentary notice which the usage of the house had heretofore sanctioned, and which was peculiarly incumbent on the proposal of such an important measure, affecting as it did so great and respectable a part of the empire. But, if it was the intention of the house to go into a committee, he was anxious to know from the noble and learned lord (Eldon) in what way the necessary questions should be put to the Scotch Judges? and whether they were to be examined upon oath or not?</p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>thought the noble baron fully competent to decide, both on the manner and the matter of examining the Scotch Judges. With respect to the inconsistency and want of fairness attributed to those who supported the proposed amendments, he should only for himself say, that he never pledged himself to any further support, than a bare admission, that some alteration was necessary in the manner of administering civil justice in Scotland. Whether the present bill was rejected or not, he was not prepared to say what line of conduct he would pursue; whether, in the first case, he would propose any new measure; but he would certainly, if the house went into a committee, follow up his own opinion, by proposing and supporting such amendments, as to him appeared correct and advantageous.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>would not desert his duty and opinions, although other noble lords were careless in the performance of the one, and the recollection of the other. Whatever might be the fate of the bill which he had the honour to propose, he would continue to support its principle and provisions; and he trusted, for the credit of the house, that it would not suffer a measure to drop, to which, scarce a month ago, it gave the most unanimous support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howkesbury</member> <membercontribution>denied that the proposal for dividing the court of session into two chambers, instead of three, as originally proposed, was any violation of the principle of the bill, and therefore was a just and correct object for amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Kinnaird</member> <membercontribution>contended that the amend-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0263"/>
<col>495</col>
ment, as proposed by the noble baron, was complete alteration of the principle of the bill, which, after such uncommon industry, his noble friend had submitted to the consideration of their lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>took a survey of the different opinions expressed respecting the merits of the bill, and contended that not only a majority, but that of the best informed men in Scotland, had given it their approbation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>in explanation, said, that he would propose a motion which might bring the matter to issue. It was now his intention to move; that the committee be deferred till Thursday next, that their lordships might have time to make up their minds upon the subject, and that then he might take the sense of the house upon it, and afterwards, if necessary, move, that the committee be postponed for three weeks, for the purpose of allowing time to prepare another bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Athol</member> <membercontribution>suggested the propriety of discharging the order for the attendance of the Scotch judges.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville</member> <membercontribution>took up the suggestion and gave notice that on Thursday next he should move, that the order for the attendance of the Scotch judges be discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>was exceedingly surprised at this motion; and asked, if it was thought necessary to move for the attendance of the Scotch judges, upon a bill, the whole of which had been submitted for a full year to all those persons in Scotland who were most competent to form an opinion of its merits, how much more so must it not be necessary to have the opinion of the Scotch judges upon a bill, of the nature of which nothing at all had as yet transpired?&#x2014;The proposition of the lord chancellor was then agreed to: the house resolved itself into a committee, pro forma, and it was next ordered that the committee do sit again on Thursday.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-04-20">Monday, April 20.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition from W. C. Lindsey, esq. of the county of Tyrone, in Ireland, of whom he had not the least knowledge; but was a petition complaining of a grievance which was alleged to exist, and praying for relief: he therefore thought it his duty to present it to the house. The petition being read at the table, appeared to state a number of loyal actions performed by the petitioner in Ireland, which brought on the total ruin of his
<col>496</col>
family, and involved himself in the greatet difficulty. It therefore prayed the interposition of that honourable house in his behalf. Mr. Stewart bore testimony to the loyal exertions of this gentleman in Ireland during the late troublesome times. Mr. Wickham expressed himself confident that when the subject should be investigated, the earl of Hardtwicke would be found free from blame. The petition was then ordered to lie on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MUTINY AT VELLORE.] Mr. Howarth</member> <membercontribution>said, he thought it his duty to call the attention of the house to the late dreadful mutiny at Vellore; a mutiny, he had every reason to think, had been occasioned by an ill-timed military measure, tending to violate some of the customs of the natives. He wished to put a question to a right hon. gent. opposite, as president of the board of controul, and, according to the answer he should receive, he should, perhaps, think it his duty to found a motion upon this subject, he wished to know whether, in consequence of the accounts received from Madras, any steps had been taken, either to remove those persons who were so obnoxious to the natives, or to attempt to conciliate those who were so much irritated?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. S. Dundas </member>, <membercontribution>as president of the board of controul, answered, that he could assure the hon. gent., that the subject to which he alluded had been matter of serious consideration with the board of controul. Previous to the appointment of the present board, the court of directors did make a resolution as to the changes that were to take place in the Madras establishment. With regard to the causes of that unfortunate mutiny, he could only say, that during the very few days since the present board had been appointed, it was impossible that they could have made up their minds, or that they could ascertain that any dissatisfaction did actually still exist. The board having been so employed, no delay would take plate in adopting whatever steps might be judged necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Corry</member> <membercontribution>said, that, as the question was one which deserved the most serious consideration, he should think it would be advisable to delay adopting any measures, till the arrival of an officer, whom he knew to be upon his passage from India to this country. The officer he alluded to was sir John Craddock, who, from his situation at Madras, had had an opportunity of investigating the whole affair; and who, therefore, would be able to state the particulars with
<image src="S1V0009P0I0264"/>
<col>497</col>
more accuracy than could be done in any written dispatches.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH CHURCHES AND GLEBE HOUSES.] Mr. Wickham</member>, <membercontribution>in rising to make a motion on this subject, observed, that the papers on the table would shew the necessity of parliamentary interference, by larger and more liberal grants for the relief of the protestant church in Ireland. In 1803, he had laid on the table of the house a paper for the purpose of rousing their attention to this subject. Two bills were subsequently passed; one for the loan, without interest, of a large sum from the Board of First Fruits; the other for the advance of &#x00A3;50,000 by the lord lieutenant. On these bills, however, no steps had been taken. Entering into a comparative statement of the population of the two countries, he asserted, that the population of Ireland was half that of South Britain; but that the number of parishes in South Britain exceeded 10,000; while in Ireland the number of parishes was originally only 2436, and, by subsequent consolidations, was in the year 1791 reduced to 1120. This reduction was highly injurious to the protestant interest; and it appeared that, in the late troubles in Ireland, rebellion raged most violently, and most succesfully, in those districts in which the reduction had been the greatest. Having dwelt on the great importance of this subject, he concluded by moving, "That a select committee be appointed to take into consideration the several acts of parliament relating to the building, rebuilding, and keeping in repair, churches and glebe houses in Ireland, and to the purchase of glebe houses and lands there, and requiring certain returns to be made concerning the sufficiency state of, and condition, of such churches, for the regular performance of divine service therein; together with the several reports and papers relating thereto, and to the unions of parishes, that were laid before this house in the years 1803 and 1806 respectively; and that they do consider the said acts and papers, and examine how far the said acts, or any of them, have been found inadequate, and in what respect, for the purposes thereby intended; and do report the same together with their observations and opinion thereupon, to the house."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Duigenan</member> <membercontribution>said he would not oppose the motion of the right hon. gent. but he contended that the poverty of the people was so great in many places, that if it were not for the union of the parishes, the clergy would have devoured the people. Besides
<col>498</col>
this, there was an old act, passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, he believed, which authorised the lord lieutenant and privy council to divide or consolidate parishes according to the necessity of the case, and it so happened that where the patronage of the crown was most extensive, there the union of the parishes was more frequently apt to take place; for instance, if a gentleman had good interest and connexions of any weight, a single parish might be in so low a state, that it would not be worth his acceptance. He then would perhaps give the real statement of the case to his friend or patron, and afterwards a recommendation would come from the crown, that two adjoining parishes should be consolidated into one, which the bishop in such case mostly agreed to. He did not estimate the population of Ireland at much more than two millions, and the Protestant clergy would be very much oppressed and unable to maintain the respectability of their situation, if the union of parishes were not in many instances allowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>said, that many erroneous calculations had gone forth as to the actual number of inhabitants in Ireland. The number as laid down by Mr. Bushe, in the Irish Philosophical Transactions, amounted to upwards of four millions. Although the lords lieutenant of Ireland had the power of disuniting parishes, he had not found any instance in which they had done so. The state of the protestant church of Ireland did require the attention of the house, and he was sure they could not bestow their labours better than in discussing such an inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, he should certainly forward the object of the motion. He believed the money directed to be applied for the benefit of the church, by the acts in 1803, had never been properly applied. Many of the unions had been directed the privy council, on account of some of the parishes not being adequate to the maintenance of a clergyman. The proposed inquiry, therefore, appeared to be one of the most useful acts the house could engage in. One object on this side of the water had been to secure the residence of the clergy, but such an object could not be aimed at in Ireland, till such time as they had parsonage houses to reside in.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Maurice Fitzgerald</member> <membercontribution>stated, that, to his knowledge, some of the livings in the South of Ireland amounted to &#x00A3;1000, to &#x00A3;1500, and some even to &#x00A3;3000 a-year; and also
<image src="S1V0009P0I0265"/>
<col>499</col>
that, in some instances where a consolidation of livings and parishes had taken place, an attention to the religious duties of the people had been reversed; for no place of religious worship was provided, within the reach of the inhabitants; nor could such parishioners obtain baptism for their children, or the other rights of the church; and the consequence was, that the protestant inhabitants, in such places, had disappeared. He hoped, therefore, that a strict investigation would be set on foot, with a view of correcting such abuses.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Parnell</member> <membercontribution>thought, that the house ought to be put in possession of circumstances so material as those hinted at by the hon. gent. The population of Ireland, as computed by Mr. Bushe, amounted in the year 1788 to 4,080,000 inhabitants; the population of England and Wales, as the <i>Census</i> was taken in 1801, was 9,200,000; from this it appeared, that the calculations of the learned doctor were formed upon mistaken <i>data</i>&#x2014;The motion was then put and carried; and a select committee appointed accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH GRAND JURY PRESENTMENTS.] Mr. Maurice Fitzgerald rose</member>, <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, to move for leave to bring in a bill to alter and amend the mode of levying money by Grand Juries, in Ireland. He could now state, from the return on the table, that the enormous sum of half a million was raised by the grand juries, for bridges and cross-roads, exclusive of turnpike-roads, and the main lines of communication between the different parts of Ireland. This sum might not appear great compared with the revenue of England; but it was prodigious when compared with that of Ireland. The hon. gent. went on to state, that a land-tax would be an unpopular measure in Ireland, and yet that country was in reality subject to a land-tax, raised in the most objectionable way. The poor in Ireland were, of necessity, obliged to have some land, and after, by extraordinary industry, raising subsistence out of it, they were obliged to pay their tythes, and then their Grand Jury Tax, which fell upon the poor occupants; while the rich proprietor, being absent, payed none of the tax as a proprietor. What he proposed, therefore, was, to follow up the analogy of the regulation adopted by his right hon. friend (sir J. Newport), who had exempted from the house tax those whose rents did not exceed 61. per annum. He intended also to propose some new regulations with respect to presentments and the
<col>500</col>
proper accounting for the money. He would bring in the bill this session, that it might be printed and considered by the grand juries during the summer assizes. It would thus come forward next session, after all the consideration that could be requisite. He did not mean to alter the system of levying money by Grand Juries, but to subject it to the most beneficial regulations. He could not conclude without stating another motive which had induced him to propose this measure. At this moment, he observed, when all the views of the late ministry in favour of Ireland had been defeated, when the hopes of all those who from honest motives supported the Union were blasted &#x2014;when the Union was rendered merely nominal and barren, though there appeared no intention immediately to repeal it&#x2014;when the present government was founded on an interdict against Ireland, and existed under a pledge to withhold from the royal ear the grievances and complaints of the unhappy people of that country; at such a moment as this, he hoped the house would concur with him in the opinion, that at least all the practical benefits ought to be conferred on Ireland which could possibly be obtained. He concluded by moving for leave to bring in a bill to alter and amend the mode of levying money by Grand Juries in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>of the Exchequer had no objection to the bill proposed by the hon. gent. The course of proceeding with respect to the bill, as suggested by the hon. gent., he thought altogether unexceptionable, he rose for the purpose of deprecating for himself, and those connected with him, the supposition of their being disposed to intercept the prayers of any part of his majesty's subjects in their way to the royal ear, or to the presence of parliament, however his sentiments might differ from those of the right hon. gent. on some subjects connected with a large portion of the people of Ireland. He thought it right also to offer himself to the house, lest, if he should have sat silent while the Union was represented as a barren and useless thing, as a thing, the continuance of which was problematical, and its dissolution a thing seriously contemplated, lest such things, suffered to pass uncontradicted, should give rise to false and dangerous opinions abroad. The interests of the two countries were now so intimately combined, that a dissolution of the Union could not be contemplated without involving most material injury to both, however some matters of detail might, in the opinion of some,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0266"/>
<col>501</col>
be yet remote from a satisfactory arrangement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Parnell</member> <membercontribution>defended his hon. friend who might well be warranted in doubting of the policy of the Union, when the Imperial parliament was made the scene of disseminating religions dissentions, instead of diffusing, as had been promised by the authors of the union, political rights, by the extinction of religious divisions.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>had listened with great satisfaction to the statements of the hon. mover, because he had thrown some light upon the situation of the Irish poor. He wished that the gentlemen from Ireland would always endeavour to enlighten the house with regard to the internal state of that country. This would be much more important with respect to the poor of that country than the discussion of any great political privileges. Dr. Mc. Nevin, one of the persons who had been engaged in the rebellion, had stated in answer to a question put to him, when examined before a committee of the Irish house of commons, that the peasantry would not give the value of the ink in the pen with which the clerk was writing, for emancipation. The real happiness of the people depended more on the nature of their connection with their landholders and tytheholders, than upon those privileges. One of the best effects which he hoped for from the Union was the additional light which it would enable us to procure with respect to the situation of the people of Ireland. If Irish gentlemen, and members of parliament, would study and point out measures, calculated to promote the internal comfort and prosperity of Ireland, they would do far more real service to their country, than by recriminating upon those who could not hazard the strong measures they might wish. Whatever difference of opinion there might be as to higher questions of policy, all, he trusted, would concur in endeavouring to promote the reformation of the abuses in that country; and with this view, he wished it to be considered, whether it might not be possible for the voluntary exertions of the great landholders themselves to correct these abuses?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Maurice Fitzgerald</member> <membercontribution>begged leave to give an accurate and entire statement of the circumstance to which the hon. gent. had just adverted. This he could do with the most perfect correctness, as he had been a member of the Irish Committee. The question asked was, "what value the great body of the Catholics attached to what was
<col>502</col>
called emancipation?" The answer was, as the hon. gent. had stated, that they did not understand it, and that they would not give the value of the ink in the pen with which the clerk was writing for it. This was, perhaps, true; but then this question was followed by another, viz. "what he thought would have been the effects of granting this emancipation?" The reply was, that there was nothing the rebel leaders dreaded so much; as it would have taken the peasantry out of their hands entirely, and completely destroyed their hopes of establishing a republic in Ireland. This was the real state of the case. The hon. gent. then proceeded to state, that in Voting for the Union, he had combatted his earliest prejudices and feelings, and supported it with a view to the security of all establishments, and the restoration of a firm and lasting tranquillity to Ireland. He had done so under direct pledges on this subject sanctioned by the greatest names, and he never would have concurred in it on any other terms. But now, when he saw the evils aggravated, and none of the expected good effects produced, he, speaking for himself only, declared, that the Union was barren and nominal, and that no great benefit could result from continuing it.&#x2014;The motion was then put and carried.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-04-21">Tuesday, April 21.</date>
<p><member>[CAPTURE OF MONTE VIDEO.]&#x2014;The Earl of Moira</member> <membercontribution>rose, to call the attention of the house to certain observations and erroneous reports that had been sent abroad respecting a deficiency in the quantum of ammunition with which the troops were furnished in the attack on Monte Video. Nothing could be more cruel and mischievous than the dissemination of such rumours, without any concomitant explanation to account for the circumstance they alluded to. What must the soldiers feel, if they were taught to believe that they were sent into the field to encounter all its dangers, and expose their lives, without being provided with the usual and adequate means that might render their valour efficacious, and give them an equality of chance with the enemy? So far from that being the case, he believed he might venture to assert, that so far from the troops being left without a due proportion of ammunition, he was pretty certain, that a some-what greater proportion of ammunition than what had been allotted to a similar service (the capture of the Cape of Good Hope),
<image src="S1V0009P0I0267"/>
<col>503</col>
had been furnished to the troops who stormed Monte Video, but who were not destined for that service. Indeed, the difference of the nature of the two expeditions would shew, that the proportion of ammunition was larger on the part of those who were not destined for an expected attack. But these matters would be placed in their proper light by the return to the motion which he should now have the honour of submitting to their lordships. The noble earl then concluded with moving an humble address to his majesty, praying that he would be graciously pleased to order, "That there be laid before the house an account of the quantity of ammunition shipped on board the expedition, under the command of sir S. Auchmuty, and of the quantity usually furnished for similar expeditions".</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Galloway</member> <membercontribution>conceived himself to be somewhat the cause of the observations thrown out by the noble lord who spoke last. It was true, that he had animadverted on the deficiency of ammunition under which the brave troops laboured who had so gallantly stormed Monte Video. In making that observation he had rather in view to reflect additional lustre on that achievement, than to aim any attack by a side wind, or otherwise, on the late administration. No doubt, the inevitable inference from his remarks was a censure so far on the late ministry, but he did not single out any department of that government, much less any individual, as the peculiar object of his animadversion. If, however, the cap seemed to fit the noble earl, it was for that noble earl further to explain himself: he certainly was surprised that any noble lord, who belonged to the late administration, could have so far let himself down as to justify his conduct by squeezing it upon that of his predecessors in office, whom it was the constant study and practice of the late administration to disparage and decry in the public estimation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Spencer</member> <membercontribution>defended the character of the late ministry, and observed, that the noble earl (Galloway) should have waited the return to the motion, before he proceeded to animadvert upon the conduct of the late government. For his own part, he never disparaged the merits of the capture of the Cape of Good Hope; on the contrary, he was among those, who valued that possession much higher than any, perhaps, of the present ministry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Moira </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, observed, that the deficiency of ammunition, alluded to in the dispatches, was not owing
<col>504</col>
to the actual want of that article, but to the difficulty of introducing it within the trenches.<lb/>
The Earl of Galloway would leave to the house to judge of the defence set up by the noble lords opposite. He should stand upon the ground he had originally taken, and content himself with observing, that the general, employed by the late administration, had complained of the situation in which they had placed him; the officer,who achieved the capture of the Cape, had performed his duty, and made no complaint against any one.&#x2014;After a few words in explanation, the motion was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[PENRYN ELECTION&#x2014;SIR C. HAWKINS.]&#x2014;Mr. A. Wright</member> <membercontribution>moved the further consideration of the report of the committee upon the Penryn Election, which being read accordingly, and also the order for the attendance of sir Christopher Hawkins,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>stated, according to the custom in similar cases, that then was the time for the hon. bart. to deliver his sentiments upon the subject of the charge advanced against him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir C. Hawkins </member>, <membercontribution>being present in his place, said, he should leave his case entirely to the justice and liberality of the house, and then withdrew.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. A. Wright</member> <membercontribution>said, that nothing was more remote from his wishes than to hurt the feelings of the hon. baronet in question. The proceeding he was about to take, was not matter of option but of duty. The parties in the Penryn election were strangers to him. The situation he had the honour to hold on the committee was the sole cause why he called the attention of the house to the transactions contained in the report. The report contained ample grounds for the motions he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0268"/>
<col>505</col>
was about to submit. The laws which secured to the people a free and unbiassed exercise of the elective franchise, would be but a mere dead letter if the proceedings enumerated in the report were not animadverted upon. He was aware that no gentleman engaged in a controverted election, without depending much on the assistance of friends and agents, and the house would allow the benefit of that consideration, so far as it would weigh in estimating this case. But, he lamented to say, that in the present instance, the hon. baronet had committed the offences charged upon him, not by others but by himself. The former patron of the borough of Penryn having withdrawn, it was resolved by a large party of the electors to look out for a new patron, meaning by a patron a person who either was to be a candidate for the borough himself, or to recommend a candidate. The terms agreed upon by these electors on which to sell their votes and interest, were 24 guineas a vote, and 10 guineas to each of the overseers. A deputation, at the head of which were a Mr. Stona and the Rev. R. Dillon, waited on sir C. Hawkins, to whom he admitted the first offer was made, and the terms being acceded to, articles were drawn up and signed. These papers the committee had not been able, with every exertion, to get brought forward. But there was the parole evidence of a person of the name of Moon, who was himself one of the parties, of a Mr. Hitchcombe, and of a Mr. Chiltern, steward to sir C. Hawkins, to prove the facts, and the payment of a sum of money, by the direction of sir C. Hawkins, to Stona, how much Mr. Chiltern, though otherwise trusted in money matters, could not say, and an order to a person of the name of Rowe, to distribute this money among the voters. Mr. Chiltern could not say whether the notes were large or small, or how many were in the parcel. But there was proof that notes had been sent and distributed to the voters. The minutes of the evidence were before the house, and he felt it unnecessary to make any comment on them. The house would deal with them according to its own feelings. He should move, first, that the house should agree in the resolution of the committee, declaring that sir C. Hawkins had been personally, and by his agents, guilty of bribery and other corrupt practices in the late Penryn election; and he should then move, that the Attorney-General be directed to prosecute sir C. Hawkins, and the others implicated in the said offences.</membercontribution></p>
<col>506</col>
<p><member>Captain Herbert</member> <membercontribution>had hoped that he should have had abler assistance in the defence of the hon. baronet and that he should not have been left to manage the whole case by himself, inadequate as he was to such a task He had particularly to lament the absence of an eminent gentleman of the law (sir A. Pigot), on whose support the hon. baronet particularly relied. Some important affidavits also were expected.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir W. W. Wynne</member> <membercontribution>thought the house ought to be cautious of procrastination. A threat of dissolution had been thrown out, and reports to that effect were very current. If therefore, the house wished to mark its sense of the offences contained in the report now under its consideration, it ought to do so before it should be bereft of the power by the execution of the unparliamentary menace he referred to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lee Keck said </member>, <membercontribution>that as a member of the committee alluded to, he was convinced that there never was a stronger case made out for the consideration of the house, and it became them, consistently with their, dignity, to come to an immediate determination thereon. He looked upon the proceedings by the Attorney-General as the most moderate course that could possibly be adopted, under the circumstances of the case. The Committee had shown every disposition of leaning towards the accused; and, therefore, instead of proceeding further of their own accord, had made it the subject of a special report. If the house should be of opinion that any suspension of procedure should take place, he should bow with deference to their determination; but as a member of that committee, he protested against any suspension whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hurst</member> <membercontribution>did not see the case in so strong a light as the honourable member; and in a case in which the feelings and the character of one of its Members were so touch called in question, the house was called upon to give every possible facility to the defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>suggested, that the house could take no affidavits into account, and that his hon. and learned friend, who had been alluded to, could probably attend without inconvenience to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bankes</member> <membercontribution>wished to know from the hon. mover, whether there was any precedent for an instruction to the attorney general, to prosecute in a case of this kind; he had himself inquired, and he believed there was no precedent for such an instruction, without some further proceeding.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wright</member> <membercontribution>was not aware that there was

<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.]&#x2014;Lord Erskine</member> <membercontribution>took a brief retrospect of the proceedings hitherto had relative to the Scotch Judicature Bill, and observed that he considered it of importance, previous to the motion of his noble and learned friend on the woolsack, for rejecting the present bill, that certain questions should be put to the Scotch Judges, the answers to which might perhaps give a new turn to the opinion of the house. It was his wish, if the house should agree to these questions being put, that the Judges should be treated with all that respect which the house shewed towards the Judges of England, and that they should be allowed such time as they might think necessary to answer them. He therefore gave notice, that he should to-morrow move to put certain questions to the Scotch Judges in attendance; and concluded by moving, that the lord president and two senior Judges of the Court of Session, and such other Judges of that Court as may be in town, should attend the house to-morrow.&#x2014;Ordered.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[GOVERNOR OF CURACOA.]&#x2014;Colonel Wood</member> <membercontribution>moved, that there be laid before the house a copy of the letter of admiral Dacres to the lords commissioners of the admiralty, dated 8th Jan. 1807, inclosing a letter from captain Brisbane, dated Jan. 1. 1807, communicating the intelligence of the capture of the island of Curacoa. The hon. colonel, on being reminded by the Speaker, that it was usual for hon. members, when moving for public papers, to state the ground upon which they called for them, declared that it was with a view to an inqui-
<col>508</col>
ry into the ground of the removal of the late governor of Curacoa, and the appointment of another (a connection of the right hon. gent. Mr. Windham), that he had brought forward his motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>thought the motion objectionable, because no parliamentary ground had been laid for it. The usual course on the capture of any enemy's settlement was to appoint a provisional governor, until his majesty's pleasure should be taken upon the subject, and a governor appointed under the sign manual. Captain Brisbane had been appointed the temporary governor, as sir David Baird had at the Cape, and as had been the case at the capture of the Cape, last war, for certainly lord Macartney had not been the conqueror of the Cape. If the hon. colonel should ask why captain Brisbane had not been continued in the government, he had only to answer, because another had been appointed. It would be for the house to determine, whether the hon. gentleman's motion should be entertained on this ground, and after what they had heard lately of interference with the king's prerogative, he did not think the house would go into an inquiry, why his majesty had thought proper to appoint this or that person governor of that Island. If the person who had been appointed, was not qualified for the office, either by his profession or his services, the house might inquire. It would be a bad rule in general that the person who conquered an Island should be continued in the government of it. The man who made a musical instrument was not always the best to play upon it. There was, however, another question to be considered, whether Captain Brisbane himself would have liked that office? as an active command was thought generally preferable to the government of an Island. But it was for the house to decide whether the motion should be agreed to, or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>felt himself involved in considerable difficulty by the motion of the hon. Colonel. The house would be sensible that there was no instance of the exercise of the royal prerogative in which they ought so little to interfere, as the appointment of his officers by his Majesty. Many of the officers who had achieved conquests, had attracted particularly the attention of the crown, and were continued in the government of the settlements they conquered. But that was not a general or an absolute rule. As, therefore, the hon. colonel had not stated as the ground of his motion, that the per-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0270"/>
<col>509</col>
son who had been appointed was unfit for the office, he hoped he would save the house the delicacy of deciding upon a question, for which he neither had made out, nor professed to make out any case, by withdrawing his motion, especially as any discussion upon such a question, would rather detract from, than enhance the high and distinguished character of that gallant officer, who was the particular object of the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Wood</member> <membercontribution>said, he had brought forward his motion only in defence of the rights of a gallant officer, who had great claims upon his country. He did not mean in the smallest degree to object to the gentleman who had been appointed; but as it appeared to be the sense of the house, that the motion should not be entertained, he had no difficulty in withdrawing it, at the same time observing, that it would be more for the interest of the country, that ministers should appoint persons of high claims to such offices, rather than provide for their own connections.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[THIRD MILITARY REPORT]&#x2014;Lord A Hamilton rose</member>, <membercontribution>and, in allusion to a notice which he had given upon a former day, of a motion on the subject of the Third Report of the Commissioners of Military Enquiry, respecting the case of Mr. Alexander Davison, he now begged to ask the right honourable the chancellor of the exchequer, whether any proceedings had yet been taken by government, in consequence of that part of the report? or whether it was the intention of his majesty's present government to follow up that business in the same spirit as their predecessors?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>informed the noble lord, that no change whatever had taken place in the proceedings or intentions of government upon that subject; but he understood it was the intention of the preceding government that some further enquiry should take place previous to the commencement of any process, civil or military, thereon. He had felt it his own duty to make some enquiry as to the further proceedings which had since taken place, and he found that no diligence or exertion had been wanting on the part of those to whom that subject was referred, towards bringing it to a speedy issue.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[PENRYN ELECTION&#x2014;SIR C. HAWKINS.]&#x2014;Mr. Atkins Wright</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate upon the Special Report of the Penryn Election Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>stated, that the question in
<col>510</col>
the debate to be resumed, was, That the house do agree to the first resolution of the special report of the committee, namely, that sir C. Hawkins, by himself and his agents, was guilty of bribery and corrupt practices, with a view to influence the last election for Penrhyn,&#x2014;On the question being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Captain Herbert rose </member>. <membercontribution>He said he was disposed to allow the special report of a committee every due weight and authority; but was of opinion, that the house had the right to inquire into and discuss the grounds of that report. If a special report were final, then the first proceeding of the house would be to order a prosecution. But the house, on the contrary, ordered the minutes of the evidence to be laid on the table, in order to examine whether the report was borne out by that evidence. It was for the house to consider, whether the mortification of the person concerned, and the penalties to which he was subject, were not sufficient punishment without any further prosecution. Besides, unless the evidence were such, as to be satisfactory to the minds of a jury, the question ought not to be sent into a criminal court, because the acquittal by a jury, would take from the weight of a decision by a committee of that house. The hon. gent. then proceeded to comment upon various parts of the evidence to shew that the hon. bart. had not been intentionally guilty. He shewed that the evidence of Stona and Moon was contradictory with respect to the agreement, and that there was no evidence whatever that could be made the ground of a decision in a court of law. There was no proof of any agreement, or that any agreement had been acted upon: and he put it to the house whether, upon this doubtful evidence, they would, by agreeing to the resolution, prejudge a question that was to go to a jury. It was not unusual with the house to pass over special reports of committees, for instance, in the Berwick and Cricklade cases. And upon these grounds he moved an amendment, that the debate be adjourned to this day three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord A. Hamilton</member> <membercontribution>had attended particularly to the evidence for the last five weeks, and declared the impression upon his mind to be the very reverse of that stated by his hon. friend. This appeared to him one of the strongest cases that had ever been brought before parliament. He had served upon many committees, and knew the scrupulousness with which their reports were
<image src="S1V0009P0I0271"/>
<col>511</col>
drawn up. There was no case in which greater confidence should be placed in the report of a committee than when it went to criminate a member of that house. The speech of his hon. friend was not in mitigation, but for the complete abandonment of punishment. He should therefore vote for the resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Captain Herbert </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, asserted that he was authorised to state, that no agreement existed at the late election, and declared upon his honour, after every inquiry he could make, that no such agreement existed at that election.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lee Keck</member> <membercontribution>argued from the evidence, to shew, that the report of the committee was fully borne out by it. He did not think it just or fair, that the hon. baronet, because he had secured his seat for another place, should be in a different situation from others under similar circumstances, because so far as Penryn was concerned, he was no longer a member of that house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. E. Stewart</member> <membercontribution>contended that the house had delegated its powers to the committee, and that it had then only to determine what proceeding it should adopt upon the report. One fact was certain, that the hon. baronet had agreed to give 24 guineas to each voter, and the gentlemen who had read the minutes would agree that this was one of the grossest instances of barefaced bribery that had ever been brought under the consideration of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hurst</member> <membercontribution>explained the reasons that governed his conduct, both in the committee and since. He considered the evidence with reference to the criminal law of the country. The proceedings upon that evidence might be for the expulsion of the hon. baronet, or for a criminal prosecution, and before they should determine upon either, he thought the house ought to consider whether the evidence was such as to bear it out. The evidence of Stona and Moon was contradictory, and if he were to decide, he should say, that neither was to be believed; concluding therefrom that no agreement existed. He had no knowledge of the hon. baronet until after the report of the committee, when in a conversation he had with him, that hon. baronet had declared to him upon his honour, that no agreement was ever entered into by him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir W. W. Wynne</member> <membercontribution>said, that whatever sir C. Hawkins might deny, still, as his agent (who must be considered as an unwilling witness,) had admitted it upon his oath, he could not but believe that there was such an
<col>512</col>
agreement. If the agreement was of a different nature, and not for giving twenty-four guineas a man to the voters, why did not sir C. or his agents produce that agreement which had taken place? Mr. Stona said he burnt those papers; but it was easy to guess what sort of papers those were that people were so eager to burn. He trusted, therefore, that the house acting upon the principle, that he who bought his seat would be most likely to sell his vote, would, with a view to purify itself, adopt the same course that had been pursued in the Cricklade, Shoreham, and lately in the Aylesbury case, and throw open the borough of Penryn, with a view to prevent similar bribery in future.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>said, that he knew nothing more of the present matter than what he had heard and read in the course of this evening's discussion. He thought that too much had been said on the subject of purifying the house in the estimation of the country. We ought always to be actuated by such a motive, but the great object should be first to know our duty, and then to pursue it. Such language seemed rather to suggest, that some victim should be sacrificed for the reputation of the rest. He lamented that the house had not seen reason to hear the indirect evidence which an hon. member had proposed to introduce. He wished then to lay aside all extrinsic considerations; and concluded with saying, that he would not vote at all on the question, not feeling competent to decide upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>professed, that he was not in the same situation with his right hon. friend. He had examined the evidence with the utmost attention, and thought the case perfectly clear. But this was not the time to enter into the evidence. The committee appointed by the house had come to a decision, and the house were now to determine whether their resolution should be adopted. They were not calling for a victim, and it was material to come to a decision, for if it was not come to now, it would not come to it at all. What would the country think, should the house blink the present question, and say, in effect, that the offending member shall not be punished?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>had read the report with attention, and thought the resolution of the committee well warranted by facts. He conceived the house were in the situation of a grand jury, and fully warranted by the evidence to send the matter to a special jury in a court of justice, where it would be tried with perfect impartiality.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0272"/>
<col>513</col>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>did not think the discussion ought to be deferred.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lethbridge</member> <membercontribution>thought that there were grounds for putting the hon. member on his trial, though the opinion of this house was not binding in any other court.&#x2014;The previous question was then put and negatived.&#x2014;A discussion then arose on the original question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>thought the resolution was not founded on evidence sufficiently clear. He observed that there had been corrupt practices, but he did not think that actual bribery had been proved. He drew a distinction between agreeing to bribe, which he thought had been proved, and actual bribery which he thought had not been proved. In support of this opinion, he commented at considerable length on the evidence in the report of the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Leycester</member> <membercontribution>argued also at considerable length from the evidence, from which he drew an opposite conclusion, and considered that bribery had been made out.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hurst</member> <membercontribution>repeated his former arguments, and added, that giving the pound notes instead of a dinner could not be considered as bribery.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Swann <memberconstituency>(member for Penryn)</memberconstituency></member>, <membercontribution>declared, that he never heard of such an agreement, at the time he joined his interest with sir Christopher, and if he had believed that there was such an agreement, he would not have joined him. He would state for himself, and for 162 freemen of Penryn, who voted for him, that they knew of no such agreement, and if they had, they would not have given sir Christopher their independent votes. [A laugh.] He knew the town of Penryn well: they had never asked from him even a single solitary shilling, and he knew they were not corrupt. [A laugh.] As for the business of the one pound notes, it was this: he had always considered it necessary to follow an old custom, which, perhaps, would be "more honoured in the breach than in the observance," of shewing some attention to his constituents. Instead, however, of opening public houses, he found that it was less expensive<ob/> to distribute small sums of 5 or 10s. a man. When a compromise was made between his friends and those of sir Christopher, it was thought right that sir Christopher should give a dinner; but afterwards, the one pound notes were substituted in the place of a dinner, and were certainly only meant as a mark of attention, and by no means as a bribe, as no opposition was expected in the borough, nor was there
<col>514</col>
a probability of an election soon taking place.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>thought the house must feel, that after the report of their select committee, they were bound to take some proceedings on it, and order a prosecution. It did appear to him, that there was upon the face of the report sufficient evidence to justify the resolution that the committee had come to. He preferred a prosecution to expulsion, as it appeared to him a little unfair that he should be first punished by expulsion, and then sent to a trial, where, perhaps, he might be acquitted. If he had been returned for but one place, the house could have done nothing more than order a prosecution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bankes</member> <membercontribution>said, there was no instance on the Journals of a member being ordered to be prosecuted, and yet allowed to keep his seat. He instanced the cases of Mr. J. Ridge, in the reign of queen Anne; Mr. Carnagie, in the year 1715; and sir A. Grant, who had all been expelled from the house, and afterwards ordered to be prosecuted. The Shepherds, father and son, were expelled and prosecuted for bribery, in the year 1700. If sir Christopher had been returned for but one place, the report of the committee would have immediately deprived him of his seat; and he did not think that he should be in a better situation, because he had been returned for three places.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>was sorry to differ from the hon. gent. who spoke last; but he thought that nothing was fairer than to send the member to another tribunal, and the house might afterwards act upon its decision.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir W. W. Wynne</member> <membercontribution>thought that when a committee had reported any member, of that house to be guilty of bribery, he should be no longer permitted to sit among them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. S. Bourne</member> <membercontribution>thought, that the house ought not both to inflict the punishment of expulsion, and order a prosecution. He much preferred the latter course, and thought that if he were found guilty upon a trial in a court of justice, his expulsion from that house would be merely a matter of course.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, that he could easily conceive a case, although he would not say that this was that case, where a person might be acquitted in a court of justice, and yet where the house of commons might be so convinced of his criminality, as to think it necessary to expel him. In the present instance, however, he was for the prosecution.&#x2014;The gallery was then cleared, but we understood that the resolution of the committee
<image src="S1V0009P0I0273"/>
<col>515</col>
was adopted without going to a division. While strangers were excluded, Mr. Atkins Wright moved, That the Attorney General be directed to prosecute sir C. Hawkins for bribery, &amp;c.; to which motion Mr. Bankes moved, as an amendment, to leave out all the words after "That," and to substitute, "sir Christopher Hawkins be expelled."&#x2014;After debating some time, Mr. Bankes's amendment was withdrawn. The original motion for an address to his majesty, praying him to direct the attorney general to prosecute sir C. Hawkins, was carried, as were also similar motions for the prosecution of eighteen persons of the committee of the electors of Penrhyn, who had fixed the price for which the votes were to be sold, and who had invited sir C. Hawkins, by a deputation from their body, to purchase them.&#x2014;It was moved by Captain Herbert, that Moon, an accomplice in the transaction, but who had given evidence before the select committee of the house of commons, should also be prosecuted by order of the house. This motion was resisted on the ground of his having already given evidence before the committee of the house, and of his testimony being essential to the prosecutions that had been ordered. The house divided on this question: For Captain Herbert's motion 13, against it 46.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<date format="1807-04-23">Thursday, April 23.</date>
<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The order having been read for the attendance of the lord president and other judges of the court of session, five of the judges of that court, namely, the lord president, the lord justice clerk, lords Glenlee, Cullen, and Newton entered the house, and took their seats in chairs provided for them in a space inclosed without the bar.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Erskine</member> <membercontribution>then addressed their lordships on the important subject under consideration, the end and object of which was a considerable improvement in the administration of civil justice in Scotland. His lordship took a review of the proceedings which had taken place in the present and in the last session, in reference to the bill now pending before their lordships, and noticed the general admission that evils did exist in some parts of the administration of the Scots laws, which were even felt to affect that house in its appellant jurisdiction, and for all which a speedy and efficacious remedy was declared to be necessary. For these objects, he held the bill brought in by his
<col>516</col>
noble friend to be highly beneficial. He argued forcibly for the introduction of Trial by Jury as recognised by that bill; and which, with such an arrangement of the business as would separate the law from the facts, would in the Scots courts constitute a great part of that remedy. He likewise argued in support of various other parts of the bill, and the superior advantages of a division of the court of session into three chambers, instead of two, as proposed by the other bill of which the noble lord (Hawkesbury) had given notice. A division of the court into two would be a good thing, he said, as far as it went; but it would not operate as a remedy to the evils complained of; no more than if, should he have sent for a surgeon to perform an operation on him, that surgeon, instead of the faithful discharge of professional duty, should make him a present of a horse or a carriage, or set him down in his will: these would all be very good things, and argue a very friendly disposition in his surgeon, but would be no remedy whatever for his complaint. He also argued, that the court of review, as originally proposed, was not contrary to the spirit of the Scots union; and that some establishment of the kind was essentially necessary to diminish the number of appeals. In the course of his speech the noble lord adverted to eighteen or nineteen questions, which he read, and which he proposed should be put to the learned judges then before the bar, for their opinions upon the same. The first question, which was afterwards read from the Wool-sack and the question distinctly put upon it, was to the following effect: "Whether, in the action for the recovery of personal property, or for the vindication of private wrong, especially where parole proof was necessary, the expenses of the proceedings, according to the present mode and practice of the court of session, did not, in very many cases, greatly exceed the value of the thing at issue, independent of delay and other inconveniences?" The leading propositions in the subsequent questions were&#x2014;<ob/>, "To learn what degree of power the Scots courts now possessed within themselves, to reform the inconveniences and evils complained of. 2, Respecting the preferable division of the court of session into two or into three chambers, with a view to the more efficacious remedy of the evils complained of. 3, Respecting the effects of the introduction of Trial by Jury into civil causes; and of enabling the court to separate the consideration
<image src="S1V0009P0I0274"/>
<col>517</col>
of law from that of fact. 4, Respecting the diminution of the number of appeals to the house of lords, which may be naturally expected from the establishment of a court of review; and whether an establishment of the kind would not be necessary for that purpose. And lastly, whether the establishment of such a court, with judges, as proposed by the bill, he inconsistent with the 18th and 19th articles of the union with Scotland?"&#x2014;The first question was put and agreed to. On the question for proposing the subsequent queries.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>made a few observations, importing, that the whole of these should be considered as referring to, and arising out of the measure he had the honour to propose. There was no other bill before the house, no other measure could therefore be regularly adverted to. He deprecated the idea of the least ground existing for an apprehension that any thing proposed would overturn the court of session, or clash with the articles of union.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Athol</member> <membercontribution>felt it incumbent on him to allude to the situation in which the law lords of Scotland were then placed in that house, and expressed his wish that the learned lord's proposed bill for placing the Scots and Irish judges on an equality in these respects, were brought in; and which he seemed to think might be passed before it would be necessary for them to deliver their answers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>deprecated every idea that the situation in which those respected personages then stood, was in the smallest degree disgraceful, and adverted to the impracticability of getting such a bill through, as hinted by the noble lord.&#x2014;The question was then put, and the remaining queries were ordered to be put to the Scots judges.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>then inquired of these learned judges as to the time at which they could conveniently give their answers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord President</member> <membercontribution>replied, that for his own part, he had no objection to answer the queries forthwith, if such were the pleasure Of the house; but his learned brothers might think differently; perhaps tomorrow, or Monday might therefore be more convenient. He wished permission from the house to offer a few observations to their lordships. [A general cry of go on! go on!] The lord president was then entering upon some degree of detail; upon which, the lord chancellor informed him he must confine himself to the subject of the ques-
<col>518</col>
tion. The lord justice clerk observed, that much would depend on the consideration, whether the answers were to be delivered verbally or in writing. He also adverted to the inconvenience of detaining the Scots judges much longer in town; and hoped their lordships would not fix upon a longer interval than Monday for receiving the answers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>stated, that the rule was, that the reasonings upon which the opinions were founded should be delivered <i>viva voce</i>; but that the results should be in writing&#x2014;The questions, as proposed, were then ordered to be printed, and that the Scots judges then present do attend to deliver their answers on Monday next at three o'clock.</membercontribution></p>
<p>[LOAN INTEREST BILL.] The house having resolved itself into a committee on the Loan Interest bill,</p>
<p><member>Lord Auckland</member> <membercontribution>said, that the general purport of the bill was necessary towards the due execution of the great finance measure brought forward by the late government. That measure had provided an extraordinary annual supply of 32 millions, during an indefinite continuance of the present war, and had assigned, for the liquidation of that supply, certain proportions of the war duties in a revolving series of 14 years; and also certain excesses of the sinking fund. This important object would be attained with a strict regard to the public faith, and without any new taxes or new burthens for the first 3 years, nor for any subsequent years, except to a small and imperceptible amount. But the new ministers had made a change in the bill as handed over to them by their predecessors, and to that change he wished to call their lordship's attention. Their lordships would recollect, that in the year 1797 recourse was first had, by the pre-eminent minister of that day, to the principle of raising a considerable portion of the war-supplies within the year. That principle was pursued in the convoy-duties, the treble-assessed taxes, and the income tax. In 1802, on the return of peace, Mr. Addington (now lord Sidmouth) found the income tax charged with 56 millions, and an unfunded debt of 40 millions. The noble lord took the bold resolution to fund the whole 96 millions, and to provide permanent taxes to pay the interest. It was a resolution dictated by a judicious, provident, and energetic policy. When the war broke out again in the following year, the noble lord reverted to Mr. Pitt's system of raising a large proportion of the war-expenditure
<image src="S1V0009P0I0275"/>
<col>519</col>
within the year, and accordingly proposed the property-tax, and various war-duties on excise and customs. Subsequent additions had been made to those several modes of supply, and particularly in the last session, when the late chancellor of the exchequer had raised the property-tax from 6&#x00BC; to 10 per cent. In the result, the whole annual produce of the war-taxes is now estimated at 21 millions; of which 11&#x00BD; are furnished by the property-tax, and 9&#x00BD; by the excise and customs. Lord Grenville's ministry, in adjusting their plan of finance, had determined at all events not to burthen the country with the property-tax beyond the duration of the war, and had therefore pledged only the war-duties of customs and excise for the liquidation of such war-loans as might remain unredeemed on the return of peace. This eventual restriction had been censured and resisted by their opponents as unnecessary and unwise. But what was the line now adopted? Those who contended that the whole consideration Should have been left open and unfettered to the return of peace, have still further restricted the pledge in question, and have confined it to the war duties of excise. In objecting to this restriction, he (lord Auckland) did not mean to argue that the pledge was insufficient, though certainly it was a violation of the engagements made with the contractors for the loan. But he strongly censured the selection made, and thought it the worst that could have been adopted. The war duties of excise, so far as they affect the malt, cannot be continued after the war without injury to the landed property; so far as tobacco, spirits, and tea, are concerned, those duties cannot exist after the return of peace, with safety to fair trade and to the revenue. The war duties on customs, which were at all events set free by the change made in the bill, consisted of duties on imports and exports, and on the tonnage of shipping. He could not hesitate to assert, that some of those duties were the least exceptionable of any of the war duties, to be continued on the return of peace. It appeared, however, in the votes of the house of commons, that a petition against the finance measure had been presented by certain persons, on the part of what they called "the shipping interest;" and that petition was understood to have occasioned the selection to which he objected; He had reason to believe that the petition was signed by very few of the respectable men who possess the shipping property of the British empire; but at any rate it was founded in
<col>520</col>
a total misconception or misrepresentation of the subject. The tonnage duty in question and its produce wore so inconsiderable, that they could not have any perceptible effect, even if exclusively levied on British ships; but, in fact, the duty is imposed on the ships of all nations, and, therefore, so far as it may operate, the competition was left where it was found. The petitioners are equally inaccurate in asserting that injury had resulted to them from the encouragement given to the trade of neutral nations. It would be an untruth on their part to say that any encouragement had been given by the late government to neutral trade, beyond what the law of nations, as declared by the court of admiralty, had allowed; or beyond what is necessary to the export of our manufactures, the interests of which would otherwise be sacrificed, without doing any good to what is called "the shipping interest." Parliament had h<ob/>eard much of this same "shipping interest," and through the same agency, in the last session. And it had been made the watch-word against the American intercourse bill, the effects of which bill, he was prepared to prove, had been peculiarly beneficial to British shipping. He had no doubt, that if amidst the debates on that bill, the late ministry had, then been removed, the whole nation would have been stunned with the same senseless and unjust cry about the "shipping interest," which is raised at the present day respecting a more serious subject. The words "shipping interest," and "the protestant church," vibrate forcibly on a British ear. He reprobated the misuse of such senseless appeals, and was not afraid to reprobate them, because no individual in either house of parliament had shewn himself more openly, more zealously, or more uniformly, attentive to the interests of British navigation, or to the more essential of all public objects, the safety of the church of England. He must lament the political depravity of those who raised such cries, and the folly of those who were misled by them. Little minds have in all ages availed themselves of these occasional perversions of popular opinion; great minds have always been apt to disregard and undervalue them. War-whoops of this description had been made the chief engines in the dissolution of the French monarchy; and the mere word "aristocrat" had brought to the guillotine thousands and tens of thousands of the nobility and magistracy. His lordship concluded his speech with stating several details
<image src="S1V0009P0I0276"/>
<col>521</col>
of the flourishing state of commerce and revenue as exhibited in the printed accounts which he had laid before the house. Through the whole struggle of the last fourteen years, our progressive means had kept pace with our progressive expenditure: and the finance measure as prepared by his noble friend (lord Grenville), and as explained with such eloquence by the late chancellor of the exchequer, had taught the country to place a well-founded confidence in its own energies, and to look without dismay to the difficulties and dangers of the war, to whatever length it may be carried, by our powerful and implacable enemy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Montrose</member> <membercontribution>thought it necessary to say but a very few words upon the subject. He had nothing to do with any cry that had been raised against the late ministers, and he should therefore confine himself to the amendment in the bill to which the noble lord objected. It was well known to those acquainted with the subject, that during a period of war a great quantity of tonnage was employed by government, and that on a peace taking place all this tonnage being thrown out of this employ, there was for 2 or 3 years a greater quantity of tonnage than could find a market. It was therefore of great importance to release the tonnage at a period of peace from the war duty, and it was with this view that it had been taken out of the pledge as originally contained in the bill. The security left to the public creditor was amply sufficient in the duties which remained pledged, and therefore he did not see that there was any well founded objection to the alteration in the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>went over the financial plans of his own administration, of the administration which succeeded, and the principal points of the plan of the late ministers, of which he highly approved. He also approved of the conduct of the present ministers, with respect to the disposition which they shewed to carry into effect the plan of the late ministers. With respect to the alteration which had been made in the present bill, he thought it had better not have been made, but as it only nominally altered the nature of the security pledged to the public creditor, leaving in fact an amply sufficient security, he thought there was no material objection to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Kinnaird</member> <membercontribution>commented strongly upon the absence of ministers on the discussion of a question of considerable importance on a former evening, and upon the continued
<col>522</col>
absence of a noble duke, who from his situation must be peculiarly qualified to give the house information upon a subject like the present.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Mulgrave</member> <membercontribution>defended the alteration in the bill, and commented upon the pernicious effects of the system of Necker in France. He did not mean to apply this to the plan of the late ministers, but it was necessary in point of principle, that these things should be adverted to. The public creditor was amply secured under the bill as it now stood.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>said, be differed from the noble lord on the cross-bench (Sidmouth), with respect to the disposition of the present ministry to carry into effect the financial plan of the late ministers. He, on the contrary, thought they had shewn a disposition to frustrate, and as far as possible, render it nugatory. The present measure, it should be recollected, was only a very small part of that plan; and he much feared that they would not have to discuss the remaining parts in that house. Much had been said and written, to prove that the late ministers might have easily raised taxes to provide for loans; and it had been charged against them, that they had only brought forward taxes which their predecessors had rejected. Some of those, however, who made such charges must know, that Mr. Pitt, in 1805, found it impassible to raise more than 400,000l. by new taxes, without resorting to 10 per cent. on the assessed taxes. In like manner, the late ministers found themselves equally incapable, in 1806, of raising more than 400,000l. by new taxes, without also resorting to 10 per cent. on the assessed taxes. It was, however, evident, that the assessed taxes could not be carried any further; and, under this difficulty, the late ministers had to consider of a plan by which the war might be carried on with all the energies of the country, and without imposing any additional burdens, or, at least, if they were, that they should be of trifling amount. The only effective plan which could, under such circumstances, be resorted to, they found to be a revolving series, that was to say, that so large a sinking fund should be created, by means of pledging the war taxes, for the extinction of the new debt incurred, that the debt should be extinguished before the whole of the war taxes should be thus pledged; thus leaving the portion of the war taxes first pledged at liberty to be again applied to a like purpose, and thus affording the means, of carrying on the war for an indefinite pe
<image src="S1V0009P0I0277"/>
<col>523</col>
riod. This system had met with the approbation of parliament and the public, and on the contract being made for the last loan, which was one of the most advantageous contracts for the country ever entered into, some person near him having observed upon the favourable nature of the terms of the loan for the country, the person who was then signing the contract declared that it was the consequence of the financial plan then before parliament. Thus the whole amount of the war taxes were pledged to the public creditor. It never before had been thought of to take away a specific pledge from the public creditor. It did not become him to speak of the plan, in the forming of which he, as one of his majesty's late ministers, had a share, but the present ministers found that they could not bring forward any one better. Not being able to form a better plan, they must, however, do something; they must, they thought, make some alteration, and thus had arisen the alteration in the bill, which was a direct violation of public faith; and not content with altering the nature of the security, they placed it on those taxes which were justly considered to be the very worst which could be so pledged, and which had been so considered in another place by gentlemen now in administration. He was perfectly aware that the security which remained, namely, 6,000,000l. was amply sufficient to pay 1,200,000l.; but still he contended, that the alteration was a violation of public faith, inasmuch as the whole of the taxes included in the original plan were the specific security to the public creditor. His noble friend on the other side (lord Mulgrave) had spoken of the plans of Necker, and the ruinous consequences which they produced in France. 'The plan of Necker was simply this, he borrowed money without making provision for the payment of the interest, and then added the interest to the loan of the next year, and so on successively. Such a system must necessarily lead to ruin, and he wished to dwell particularly upon this system of borrowing money one year and adding the interest to the loan of the next, because he bad reason to believe that a plan was in contemplation to propose to parliament, the object of which was this very system, namely, to borrow money one year and add the interest to the loan of the next. He conjured noble lords on the other side not to give ear to such a plan, if any such should be proposed to them, as it must inevitably produce the most ruinous and the most deplorable con

sequences. To impute improper motives to any ministers, or to any legislators, he knew was irregular; but he must take leave to say, that if his majesty's present ministers had determined upon the ruin of the new system of finance, they could not have adopted measures more effectual for that purpose than they had already pursued. He did not wish to alter the bill now before the house; their lordships knew why he did not: it would involve a question of privilege between the two houses, as it was a money bill; but he protested against the amendment introduced into it by the present ministers; and he did the same thing against the system which, he knew, was preparing upon finance. He protested too against the clamour which was raised by persons denominating themselves the shipping interest of this country, against the American intercourse bill, which was, in truth, a bill to save the West-Indies from famine, and to save us from breaking the law passed for that purpose. He protested no less against the conduct of those who circulated alarms concerning dangers which they knew did not exist. They knew, said his lordship, that the measure lately proposed to parliament did not endanger the established church of this country; they knew there was no danger in that measure, at the very time they were so busily employed in raising a clamour against it. I know they knew it; for this reason, because there is hardly one of his majesty's present ministers who has not come forward with promises to make concessions to the Roman catholics&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>Lord Grenville </member>. <membercontribution>My lords, the bill before your lordships is a bill for providing for a supply to support the public service, and the government of this country; and if the noble lord who calls me to order, knew properly the order of debate in parliament, he would be aware, that, upon the discussion of such a measure, every thing that has a bearing on the conduct of those who compose the king's government, is the subject of debate, if necessary; that a member of parliament may always bring any part of that government before the house of which he is a member, on the discussion of a question of supply.</membercontribution></p>

of this house to say that any person in his majesty's confidence circulates opinions which he knows to be untrue?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville </member>. <membercontribution>I hope the noble earl will not forget that he concurred in a measure, when he was lord lieutenant of Ireland, when the Irish. parliament was advised by him, to consider the state of the Irish catholics.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Westmoreland </member>. <membercontribution>The noble baron is perfectly welcome to allude to any part of my conduct, and I am ready to defend it; but I do not see what application it has to the matter now before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville </member>. <membercontribution>My lords, I know the right which belongs to a member of parliament; and nothing shall deter me from its exercise on occasions that call for it. I know that I have a right in this house to canvass the conduct of every part of the government, on a question of supply. I know I have a right to allude to the clamours which may have an effect on the public. My observations on what passed in Ireland was for the purpose of vindicating myself from the imputation of having said what I know would have been unparliamentary; I mean alledging of a member of parliament, that he had circulated opinions which he knew were not true. That I did not say: I had said, among other things, that to agree to the amendment which has been in this bill was, in my opinion, highly impolitic; and I then observed, that endeavours had been made to circulate unfounded clamours; but I think it impossible for any of his majesty's present ministers to countenance such clamours, because there is hardly one of them who has not been a party to a proposition which was made in parliament, for much greater concessions to the Roman catholics than that which was lately proposed, and upon which such endeavours have been made to excite a clamour; to create a false and unfounded alarm of danger to the country, and especially to the established church. I say, again, that his majesty's present ministers must be convinced of the fact, that no danger could arise to this country from the measure which was proposed in favour of the Roman catholics; because there is hardly one of them who has not in parliament assented to a measure of much more extensive concession to the Roman catholics; and more especially the noble earl, who has thought it proper to call me to order; for the measure he proposed to be adopted in Ireland was much more in favour of the Roman catholics than the measure lately proposed. I
<col>526</col>
say farther, that the system of finance which I suspect to be about to be adopted by his majesty's present ministers, but, above all, the clamour which is about to be introduced into this country on the subject I have alluded to, may, if not repressed, lead to the miseries which we have witnessed in France.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Harrowby</member> <membercontribution>observed, that he had never known an instance where the terms agreed to by a chancellor of the exchequer, in his private room, were held to be binding on parliament and the king.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord.Grenville</member> <membercontribution>informed the noble lord that resolutions had been passed by the house of commons previous to the negotiation of the loan.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Harrowby</member> <membercontribution>still maintained that there did not exist sufficient ground for him to alter his opinion on the subject. Was not the faith of the public pledged for 20 years? The great and comprehensive mind of his noble friend, might enable him to have a view of things which were not cognizable to persons who possessed a more moderate share of understanding; but, from all the details of the circumstances relative to the loan, and from the application of the war taxes, it appeared clearly to him, that the measure was too extensive in its nature and effects, to be considered binding on parliament. According to this plan the sinking fund would be lowered, when other funds were raised by the general prosperity of the country. He insisted that it was imprudent to state what we should do at a time when it was impossible for us now to ascertain what contingencies might possibly arise.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>maintained that every possible care was taken to provide against every contingency. The public faith, in fact, was more than kept with the public creditor, whilst, at the same time, the plan was such that it secured the public, as far as any general and comprehensive system possibly could do, on the different changes in the price of the funds.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>said, that although he felt serious objections to this financial measure, yet he should not object to the bill's going through parliament for the present year, trusting that it would still remain open to the future and deliberate examination of parliament, and that the opinions which other persons might be inclined to offer on the subject, would meet with due attention. From the collision of such sentiments, he trusted that they would be better able to form an opinion as to the measures most proper to be adopted. He denied that there
<image src="S1V0009P0I0279"/>
<col>527</col>
was any breach of faith with the public creditor, although the duties upon exports and imports, and upon tonnage, were excluded from those war taxes mortgaged for 20 years. The most that could be advanced was, that the contractor had a diminished security, but that remaining security was amply sufficient. He also denied, that the faith of parliament was, in any measure, pledged to abide at all events by any proposal entered into between the chancellor of the exchequer, and the contractors of the loan, so as to preclude all examination and discussion in that house of parliament. He considered that it was, in itself, a step, rash and improvident, that the duties upon tonnage, and upon exports and imports, should be mortgaged and pledged to the loan contractors. The duty upon tonnage, in particular, was originally and professedly imposed by the late Mr. Pitt, as a mere temporary war tax, in order to pay for the expenses of convoys. The ship-owners had therefore felt themselves aggrieved, when they found this war tax was to be continued after the conclusion of peace. For his own part, he approved of the system of our navigation laws, to which we were indebted for much our naval superiority; and he considered it therefore unwise to submit to a relaxation of that system. He denied what had fallen from the noble lord (Grenville), that the opposition to the late ministers' measures respecting the Roman catholics had arisen from clamour; on the contrary, he believed this opposition to be the result of sound good sense; and that a great majority of the people of this country had disapproved of the measures adopted, and in contemplation, by that noble lord and his colleagues, for making farther and farther concessions to the Roman catholics.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>declared that he had never heard within the walls of that house an assertion which tended more to sap the foundation of the credit of the country, than that which had just been made, by the noble secretary of state. Was it an assertion to be gravely listened to at this period of the world, and under the present momentous circumstances, that the public should not give credit to the resolutions of the house of commons until the assent of the house of lords had been obtained? Was this the rule of conduct that was observed by Mr. Pitt, on his negotiation for a loan with the house of Boyd and Co.? Did not parliament then think that they were in some measure bound even by the pledge of the minister? And
<col>528</col>
could noble lords who had come into office, at least under an implied pledge, could they be the first to recommend the breach of a pledge which had been made by his majesty's ministers? There was another circumstance to which he begged the attention of their lordships; some allusion had been made to the excitement of popular clamour; but he would ask the house, in what part of the country that clamour was most excited? Let noble lords look to Northampton; let them look to the election advertisement of the chancellor of the exchequer, and let them then say whether, at the time of the riots in the year 1780, more diligence or more zeal was then used by lord George Gordon to excite popular clamour, than had been made, use of on the occasion to which he alluded. He considered, in fact, that the act that gave sanction to such an outcry, without daring to avow its object, was most highly culpable. If, on the other hand, the circumstances which occasioned the late ministers to go out of office, were taken fully and seriously into consideration, he was firmly convinced that every liberal-minded man would most unequivocally declare that those facts were most highly honourable to his majesty's late ministers. For the part of the country with which he was most particularly connected he could answer (and they were a thinking set of people), that the great majority of them applauded the liberality of intention, and the firm and dignified constitutional conduct of his majesty's late ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Buckinghamshire</member> <membercontribution>felt it necessary to make an observation on the allusion that had been made respecting the conduct of a noble friend of his whilst lord lieutenant of Ireland, under whom he had acted at that time. It was true that his noble friend, in his speech to the Irish parliament, recommended the granting of certain privileges to the catholics; but these privileges were not intended to be extended farther, than was specified in the bill afterwards passed. Beyond this act, passed in 1793, it was not intended to go one single step.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>remarked, that he was sorry to notice a difference between the present statement of the noble earl, and the speech which his noble friend had delivered from the throne in Ireland. In that speech it was stated, that the advantages given to the catholics of Ireland would be extended to Great Britain. This, therefore, was a promise beyond that act.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Buckinghamshire </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, said, his meaning was, that no greater
<image src="S1V0009P0I0280"/>
<col>529</col>
privileges than those contained in the act of 1793, should be extended to any of the catholics.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Spencer</member> <membercontribution>felt it incumbent on him to contradict the assertion of a noble lord on the other side, who stated, that no measures had been resorted to by the present ministers to influence the public mind, on pretence of supporting the protestant religion. He could assure the house, from personal knowledge of the fact, that, in the town of Northampton, at the late election, the most inflammatory hand-bills, tending to excite the most dangerous riots in that town, had been universally circulated, which began with the words "Popery! or no Popery!" He never witnessed a more barefaced attempt to create disturbances; and the attempt had the desired effect; for the ignorant and illiterate people, having their prejudices and passions once put into motion, knew not where to stop; and this town, which only a few months before had been remarkable for the tranquillity and good order that prevailed in it, was now one continued scene of contention; and private families, who had long associated with each other in the utmost harmony and friendship, were now thrown into a state of party hostility and rancour. He could state several other facts upon this subject; but as he supposed the merits of the late and present administration would be discussed on some future occasion, he should, until then, reserve what he had to say.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>contended that tile conversation was, perfectly regular, as on a money bill it was always permitted to discuss general topics. The financial system of his noble friend, was a grand feature in the history of the country. If the ministers chose to raise an unfounded clamour among the mob, it was in parliament that they would stand and justify themselves; and this bill afforded the opportunity. It was relevant also to enter upon general topics, as the amendment, it would appear from what had been stated by the noble lord on the other side, was only the harbinger to the total destruction of the system. Though he, and those with whom he acted, had differed from his noble friend (Grenville) on some important points, they had not attempted, when in opposition, to take advantage of the mistaken feelings of the mob. He remembered, when the country was in a calamitous situation, when the scarcity had disposed people to acts of violence What would have been the situation of the
<col>530</col>
country if they had then encouraged the cry against forestallers and regraters, as the present ministers had stirred up and inflamed the cry of no popery? The whole country might have been thrown into the utmost confusion. But though ministers had raised that senseless clamour out of doors, he was glad to perceive that they had not dared to attempt it in that house. With regard to the catholic bill, many of the present ministers had agreed to go further in favour of the catholics; the only red ground of objection to the bill therefore seemed to be this, that the late ministers were not willing that the protestant dissenters should be in a worse situation than the Roman catholics. As far, therefore, as the cry of "no popery" was concerned, nobody surely could accuse them of being enemies to the protestant establishment, who had not proposed to go so great a length in favour of the catholics, as had been done by many of the present ministers. He wished a noble person had been present under whose administration proposals had been made to the officers of the Irish brigade to enter our service, promising them the same rank as the English officers, except the appointments on the staff. He maintained that the cry of "no popery" had been raised and encouraged by persons in high situations, and even by protestant clergymen, whose religion might have taught them more liberality. And yet ministers said that the whole was the effect of popular feeling left to itself! They then boasted of having the people with them, but they certainly were not the sensible part of them. But when they talked of the mob, they ought to recollect that nearly a third part of the population of the empire were catholics. And one of the great mischiefs with which this conduct was attended was, that it separated the British, from the Irish populace. If such a storm as this was raised; if you held out the principle that the protestants and catholics could so little coalesce, that they could not serve together in your fleets and armies, it would be in reality a disunion between England and Ireland, and one which no legislative measure could remove. To produce this disunion, however, was certainly the tendency of the conduct of ministers. The noble lord then came to the clamour about the shipping interest, which was followed up with the same spirit as the clamour of no popery. The assertions on the other side would go to maintain that the late ministers were enemies not only to the shipping interest, but even
<image src="S1V0009P0I0281"/>
<col>531</col>
to the fleets of the nation. He contended, however, that the late ministers were the true friends of the navy, by encouraging all those interests which formed its foundation, instead of favouring, in a particular and partial manner, the shipping interest, which formed but a very small part of them. But the clamours of ministers might perhaps be intended, in some measure, for electioneering purposes. When some person talked to Wilkes about taking the sense of his constituents, Wilkes replied, that he would give him all the sense of his constituents, if he would give him (Wilkes) all their nonsense. Ministers were, therefore, perhaps, applying to the nonsense of the people; but while these things were going on, it became the house to consider the situation in which the country stood. Notwithstanding the superiority over the other countries of Europe with which we were disposed to flatter ourselves, he could safely affirm that there was no country in Europe, catholic or protestant, that was not astonished at our conduct in not availing ourselves of our catholic population. Our navy had increased, not in consequence of the restrictions imposed, but in spite of them, and because, on the whole, we had fewer restrictions than what had prevailed in other countries.&#x2014;Then we had the opinion of ministers as to the new system of finance. Their objection to it was, that it was too vast, and embraced too great a number of years. But, however, they had acted on this plan for this year, which they were under no necessity of doing if it was a bad one, since so many better plans, in their opinion, had been proposed by some of themselves. If the plan was a bad one, it ought not to be continued for a year, if it was a wise one, then its embracing a number of years, in the manner actually done, was no objection. The amendment must have been introduced for one of two objects, either to overthrow the plan, or to gratify the ship-owners. If the latter was the object, why did they not for this purpose repeal the late West India act? This was in fact governed by the same principles as the rest of their conduct. The object was to secure popular clamour in their favour by any means. In the present situation of the country it was the duty of every member of parliament to watch the conduct of a government of this description with the utmost jealousy and distrust. After they had got into the 'elysian fields,' as it had been called, he thought they might have abandoned such conduct. But they still per
<col>532</col>
sisted and were the only persons who had employed, in an open and undisguised manner, a threat of dissolution to influence a decision of the house of commons. He could not avoid saying, that considering the situation in which the country stood, it was unfortunate, indeed, that the affairs of the nation should be in such hands.&#x2014;The bill was then committed, and ordered to be reported the next day.</membercontribution></p>

John Foster, who had accepted the office of chancellor of the exchequer for Ireland.&#x2014;Mr. Bankes moved, that there be laid before the house an account of the regulations established in the British Museum since February, 1805, for the preservation of the collection, and for the more free and easy access of the public; and also an account of the numbers admitted from the 9th of February, 1805, to the present time, specifying the numbers in each month of that period.

The Secretary at War said, that the object of the bill was highly proper, that he entirely approved of it, and would contribute every thing in his power to carry it into effect. The bill was then read a first time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[CALICO PRINTERS' BILL.]&#x2014;Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>moved the second reading of the Journeymen Calico Printers' Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Robert Peele</member> <membercontribution>said, that although, on account of his ill health, he had been given leave to absent himself from his duty in parliament, yet he should feel great self-reproach, if he should allow a bill so mischievous as he conceived this to be, to pass, without giving it his decided opposition. He was himself a friend to the Journeymen Calico Printers, and he conceived that he and the other Master-Printers had done them more service than they would ever receive from the speeches of the right hon. gent. (Mr. Sheridan). The Journeymen in their first demand of limiting the number of apprentices, seemed to act upon the principle, that they were able by combination to give
<image src="S1V0009P0I0282"/>
<col>533</col>
the law to the masters. This scheme, however failed, and only occasioned the masters to bring many new hands into the trade. Then were many masters who seriously though of removing themselves and their capitals to some other country, where their property would be better protected, and their trade be more free from restriction; for a man of property could never bear the idea of receiving the law, in every instance, from his journeymen. If it could be proved that this bill would be for the advantage of the journeymen, he should not oppose it, as he considered that the interests of the greater number should be attended to in preference to the interests of the few; but he was convinced, that a bill like the present would be injurious to the whole trade, and consequently to the journeymen. He concluded by moving, that it be read a second time on this day three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. D. Giddy</member> <membercontribution>supported this motion. He considered that in the present state of society, it was not so much the tyranny of kings and great men that was to be apprehended, as the tyranny of the many over the few. He considered that nothing was more dangerous than combinations among journeymen. If the agricultural labourers were to combine in a similar manner, and demand for their labour more than their fair proportion of the land, the country must rapidly fall to ruin.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Jacob</member> <membercontribution>began by observing, that in 1791, this country only exported to the value of one million annually in cotton goods; but, now, in sixteen years after that period, the quantity exported amounted to 9,750,000l., being more than one third of the whole amount of our exports. This great increase was owing to the skill and talents of the Calico Printers. In the infancy of this trade, some degree of philosophy was necessary, and a considerable knowledge of chemistry; but now, by the division of labour, the business of a calico printer did not require more skill than any other handicraft trade, and therefore the present race of calico printers were not entitled to better wages than most other mechanics. It was allowed, that a boy of 14 could, in a few months, learn the whole business, and yet the average wages were 25s. a week, although the workmen lived for the most part in the Northern counties, where those wages would go much farther than they would in a Southern county. He did not see that the Journeymen Calico printers had any serious subject of complaint, and therefore he should oppose the present bill.</membercontribution></p>
<col>534</col>
<p><member>Mr. P. Moore</member> <membercontribution>declared that the anxious wish of the committee was, that the masters and journeymen should regulate the matter among themselves, without bringing it before parliament. The complaint of the journeymen was this; that a large number of loyal, dutiful, and faithful subjects were now without employment and without bread, in consequence of the grievances of which they complained. He conceived it the first duty of government to see that the subjects of the realm had bread. He felt a good deal for the rights of journeymen; his constituents were either journeymen, or had been journeymen, and he had, therefore, considered that kind of right which was derived from having served an apprenticeship. He considered, that from the system of apprenticeships was derived, not only the superior skill of our workmen in every department, but a great part of the practical morality of the British nation. He admitted, that on account of the division of labour, a boy could be taught to do the business in a very short time, as well as a journeyman. The consequence was, that as soon as the boy was out of his apprenticeship he also found himself out of bread. It was therefore in this branch of trade, more than in any other, that some regulations were wanting to insure a subsistence to the journeymen.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Henry</member> <membercontribution>Erskine considered, that whatever might be the grievances of the journeymen, the present bill would not afford the remedy. It was against the first principles of civil liberty, as well as against all the commercial maxims which had hitherto been received. The first clause of it was to prevent masters from taking more than a certain number of apprentices. This was a regulation, which had never before been demanded from parliament. Every man had an undoubted right to teach his trade to as many people as he chose. He thought the cry against the numbers coming into the trade was as ridiculous as if he or others, old journeymen in the profession of the law, should come to parliament to complain of the number of young men of talents that were educating for that profession, and beg that the house would shut the door against them, for fear they should interfere with the old practitioners. As to the wages given he thought that that, as well as the price of the article, would of themselves find their level. He therefore was decidedly in opposition to the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>defended the bill. He said it would have been well if his hon. and learned friend (Mr. H.Erskine) had con-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0283"/>
<col>535</col>
descended to read the report of the commitee upon which this bill was founded, before he exercised so much of his ingenuity in condemning it. If he had read that report, he would have found, that, so far from being a measure for the encouragement of combinations amongst the journeymen calico-printers, it was one for the relief and protection of the industrious and oppressed. His hon. and learned friend had declared, that, whatever was the, nature of the disorder complained of, he would not give this bill as a cure, because he considered it absolute poison. But he (Mr. S.) believed it was the practice of all regular bred physicians to consult a. little the nature of the disorder, before they rejected one remedy to prescribe another; and, in this case, he certainly felt that he had the advantage of his hon. and learned friend. He intreated, however, that the house, before it should reject the present bill, would first condescend to read the report of its committee, which it was always customary for the house to respect, and not to libel or stultify that report, without ever once reading or considering the evidence upon which it was founded. Before the house consented to reject this bill, he begged they would consider, that the necessary consequence must be inconsistency with their own justice, to repeal the act of the 5th of Elizabeth, by which every other trade in the kingdom, except that of the calico-printers was regulated, and protected. But before that house would agree to such a repeal, he was sure they would pause very deliberately, and consult their own reflections upon the necessary consequences to the manufactures of the country. What was the case of the complainants in this instance? For a series of successive years had they been mendicant suppliants at the bar of that house, offering petition after petition, praying relief but in vain. The moment, however, they found their petition entertained, and felt any ground of hope that their grievances would be fairly considered, all combination ceased and their reliance for redress was entirely founded upon the justice and liberality of parliament. What was their complaint? Why, that after having served seven years to a business confessedly injurious to their health, and which rendered them unfit for any other occupation, they were to be turned loose upon the world, supplanted in their employments by whole legions of apprentices, at 12 or 14 years of age, for the wages of 4s., 6s., or 8s. per week, instead of 25s., the usual average of the jour<ob/>neyman, by
<col>536</col>
whose previous skill and ingenuity the operations of the manufacture were so amplified that children could do the work as well as, journeymen. And what was the alternative proposed to those unfortunate men? To be satisfied with the average wages of 9s. per week, usually paid to common daily labourers throughout their districts, or left to become soldiers or sailors, occupations for which their state of body, after devoting 7 years to an unwholesome business, rendered them totally unfit. Would the house consent to a proposition so monstrous, as that those young men, after having devoted 7 years to learn a trade, to the ruin of their health, by which their industry had, so eminently contributed to the wealth of their masters and their country, should be deprived of all employment, and be turned loose upon society, as burthens to the charity, or freebooters upon the property of their neighbourhood? He never was a proselyte to the doctrines of Adam Smith upon this subject. It was the wisest policy of a nation to provide employment for the matured vigour of its population; and those manfacturers, who derived immense fortunes by the early industry of those journeymen, would ill deserve the encouragement of the legislature and of the state, if they were ready to sacrifice the comforts of their men to their own avarice, and consign them to beggary the moment they became entitled to receive the wages of journeymen. He instanced one particular house, which entertained above 50 apprentices, and only 2 journeymen; and he begged to ask how many thousands of artisans must be devoted to famine, if this system was to become general. His hon. and learned friend had compared the state of the bar to that of the calico-printers, and said, what might be very true, that many of the members of that learned profession were much distressed. It might be so, and was to be lamented. But, if it were possible, by the operations of that machinery, philosophy, or chemistry, which had been so learnedly spoken of that night, so to simplify the business of the bar, as to render it practicable to little boys and girls at 12 or 14, he believed there would be more clamour from the gentlemen of the long robe in Westminster Hall, than from all the combining manufacturers of Lancashire put together. The right hon. gent. mentioned some other instances of oppression from the masters to their apprentices, and their illegal modes of securing their services, sometimes for 9 or 10 years, by a
<image src="S1V0009P0I0284"/>
<col>537</col>
bond from the parent instead of a stamped indenture. He concluded by supporting the bill, and declaring, at the same time, that he disclaimed all countenance to combination; that he should belie the uniform tenor of his whole political life, if, while he had a seat in that house, the cause of the weak should want an advocate against the strong, who revelled in wealth and luxury upon the fruits of their hard industry.</membercontribution></p>

The hon. bart. stated, that in consequence of due notice, not having been given in a recent case, the sitting member was at the expense of bringing several witnesses from a distance of no less than 400 miles, and was proceeding to remark upon the probability and injustice of many similar instances, when the Speaker stopped him, by stating the irregularity of offering more on this occasion than a mere statement of the motion he meant to bring forward.&#x2014;Mr. Vausittart appeared at the bar, and read the report of the committee upon the Shrewsbury election. This report stated, that the hon. H. G. Bennet was not duly qualified according to law, and therefore that he ought not to have been elected; that the petitions against him from Mr. T. Jones and others, and the defence made against them, were not frivolous or vexatious; and that the election, so far as regarded the said H. G. Bennet, was void. After the report was delivered in at the table, a new writ was ordered for the election of a representative for Shrewsbury, in the room of Mr. Bennet.&#x2014;Mr. Horner gave notice of a motion for Wednesday, for the production of papers relative to the Polygar war, adding, that be should bring this motion forward, after the business with regard to the Carnatic, which an hon. baronet (sir T. Turton) had announced his intention to bring forward, should be disposed of.&#x2014; Sir Francis said, that he meant in the course of next week, upon a day, which, early in the week,
<col>538</col>
he should take occasion to mention, to bring forward a motion for the production of all the papers and information received by government or the India company, with respect to the late transactions at Vellore, or the probable consequences of those transactions. At the same time, the hon. member seeing the chancellor of the exchequer in his place, took occasion to ask, whether it was intended on the part of ministers, to propose, or to support any grant to the India company from the public money, by loan or otherwise, in the course of the present session: and if so, whether it was meant that such grant should be made before the statement of the general concerns of India (the India budget) should be laid before the house. The chancellor of the exchequer, in reply, stated, that government did not entertain the intention to which his question referred.</member></p>
<p><member>[POOR LAWS BILL.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for the recommitment of the first of the four bills, into which, at the suggestion of the house, he had divided his general bill. The bill now to be committed, was that for establishing a Plan for the Education of the Poor. The order of the day being read, and the question being put that the Speaker do now leave the chair, Mr. Whitbread rose to state the nature and object of this bill. It was not meant, he said, to supersede any parish schools for the education of the poor, already established; it was not meant to increase unnecessarily the, charge upon any district, where parish schools were already instituted for the education of the poor, by establishing therein additional schools; his object was, that in every parish where there was a number of poor who could not afford to pay for the education of their children, there should be a school established for their instruction. But, as he proposed the education of the poor to be the incipient principle and grand foundation of all the benefits to be derived in future from the measures of reform in the Poor Laws, he thought this bill, which went peculiarly to that object, should be first established. If, therefore any hon. member had any objections to the principle of the bill, this was the proper time to state them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ellison</member> <membercontribution>said, that, upon the first introduction of these bills, he had, in compliance with the hon. gent.'s injunction, forborne to enter into any discussion on the merits of the plan, understanding that it was first to go forth in the shape of a proposition to the country at large, and that time would be given to gentlemen throughout
<image src="S1V0009P0I0285"/>
<col>539</col>
the kingdom fully to consider and digest, the subject, before it was finally passed into law. He hoped still this would be the case; for it was impossible that a measure, which required so much mature consideration, and so materially interested the country at large, could, on so short a notice as the house had received, be so fully communicated to the whole kingdom, as it could be in a printed form. He therefore hoped that this bill, and the others, would not now be pushed forward into the shape of a law; but that, after such amendments as the committee should think proper to introduce, the bills should be printed, and time given till next session for gentlemen to turn the subject in their minds, to consult their constituents, and to come forward fully prepared to discuss the merits of the bills, and render them as complete as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>was of the same opinion; but although he thought the hon. member who brought forward this subject entitled to the thanks of the country, yet he had his doubts, whether educating the lower orders of the people, upon the principle laid down in this bill, would have the effect either of ameliorating their condition in the degree which seemed to be hoped, or of alleviating the burthens of the poor's rates, by that means, within such a period as should in any degree convince the country of any benefit to be derived from a measure which, for a considerable time, must go to increase those burthens. The bill proposed, that the poor children of each parish should be entitled to two years education between the age of 7 and 14: the consequences naturally would be, that the earlier part of this period would be chosen by the parents, as that in their children's labour would be the least profitable to them. Now, the advantages to be derived to the minds and morals of children in that class of life, from two years of education at that early part of life, did not appear to him so very considerable as the hon. gent. professed to expect; and to carry the system of education to the labouring poor still higher, would, he feared, tend rather to raise their minds above their lot in life, and by no means strengthen their attachments to those laborious pursuits, by which they were to earn a livelihood; pursuits to which, at present, there existed; throughout the poor of this country, a very strong reluctance. If, therefore, care was not taken to blend with their education early habits of industry, he feared that schooling would rather injure than serve them, in
<col>540</col>
the result. The subject of the Poor Laws had occupied, for a series of years, much of his own earnest attention; and of all the plans that occurred to him on the subject of education, the most feasible was, that of establishing schools in the maritime counties of this kingdom, and to which parents from the interior parts might send their children. At those schools, in addition to other instruction, they might be initiated in a naval education, and practised in fishing. They might thus draw, from the surrounding ocean, a great part of the means for their own maintenance. All British shipping, employed coast-ways, or sailing outward from the several ports in each district, might be obliged to take four, five, or more of those boys, at a proper age, and initiate them in naval service. At all events, they might be maintained and educated at one halt the expence of &#x00A3;14, now the usual average expence of each boy at charity schools. Eighty thousand boys might be thus kept in the continual progress of useful instruction, and acquire the opportunity of gaining a livelihood by maritime pursuits, affording thus an inexhaustible source of supply to the British navy. Nor was there ever a time when such a resource was more necessary than the present to the public security. But to prove the truth of the adage, that "there was nothing new under the sun," after he had for years considered this plan, he accidentally met with a tract, printed some years before, which exactly proposed the plan he had been considering as originally his own, and of the utility and importance of which he felt the fullest conviction.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>observed, that as the hon. gent. had thought fit to divide his original bill into four bills, this shewed that he had not at first fully considered the subject of the poor laws in all its bearings; he could therefore wish that the subject should be deferred to another session, when the bill might be introduced <i>de novo</i>, with the benefit of all the improvements which might in the meanwhile be suggested. As far as the principle of the bill went to increase the comforts of the poor, he sincerely wished that object might be obtained; but it behoved parliament to endeavour to give the poor virtue and morals, as well as instruction; and he also wished, that some general principle should be adopted, that rewards as well as punishments might follow; nor did he approve of taxing parishes, in addition to the heavy poor's rates, for the education of their children.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0286"/>
<col>541</col>
<p><member>Mr. Buller</member> <membercontribution>supported the bill, and instanced the happy effects of parochial education upon the population of Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Roscoe</member> <membercontribution>thought the improvement of the lower classes an object highly desirable as nothing could be more disgraceful than to leave them in a state of ignorance. The only distinction between this country and a savage nation arose out of knowledge, and of course the diffusion of that blessing must operate to advance our superiority. He contended that the alleviation of the poor s-rates must follow as a natural consequence of the measure before the house. For the uneducated man, having nothing but his bodily strength to depend upon, became of necessity a burthen upon the parish when that strength was gone; whereas the man of education, in consequence of the wider range which his mind naturally took, could find other resources to maintain himself when he could derive no support from his mere animal powers. Thus he conceived that education must tend to diminish the amount of the poor's-rate. In support of this opinion, the hon. member quoted the good effects of national education in Scotland which had progressively improved for a series of years, and in which, before the system proposed by this bill was introduced, these were no less than 200,000 beggars, who not only formed a burthen upon the public, but a most mischievous example with regard to morality, industry and law. But the most important end of national education, the hon. member conceived to be that which appeared in a Letter from Mr. Malthus to the hon mover of the bill, namely, as the learned writer stated, that "as the first object was to elevate the general character of the poor, this or any measure which tended to it was entitled to support." After such an opinion, from such a quarter, he thought that no Sound objection could be made to this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Calcraft</member> <membercontribution>was friendly to the principle of the bill, and was for carrying it into effect as speedily as possible. He thought also, that industry ought to be combined with knowledge. It was the advantage of the plan which was called Mr. Lancaster's, but Which was really discovered by Dr. Bell, rector of Swanage, that it afforded, in the rapidity With which it conveyed learning, full time for industry. But though he was Most anxious to have this part of the plan carried into effect, he feared it would hardly be received with satisfaction in the country,
<col>542</col>
unless it should be accompanied with a relief from some part of the burthens of the poor's rates. The execution of this measure was, besides, to lie not in the best hands. He allowed the clergymen of the parishes were the fittest men to superintend the execution of measures of this kind. But the parish officers were associated with the clergymen; and, from the little time these men could devote to their public functions, abuses would, attend the execution of this plan, as well as the other duties intrusted to these officers. On these grounds, he wished this part of the plan to be postponed, till the whole system should have been passed in the form that parliament should think proper to give it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Henry Erskine</member> <membercontribution>found it impossible for him to give a silent vote upon the subject. He could not help hailing this bill as a measure auspicious in the highest degree to the industry, the morality, the happiness, and good order of the people of this country. He was happy to give an example of the practical effect of education in the country from which he came (Scotland). It was to that that he attributed the total exemption of Scotland from the heavy burden of the poor laws, which oppress so much the middling classes of society in this country. It was education which gave the poor of Scotland too much pride and spirit to apply for parochial relief in their own country; and it was education which enabled them to distinguish themselves so much in every line when they left it. As to the emigrations from Scotland, they were generally supposed to proceed from the barrenness of the country, and from the principle of the proverb, "need makes the old wife trot;" but he considered that it rather proceeded from their talents being cultivated by education, and their having, in this respect, an advantage over the people of most nations to which they emigrated. Scotland was, to be sure, a barren country, and yet there were no people on earth more distinguished in horticulture. Scotch gardeners were to be found every where through England and Wales, and it was not only in this art that his countrymen excelled, but in such a variety of arts and sciences, that unless the house were to attribute it entirely to the <i>ingenium Scotorum,</i> they must allow that those advantages had been derived by the diffusion of education, and therefore they might expect the same results from an equal diffusion of it in this country. The Scotch had also learnt the virtue of frugality from education, as it gave thorn all that pride that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0287"/>
<col>543</col>
was necessary to maintain themselves in independence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Davies Giddy</member> <membercontribution>mentioned, that in the part of England that he lived in, (Cornwall), education was pretty generally diffused; at least so much of it, that almost every person there had learned reading, writing, and something of arithmetic. He thought it was easy to persuade parents, that it was to their advantage that their children should be brought up in the habits of industry. He thought that education would not be the better for being made compulsory; it Was better that it should be voluntarily, and not be forced; that "it should descend like the gentle dew of Heaven," and be received as a general blessing. He did not think it Would be easy to induce parents to consent to any forced system of education for their children.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Spencer Stanhope</member> <membercontribution>did not think the opinion of the Country yet fully collected on this measure. His opinion was, shortly, that the expence of the plan was certain, and the benefit very uncertain. Schoolmasters. and schoolmistresses were very difficult to be got. The value of learning had risen less than any thing else, in proportion to the depreciation of money; and, therefore, the number of persons competent to be schoolmasters and schoolmistresses was much diminished. He thought that if the schoolmasters could be got, it was doubtful whether the scholars could. The poor were anxious to make profit of the labour of their children as soon as possible. He gave the hon. gent. every credit for his praiseworthy exertions, though he saw these impediments in the way of his plan.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sharpe</member> <membercontribution>did not see how any of the objections that had been made affected the principle of the bill. All of them went to delay, though no good reason was assigned for this delay. He wished to shew the country, that the house could suspend its political and party contests, in order to join with common accord in matters of avowed public utility. The poor children would at all events be educated. The only question was, whether they should be well or ill educated? It was not in the school, nor under public or private masters alone, that education could be had. Children, if left alone, would educate themselves. But he who educated himself generally had a fool for his master. He did not think it possible that education could give sentiments above the condition of the individuals. Education would give habits of industry and attention. He wished for more
<col>544</col>
than two years of instruction; but even in this short period the children, though they should forget all their learning, would have collected many beneficial habits of an indelible nature; habits of submission and respect for their superiors; habits of cleanliness and exertion, and the fear of punishment. He thought the measure should be carried into effect without delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Porchester</member> <membercontribution>adverted to the reference that had been made to the difference between the education of the people in the northern and those in the southern part of Great Britain; and declared it to be his belief that, if it were not for the introduction of the Scots into England, there would be a great vacuum in many stations of society in this part of the island. That their steady, industrious, and thinking habit was attributable to their different mode of education, he thought was extremely probable. But, as to the idea of engrafting a system of national industry on a system of national education, that was in his opinion extremely chimerical. Instead of doing any thing of that sort, which might tend to render the bill intricate and oppressive, he should give his vote for the house now resolving itself into the committee on the bill which was now before them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>thought there was no need of going to the North for illustrations, nor to say much to that house upon the value of education. He thought it desirable that every one should be taught to read, but did not see the necessity of teaching every one to write: he disapproved of an addition of one shilling in the pound on the poor rates, which would be the effect of this bill, laid on for the prospect, at some years hence, afforded to some poor educated person of raising himself from his situation. He contended it was by no Means to be admitted that, because Scotland, in 1698, had received an establishment of schools, and had profited by it, that, therefore England, in her present civilized state, in 1807, should adopt similar regulations. He had taken great pains to examine the state of the poor, and should particularly speak of the town he represented (Reading), which contained 10,000 inhabitants, of whom 7,500 were poor; but hardly a child of ten years old was to be found who had not learned to read, at some of the threepenny schools which are kept by the poor old people. He saw no necessity for writing or arithmetic. He knew of no deficiency in the number of candidates for bankers clerks, and such situations, He
<image src="S1V0009P0I0288"/>
<col>545</col>
condemned the mode in which the bill was to be carried into effect, but praised highly the Sunday schools, which he regretted he found great difficulty in prevailing upon the poor people to attend. He censured the Conduct of those in the higher classes of society, who thought the poor should receive no education, but felt his objections to the present plan to be radical and fundamental. His opinions resulted from experience, and not from speculation and theory.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. George Vansittart</member> <membercontribution>was of opinion, that the establishment of parochial schools in the manner proposed by the bill was much too expensive. He did not think at first, that the occupiers of lands and houses should be taxed, in order that all the children in the country should be taught to read and write, especially when it was doubtful, whether writing would be of any real use. However, However, he would vote for the bill going into the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bragge Bathurst </member>, <membercontribution>though he could not but admit that the principle of diffusing instruction among the lower classes was good, could not say that he approved of this bill. He had received a communication from the part of the country with which he was connected, that the whole of the bill of the hon. gent. was disapproved of at the quarter sessions, as extremely burthensome, without any adequate advantage. One of his objections to this bill was, that it tended to give an education to the lower classes above their condition, and comprehended objects too great for any one measure. The hon. mover of the bill had not yet made any statement of the present means of educating the lower classes. If his bill were to pass, there would be no compulsion to force attendance at the schools, and consequently the first menace of wholesome discipline, would put an end to the attendance of the individual threatened. He also objected to this bill, because it would do away Sunday schools, to which no person would subscribe, when the parochial schools should be established.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>said, that he thought the house and the country were under great obligations to the hon. gent. who had introduced this measure, as it must have required much exertion and attention to make out four such bills as those before them; but at the same time he could not help thinking, that parliament ought to proceed with great caution upon such a subject. They were now undertaking, for the first time, a great work, which had been too long delayed, the diffusion of the benefits of education; and
<col>546</col>
therefore they ought to take care lest it might not prove prejudicial in some respects, while it was advantageous in others. He could easily conceive many modifications which such a bill might undergo, and amongst others, the combining of voluntary contributions, according to the different circumstances of places, and the means of instruction which each might possess; and, therefore, he approved of the house going into a committee. The encouraging a desire in the lower orders of the people to better their situation, did not appear to him an objectionable part of the bill; because, it was natural that hope should exist in the breast of every one, to push himself forward in the scale of human beings, As far, however, as he had been able to observe the disposition of the country, as to this bill, it had not been received so favourably as he could have wished. He himself had received various representations against it, principally on account of its having been precipitately introduced. Although he was for going into the committee, he was not for pressing it forward afterwards till such time as parliament could be informed more particularly of the real sentiments of the country regarding it. He agreed in regard to what had been said of Scotland, and ascribed a good deal of that order and moral conduct, industry, and rectitude, which prevailed in that part of the country, to their general system of education. It would be important that the system now to be adopted here, should be combined with all those advantages which made men valuable members of society, and accustomed them to be obedient under command and controul. He approved highly of the plan which had been suggested that night by a right. hon. gent. (Mr. Rose) as to combining it with the institution at maritime schools. He professed himself to be a friend to the bill in general, although he was convinced it was susceptible of various important improvements He trusted he should have to congratulate the hon. gent. who had introduced it, in having thus laid the foundation of a system which would yet be attended with the most beneficial effects upon society.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham </member>, <membercontribution>after paying some very handsome compliments to the hon. mover for his good intentions in the formation of the bill then before the house, observed, that this was a subject which most particularly required deliberate consideration. It was impossible, of all others, that this subject could be decided uno flatu. It was an
<image src="S1V0009P0I0289"/>
<col>547</col>
object that humanity and justice long required; but had the maturity of time now come to such a state of fulness that it was impossible for us to wait another session? That the diffusion of knowledge was proper might be supported by many good arguments; but he confessed that he was himself a sceptic on this point. It was said, look at the state of the savage when compared to ours. A savage among savages was very well, and the difference was only perceived when he came to be introduced into civilized society. That state of each society was known best by comparing one with another, and that was found to be the best which had the greatest variety of employments for its members. A knowledge of many of the fine arts, and of the mechanic arts, was very useful, but we were not all to be artists or mechanics; how awkward should we be situated if we were a nation of shoemakers, or carpenters, or taylors? If, on the other hand, all men were clerks, what should we do for labourers? This was a false idea; it was only giving the means of knowledge, without being certain that those means would be rightly made use of. His friend, Dr. Johnson, was of opinion that it was not right to teach reading beyond a certain extent in society. The danger was, that if the teachers of the good and the propagators of bad principles, were to be candidates for the controul of mankind, the latter would be likely to be too successful. He could not think it right to say, that every man who possessed intellect should administer to himself, because, if so, a patient who had intellect, and was of course most particularly interested in his own cure, would be the best doctor. The circulation of great truths would be of no advantage to mankind, unless you could increase the stature of their understanding, so as that it could reach those things. But great stress had been laid on the example of Scotland he admitted the full force of all the encomiums that had been paid to that country; but then it did not follow that he must consequently say, "all this comes of their writing and reading." He might as well say, like the old woman when she saw a man going to be hanged for forgery, "see what comes of your writing and reading." But there were particularities both in habit and appearance by which people of different countries might be distinguished from each other. If he was to see a man in a crowd, for instance, with red hair and high cheek bones, and
<col>548</col>
by his appearance knew that he was a Scotchman, was he to say, this is all owing, to their writing and reading in that part of the country? Would it nut be more rational to say, that in this, as well as in many other cases, it was difficult for him to trace causes from effects, as it was also to trace effects from any given causes; might he not say, that he did not know whether the prudence, economy, &amp;c. of the Scots was not the cause of their applying themselves more to learning than we did? A more substantial cause was, perhaps, found out by an hon. gent. opposite, who had attributed the economy of the Scots to the want of poor laws throughout the greater part of the country. But we should consider how far the measure itself was calculated to effect its own object; for instance, let us look to England, and see if learning had not increased rapidly for many years past, and yet, in the same proportion, we find that poverty had increased. The increase of this sort of introduction to knowledge would only tend to make the people study politics, and lay them open to the arts of designing men; it was impossible that a great quantity of reading in a country could banish poverty entirely out of the nation; we might as well say, that we could remove poverty from among a people by teaching them all to play the fiddle. A good deal, however, might be said to consist in the extent of the population and general habits of the people; and whilst people were found to lose sight of that honourable principle of independence that would not suffer them to rest their hopes of relief on the parish, it was impossible to prevent poverty among them. As long as men would marry, and get children, without ever thinking of what was to become of their offspring; as long as men would spend their gains as fast as they got them, living from hand to mouth, and not laying something by for a rainy day, according to their own emphatical expression, so long would it be impossible to hope that poverty should not creep in amongst us. The benefit societies contributed, indeed, as far as their general principle went, to remove the I danger of being overwhelmed with poverty more than any system which he had seen for many years; but even they might, in many instances, be liable to some objection, as to the detailed part of each particular society. The plan of his hon. friend, however, did not possess the least possible means of removing poverty from our door for an
<image src="S1V0009P0I0290"/>
<col>549</col>
instant, except in some few individual cases. He must, therefore, however reluctantly, oppose the motion of his hon. friend, whose humane and patriotic intentions must be fairly acknowledged and sincerely felt by every Englishman.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>contended against the principle laid down by his right hon. friend. Was it to be believed, that one of the most erudite men of his day, that an enlightened statesman of the nineteenth century, could stand forward in that house to argue against the universal diffusion of knowledge? That a man who was himself the shining example of the great and good effects resulting from education, could now be an advocate for ignorance? That the representative of a free people could say, that the people were the more free when they were the less enlightened? His right hon. friend had said, that persons the most interested in any business were generally the least qualified for that business; and had instanced such a position by one of those illustrations with which his right hon. friend more frequently amused than convinced the house. A patient, it had been said, was of all others the least capable of assisting himself. But what formed the grand distinction between brutes and human beings so circumstanced? The latter could point out the seat of their disease, and thus direct the skill of the physician; so that, to carry on the illustration, information was in a high degree essential to the patient. Much had been said respecting the increased burthens of the poor rates; he contended for it that the proposed system of education would considerably reduce those burthens. In Scotland, the poor rates were almost nothing. In Westmoreland, and other English counties, where education in a greater proportion prevailed, the rates were in the same proportion lessened. As to the application to France, he thought it made for his argument; for though those who were at the head of the Revolution might have been enlightened, was notorious that the instruments in the hands of those men were the most ignorant and brutal of the Parisian mob; but it was singular, to hear such an argument from one, who, in introducing to that house the military plan that did him so much honour, had observed that the Scots made the best soldiers, and why? because the Scots were in general the best educated. His right hon. friend then said, "give me a soldiery of exalted character." He, (Mr. Whitbread) now said, give me a
<col>550</col>
peasantry of exalted character. It was education only that gave such character to either. It had been said that the illiterate peasantry would see sufficiently by the lights of the community in which they lived. He, for his part, could not understand how a man would be enabled to see better by a candle held by others than by one held by himself. Education might be said to be the panacea, if any thing human could be a panacea, for the ills to which our state was naturally subjected. As to the red hair and high cheekbones of the Scots, these were but physical allusions, neither seriously introduced, nor to be seriously commented upon: but as to the moral distinctions; how were such to be ascertained? He believed by the frequency or scarcity of crime. In Westmoreland, the best educated county in England, executions were scarcely known. Search the Newgate calendar. The great majority of those executed in London every year were Irish; the next in order were English, and the last Scots. This was in exact proportion with their respective systems of education among the lower orders. Several gentlemen had objected to the great additional expense of which, it was apprehended, this plan of education might be productive. He contended that that expense had been considerably overrated. He had said that they would not in any case exceed one shilling in the pound, and then it was immediately concluded that the expenses were in all cases to be estimated at a shilling in the pound. The hon. gent. then took a view of the plan as affecting the metropolis. In the parish of St. Giles, no less than 5000 children, the offspring of the labouring Irish, were daily advancing in ignorance to maturity. Mr. Lancaster was likely to contribute still further to the service of his country, by assuming the management of a school in the Seven Dials for carrying on his approved system of mechanical education. He was willing to say, too, that he thought Dr. Bell's services in this way had been very important.&#x2014;He bad been advised to postpone the bill for another year. Human existence was uncertain. He might not live for another year, and he was unwilling that the measure should fall into the hands of any one who might be less enthusiastic in the prosecution of it than himself. He concluded by trusting that the house would allow the bill to go into a committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>expressed his readiness to concur in the motion for
<image src="S1V0009P0I0291"/>
<col>551</col>
the Speaker's leaving the chair, because he was convinced that the investigation of the subject in the committee would be productive of material advantage. He could not, however, agree with the hon. gent. in many of his positions; and he differed considerably from him in the hostility which he had expressed towards the whole code of the Poor Laws; a code which, in his opinion, contained a great deal of good, although, certainly, with some alloy of evil.&#x2014;The house then resolved itself into a committee, in which a conversation arose. Mr. Whitbread was anxious that the bill should be immediately proceeded with, reminding the house that it had lain on the table ever since the 22d of February. Mr. Giddy and Mr. Carey objected to any further proceeding with the bill at that late hour as many objections must necessarily arise against the various clauses. It was agreed, therefore, that the proceedings in the committee should be postponed, and the house having resumed, the chairman reported progress, and obtained leave to sit again on Monday.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>The Lord Chancellor </member>, <membercontribution>in his majesty's name, delivered the following speech:</membercontribution></p>
<p>"<member>My Lords and Gentlemen </member>, <membercontribution>We have it in command from his majesty to inform you, that his majesty has thought fit to avail himself of the first moment which would admit of an interruption of the sitting of parliament, without material inconvenience to the public business, to close the present session; and that his majesty has therefore been pleased to cause a commission to be issued under the great seal for proroguing the parliament.&#x2014; We are further commanded to state to you, that his majesty is anxious to recur to the sense of his people, while the events which have recently taken place are yet fresh in their recollection.&#x2014;His majesty feels, that in resorting to this measure, under the present circumstances, he at once demonstrates, in the most unequivocal manner, his own conscientious persuasion of the rectitude of those motives upon which he has acted, and affords to his people the best opportunity of testifying their determination to support him in every exercise of the prerogative of his crown, which is conformable to the sacred obligations under which they are held, and conducive to the welfare of his kingdom, and to the security of the constitution.&#x2014;His majesty directs us to express his entire conviction, that after so long a reign, marked by a series of indulgences to his Roman catholic subjects, they, in common with every other class of his people, must feel assured of his attachment to the principles of a just and enlightened toleration, and of his anxious desire to protect equally and promote impartially the happiness of all descriptions of his subjects."<lb/>
"Gentlemen of the House of Commons, His majesty has commanded us to thank you, in his majesty's name, for the supplies which you have furnished for the public service. He has seen, with great satisfaction, that you have been able to find the means of defraying, in the present year, those large but necessary expenses for which you have provided, without imposing upon his people the immediate burthen of additional taxes.&#x2014;His majesty has observed with no less satisfaction, the inquiries which you have instituted into subjects connected with public economy; and he trusts that the early attention of a new parliament, which he will forthwith direct
<image src="S1V0009P0I0292"/>
<col>553</col>
to be called, will be applied to the prosecution of these important objects."<lb/>
"My Lords and Gentlemen, His majesty has directed us most earnestly to recommend to you that you should cultivate, by all means in your power, a spirit of union, harmony, and good will amongst all classes and descriptions of his people. His majesty trusts that the divisions naturally and unavoidably excited by the late unfortunate and uncalled for agitation of a question so interesting to the feelings and opinions of his people, will speedily pass away; and that the prevailing sense and determination of all his subjects to exert their united efforts in the cause of their country, will enable his majesty to conduct to an honourable and secure termination the great contest in which he is engaged."&#x2014;After which</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>said, "My Lords and Gentlemen, By virtue of his majesty's commission under the great seal, to us and other lords directed, and now read, we do, in his majesty's name, and in obedience to his commands, prorogue this parliament to Wednesday, the 13th of May next, to be then here holden; and this parliament is accordingly prorogued to Wednesday, the 13th day of May next."</membercontribution></p>
