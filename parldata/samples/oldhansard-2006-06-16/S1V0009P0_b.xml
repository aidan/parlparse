<p><member>This being the day appointed for the meeting of the New Parliament, the Lord Chancellor came to the house at two o'clock, and being seated on the woolsack, immediately rose and said, "My lords, I have to acquaint you, that his majesty, not thinking fit to attend in person this day, has been pleased to issue a commission under the great seal, empowering certain commissioners, named therein, to open and hold this present parliament." The lords commissioners then present, namely, the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, the earl of Aylesford, and lord Hawkesbury, being robed, and having taken their seats in front of the throne, Mr. Quarme, the yeoman usher of the black rod, was deputed to order the attendance of the commons; a number of whom forth with appeared, preceded by the clerks of that house.&#x2014;The commission was then read, and the lord chancellor spoke as follows:&#x2014;"My lords, and gentlemen of the house of commons; We have it in command from his majesty, to let you know, that his majesty will, as soon as the members of both houses shall be sworn, declare to you the causes of his calling this parliament; and it being necessary that a Speaker of the house of commons should be first chosen, it is his majesty's pleasure, that you, gentlemen of the house of commons, repair to the place where you are to sit, and there proceed to the choice of some proper person to be your Speaker; and that you present such person here to-morrow, at three o'clock, for his majesty's royal appro-

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-06-22">Monday, June 22.</date>
<p><member>[CHOICE OF A SPEAKER]</member> <membercontribution>About two o'clock, the attendance of the commons, at the bar of the house of lords, was commanded in a message by the black rod. About 200 members, who had been previously, sworn in by the lord steward of the household, according to custom, in the Long Gallery, went up immediately, and having received his majesty's command, signified by the lord chancellor, to elect a Speaker, returned, and shortly after proceeded to the exercise of that privilege in the usual form.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Yorke rose </member>, <member>and addressing himself to Mr. Ley, the senior clerk, said, that the house was now called upon to exercise one of its most antient and valuable privileges, in electing, from among its members, a proper person to discharge the functions of its Speaker; functions always important to the maintenance of order and decorum within its own walls, and the execution of which was at the same time most essential, towards obtaining for the proceedings of the house, the respect and sanction of the community abroad. Some apology was perhaps necessary, for his presuming to offer himself to the house on this occasion, which implied an assumption, that the person whom he should recommend as the most fit and proper, to discharge the arduous duties annexed to the chair, should immediately appear to the house to possess in a pre-eminent degree
<image src="S1V0009P0I0298"/>
<col>567</col>
the assemblage of great qualities which was requisite for the office. He was aware, that there were many gentlemen in the house, who, by their abilities and conduct, and the authority annexed to their names and persons, were very capable of filling this important station with dignity and advantage. But there was something farther than mere personal qualifications which afforded not only a fair presumption, but even the assurance and full conviction, that the right hon. gent. he meant to propose was, even among the many other highly gifted persons whom he saw around him, the most worthy to fill the chair of the house in these times of difficulty. In addressing the house on this occasion, he had, in addition to the satisfaction of discharging a high public duty, a pride and pleasure in bearing his personal testimony to merits which he had long privately known, and which, the more he knew them, the more he esteemed and honoured, and the more he congratulated himself on his acquaintance with the person who possessed them in so eminent a degree. He anticipated, therefore, with peculiar satisfaction the testimony that he knew would be unanimously borne this day to every thing that he had said in behalf of his right hon. friend. It was a farther satisfaction to him, to think that the vote which the house would give on this occasion, would be distinct from all party prejudices and interests, the prevalence of which in that house, was on every occasion to be deplored; but the prevalence of which, at the present difficult and dangerous crisis, was particularly to be deprecated, as it might perhaps be pregnant with the ruin of these once flourishing, united, and happy countries. He was satisfied that, on the present occasion at least, no party feeling would find room among those he saw around him. This happy unanimity would enhance the pride and pleasure he felt on being permitted to address the house on this occasion; and he hailed the approaching unanimous election of his right hon. friend to the chair, as an omen of the future concord which he hoped to see prevail generally in the house. It was not necessary for him to descant on the qualifications requisite to fill the chair with propriety, as there were many gentlemen present who had repeatedly seen it filled in the most honourable manner. But, if he were called upon to give an instance of every thing that a Speaker of the house of commons ought to be, though the chair had, within his memory, been filled by many persons of very high and distin-
<col>568</col>
guished merit, he should not hesitate to name the right hon. Charles Abbot. (a general cry of hear! hear!) If he possessed more eloquence, he could with pleasure dwell on the merits by which this right hon. gent. was so eminently distinguished and recommended. He could dilate upon the independence of his character, his accurate knowledge of the laws of the country, his intimate acquaintance with the forms and the practice of the house of commons, and his love of the constitution. But all praise must fall short of the merits which the house knew so well, and estimated so highly. The services which Mr. Abbot had rendered as chairman of the committee of finance, and as chief secretary for Ireland, were, however, so deeply impressed upon his mind, that he could not restrain himself from making particular mention of them. As a member of the committee of finance he had had particular opportunities of observing the meritorious conduct of his right hon. friend as chairman of that committee; and he had also particular reason to know, how much cause Ireland had to regret his being called from his high station in that country, to fill the chair of that house. Mr. Abbot was, in one word, in every sense, one of the best servants of the public; and if every other servant of the public, at the present time, and in the times to come, performed his duty with the same fidelity, zeal, and diligence, the country would find in such service, the most effectual means of extricating itself from the difficulties with which it was now encompassed. He should trespass no farther on the house, but conclude with moving, That the right hon. Charles Abbot, be called to the chair of that house.</member></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bankes rose</member> <membercontribution>and addressed the house thus:&#x2014;Sir, I never rose with more satisfaction to second any motion than I now do that which has just been submitted to you; because I am sure I am speaking the unanimous sentiments of those I address, when I say, that I am persuaded nothing could conduce so much to the dignity of this house, and the general interests of the country, as the placing such a person as Mr. Abbot in that chair, which he has already repeatedly filled with so much honour. As I speak in the hearing of many of those members who formerly sat in this house, it may be thought, that, as to them, it is totally unnecessary to enlarge; but there are now many amongst us who had not formerly a seat here, and therefore I hope they will excuse me for telling them, that there is no
<image src="S1V0009P0I0299"/>
<col>569</col>
person who has exercised himself in the duties of that most important office, with more integrity, ability, candour, and fidelity, than the right. hon. gent. who has been nominated to their choice. He is a gentleman, who, to the most diligent research, adds the most profound knowledge of mankind, with great legal knowledge, extensive experience in history, and a great and accurate understanding in constitutional and parliamentary law. These are endowments which qualify him most abundantly to undertake that arduous and difficult situation to which we recommend him. The easy access which he gave to all who had occasion to consult him, is fresh in the recollection of many whom I address. To them, too, it is abundantly known, how usefully and honourably he filled the chair for several years. To myself it is a great gratification to feel, that in discharging what I conceive to be a great public duty, I am also obeying the call of a long and uninterrupted friendship. He was, sir, amongst the first of my friends in this world, and it is a great pleasure and satisfaction to me to find, in a great assembly of enlightened men, of great qualifications and parliamentary experience, that such a friend, whom I have known so long and so intimately, should be the person repeatedly deemed most fit to fill the situation of Speaker amongst us. I am sure that upon this occasion, as upon former ones, those who know his abilities, perseverance, and integrity, will again deem him most fit to resume it, and that those who have not known him so sufficiently as to have experienced his qualifications, will never have cause to regret their acquiescence in the opinion and choice of those who have. On these grounds I concur with my right hon. friend in every sentiment he has uttered, and beg leave to conclude with seconding the motion he has submitted to your consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cateraft.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Sir, I never rose with more pleasure in this house, than I now feel in rising to express my concurrence in this motion. I have witnessed, in common with many others now present, the great talents, the industry, and becoming conduct of that right hon. gent., whose character and qualifications are now the subjects of discussion. He has formerly filled that chair in such a manner, that I think I should not be doing justice to my own feelings, if I did not say, that I do not know of any one individual so well qualified to fill that dignified and honourable situation, as that right hon. gent. In saying thus much of him I
<col>570</col>
may perhaps by some be thought to be going too far with my eulogium, and I acknowledge they might think so with some degree of justice, were I to have formed this opinion merely upon the basis of those qualifications which have been touched upon by the mover and seconder of the motion. I do not mean to infer, that there may not be several men now present in this house, who, from their abilities, extensive knowledge, and experience, are perhaps equally adequate to the important and arduous task of filling that office: but, sir, under the present circumstances in which that right hon. gent. stands, and in the present situation of affairs, I think there are other considerations and other qualities which ought to enter into our consideration. I am convinced, I say, from this more comprehensive view of the subject, that the house could not make a more judicious choice than in electing that gentleman. I perfectly concur in every thing that has been stated concerning him. I approve of the detail Which the two hon. gentlemen have given of his character, While I do this, however, I must also be allowed to state, that from such qualifications alone does not arise the governing motive of my acquiescence. What more immediately tends to induce me to support this nomination, is that spirit of firmness and independence, with which he has always executed the high trust committed to him, and this, too, upon every occasion, but more particularly upon a memorable one, the circumstances of which are yet fresh in your recollection. The situation in which he was placed was, indeed, singular; but it was such as may occur again. I allude to a transaction which took place in this house, at a time when many who are now here were not present; an occasion, when, upon a division taking place, on the proposition of an hon. friend of mine (Mr. Whitbread), the numbers of the members on both sides of the question were equal. Such was the predicament in which that right hon. gent. was placed, when occupying that chair, to which we are now proposing to recal him; a predicament, in which he had a remarkable opportunity of exercising that firmness of mind which is so becoming in all situations of life, but particularly in that to which he had been called by the unanimous concurrence of this house. He gave, as it were, a form and body to the wishes of the people, by converting the propositions which were then submitted to us into resolutions of this house; I mean those resolution<ob/>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0300"/>
<col>571</col>
which preceded the impeachment of lord Melville. Sir, what induces me more particularly to allude to this fact is, the circumstance of my conviction, that this must be an inquiring parliament, otherwise we shall find that the people will be infinitely disappointed in the expectations they have formed of those they have sent to it as their representatives. Upon such grounds, therefore, I think, that the high trust and responsability of a Speaker of this house cannot be delegated into the hands of any man with greater propriety, or with greater safety, than into the hands of one, who has already executed that situation with firmness and independence. What he has already done, upon a former occasion, we surely have every reason to expect he would not hesitate to do upon a future occasion. The firmness, the impartiality, the spirited and dignified independence, which he has already shewn, should certainly induce us to believe that he would act so again, should another similar opportunity offer. This, therefore, is my governing principle for voting for the right hon. gent. If his conduct upon that day had been otherwise, I most unquestionably would have voted against him. I do not deny, but, on the contrary, I admit, that he possesses all the qualifications which have been enumerated; but I mean fairly and frankly to own, that this last one, which I have stated, is with me the chief inducement, the governing principle which actuates my vote in his favour. Lest it should be said that I am introducing party principles, and party prejudices, I shall abstain from making any further observations; but, while I give my most cordial assent to the motion now before you, I cannot conclude without observing, that if ever there was a parliament likely to create great warmth of discussion upon great political and party top<ob/>cs, it is the present parliament, which is now for the first day, assembled.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. William Smith</member> <membercontribution>gave his hearty concurrence to the motion, and had great satisfaction in seeing recalled to the chair a gentleman who had acquitted himself in such a manner in the public and private duties of the office, as to prove himself possessed of the best disposition as well as the most perfect ability to fill it in the most beneficial manner. The discharge of the public duties of the chair in the house was a matter that came under the observation of every member. He should, therefore, say nothing on that head, though he believed there was the most ample room for commendation; but,
<col>572</col>
in the private duties of the chair, he had more frequent opportunities than others to observe the punctuality of attendance, and the zealous endeavours to forward the business that came before him, by which the right hon. gent. now proposed established the strongest claim to the approbation and confidence of the house. It was unnecessary to add any thing to what had already been said; but he could not abstain from adverting to one expression which had fallen from the right hon. mover. The right hon. gent. expressed a wish, that all other discussions might be equally free from party motives as this. He could only say in answer, that if every proposition that should be introduced should be equally unexceptionable in its nature, no party interest should traverse it, at least so far as he was concerned. (An universal cry of chair; chair! Mr. Abbot, Mr. Abbot!)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Abbot</member> <membercontribution>then rose. He said, the proposition which his right hon. friend had submitted to the house as its first act, so far as it concerned the magnitude of the duties annexed to the chair, received his fullest concur<ob/>ence. The history and practice of parliament, at all periods, confirmed that opinion. But if it had been thus matter of grave and solemn deliberation, at all periods, into whose hands the high, important, difficult, and delicate duties of the chair should be entrusted, a just sense of the difficulties of the times in which we live, difficulties, which might be expected to increase instead of diminish, must make it matter of particularly serious consideration now. The partiality of his friends had ascribed to him a capacity for discharging those duties, which, gratefully as he acknowledged it as a mark of their kindness, filled him with fear when it led him to a comparison of the arduous nature of the task, with his humble ability to execute it. He had further only to add, that if the house, in the exercise of its first privilege, should think fit to call again into its service the qualifications it had experienced in him, they should be exerted with the utmost zeal and ability of which he was master. With this he submitted to the pleasure of the house. (An universal cry of chair! chair!)&#x2014;Mr. Abbot was then conducted to the chair by the mover and seconder of the motion, and when seated therein for a short interval he again rose and addressed the house thus:&#x2014;Since the house has been pleased to place me again in this chair, I desire from this place to return you my humblest thanks, and most grateful acknowledgments, for this additional proof of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0301"/>
<col>573</col>
your confidence and esteem. I have only now again to assure you, that while I have the honour of occupying it, I will constantly labour to deserve a continuance of your regard, by maintaining the dignity and authority of this house unimpaired, and by endeavouring to do so with fidelity and strict impartiality.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>availed himself of the usage of the house, to offer to the Speaker, not his congratulations, but the unanimous contratulations of the house of commons, and the unanimous congratulations of the public. The feelings of the friendship with which the Speaker had long honoured him, were alone sufficient to make him rejoice to see him again restored to a situation, which from every consideration, public and private, must be as desirable to him as it was honourable. But it was not so much from private considerations, as from a sense of the importance of the duties of the office, and of the peculiar qualifications to discharge them, that he exulted in the present appointment to the chair, to which the Speaker's former conduct in it gave additional lustre. The proper object of congratulation, was, not the Speaker, but the house, whose good fortune in providing so amply for the respectability, and utility of its presidency, could not be too highly estimated. On the first occasion on which the Speaker had been called to the chair, he had made the same modest comparison between the duties of the office and his sense of his own abilities to discharge them. To compare his feelings on that occasion, and on the present, was a thing that could scarcely be abstained from. The statement then offered of the arduous duties of the office, and of the incapacity, as the Speaker had been pleased to call it, of the individual to perform them, was then subject to the test of a severe criticism. There was fresh in the memory of the house the conduct of a predecessor in the chair, who in a time deeply marked with the violence of party conflicts, had so conducted himself as to acquire the unanimous approbation of men, who scarcely agreed in any thing else. Lord Sidmouth, the person to whom he alluded, was supposed to have possessed every quality which the idea of a perfect Speaker of the house of commons comprehended. It was enough to say, that on the comparison with him, the present Speaker was not found in any sense wanting. The dignity, authority, and utility of the character of the chair was as fully supported as at any former
<col>574</col>
period; and the respect which it was properly entitled to command, was not in any the slightest degree diminished. All that could be wished now, was the continuance of the conduct already experienced. The trial to which the Speaker was called was less unequal. All that was necessary to his honourable acquittal, was to persevere in doing as he had done. Nothing could be so gratifying, as to be called unanimously to a station so arduous and so exalted, after so full a trial. The silent assent of the house would have been perhaps sufficient to mark its according approbation. But, from the express and declared concurrence of persons, who were not in other instances likely to agree, the most unequivocal sanction of universal approbation was given. Thus, however, in the frequent changes of administration that had lately taken place, the minds of men might differ, as to those who might be best qualified to hold the reins of government in the country, there was no doubt any where that the chair of that house could by no other person be so well filled as by its present holder. Conscious that he must fall infinitely short of giving an adequate description either of his own feelings, or of those which the house entertained upon the present occasion, he should conclude with moving, that this house do now adjourn.&#x2014;The question being put from the chair, the house adjourned accordingly.</membercontribution></p>

<i>"My Lords and Gentlemen,</i><lb/>
"We have it in command from his majesty to state to you, that having deemed it expedient to recur to the sense of his people, his majesty, in conformity to his declared intention, has lost in time in causing the present parliament to be assembled &#2014; His majesty has great satisfaction in acquainting you, that, since the events which led to the dissolution of the last parliament, his majesty has received, in numerous addresses from his subjects, the warmest assurances of their affectionate attachment to his person and government, and of their firm resolution to support him, in maintaining the just rights of his crown, and the true principles of the constitution; and he commands us to express his entire confidence that he shall experience in all your deliberations a determination to afford him an equally loyal, zealous, and affectionate support , under all the arduous circumstances of the present time. &#x2014;We are commanded by his majesty to inform you, that his majesty's endeavours have been most anxiously employed for the purpose of drawing closer the ties by which his majesty is connected with the powers of the continent; of assisting the efforts of those powers against the ambition and oppression of France; of forming such engagements as may ensure their continued co-operation and of establishing that mutual confidence and concert, so essential, under any course of events, to the restoration of a solid and permanent
<col>578</col>
peace in Europe. &#x2014;It would have afforded his majesty the greatest pleasure to have been enabled to inform you, that the mediation undertaken by his majesty, for the purpose of preserving peace between his majesty's ally, the emperor of Russia, and the Sublime Porte, had proved effectual for that important object; his majesty deeply regrets the failure of that mediation, accompanied as it was by the disappointment of the efforts of his majesty's squadron, in the sea of Marmora, and followed, as it has since been, by the losses which have been sustained by his gallant troops in Egypt. &#x2014;His majesty could not but lament the extension of hostilities in any quarter, which should create a diversion in the war, so favourable to the views of France; but lamenting it, especially in the instance of a power with which his majesty has been so closely connected, and which has been so recently indebted for its protection against the incroachments of France, to the signal and successful interposition of his majesty's arms. &#x2014;His majesty has directed us to acquaint you, that he has thought it right to adopt such measures as might best enable him, in concert with the emperor of Russia, to take advantage of any favourable opportunity of bringing the hostilities in which they are engaged against the Sublime Porte, to a conclusion, consistent with his majesty's honour, and the interests of his Ally.<lb/>
<i>"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</i><lb/>
His majesty has ordered the estimates of the current year to be laid before you, and he relies on the tried loyalty and zeal of his faithful commons to make such provisions for the public service, as well as for the further application of the sums which were granted in the last parliament, as may appear to be necessary. &#x2014;And his majesty, bearing constantly in mind the necessity of a careful and economical administration of the pecuniary resources of the country, has directed us to express his hopes, that you, will proceed, without delay, in the pursuit of those inquiries, connected with the public economy, which engaged the attention of the last parliament.<lb/>
<i>My Lords and Gentlemen,</i><lb/>
"His majesty commands us to state to you, that he is deeply impressed with the peculiar importance, at the present moment, of cherishing a spirit of union and harmony among his people: such a spirit will most effectually promote the prosperity of the country at home, will give vigour and efficacy to its councils, and its arms abroad;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0304"/>
<col>579</col>
and can alone enable his majesty, under the blessing of providence, to carry on successfully the great contest in which he is engaged, or finally to conduct it to that termination which his majesty's moderation and justice have ever led him to seek, peace&#x2014;in which the honour and interests of his kingdom can be secure, and in which Europe and the world may hope for independence and repose.'<lb/>
The commmons then withdrew, and the lords adjourned for a short time to unrobe. Having again assembled, his Majesty's Speech was read by the lord chancellor, and afterwards by the clerk at the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Mansfield rose</member> <membercontribution>to move the address. At a crisis like the present, he wished it had fallen to the lot of some noble lord more able and experienced than himself, to move an address to his majesty, he felt himself incompetent to the task and hoped to meet with the indulgence of the house. He did not come forward upon this occasion with any party views, and whilst he disdained to be the servile tool of any administration, so, on the other hand, he was equally inimical to a systematic opposition to the measures of government, whether those measures were injurious or conducive to the public good. Some parts, however, of his majesty's speech, had struck his mind very forcibly, and upon those he would briefly deliver his opinion. The circumstances which occurred respecting the proposed concessions to the Catholics, and the differences which on that occasion took place between his majesty and his late ministers, rendered it impossible, that those ministers could remain in office, and rendered an appeal to the people absolutely necessary. He rejoiced at the effect of that appeal, he rejoiced that addresses had poured in from every quarter of the country, evincing the most zealous and steady loyalty and attachment to his majesty's government, and to the constitution of the country, and whilst he regretted that any of those addresses should convey a censure upon many eminent characters, he should have still more regretted if no such addresses had been presented. It was greatly to be lamented that a subject should have been agitated, which of all others was the most likely to inflame and irritate men's ,minds; he hoped that that irritation would now he allayed and that union and concert would invigorate the hands of government, and strengthen the country. In alluding to one topic mentioned in his,majesty's speech; namely, the unfortunate events which had
<col>580</col>
taken place in the Sea of Marmora, and in Egypt, he did not wish to cast censure any where until those documents were before the house, which could enable it to decide; with propriety. He trusted, however, that in the mean time no attempt would be made to throw the blame upon the officers employed on those services. The events were most unfortunate; but he trusted they would only prove an additional incentive to our gallant soldiers and seamen, to efface their memory by splendid victories and brilliant achievements. He trusted, also, that the measure since adopted would have the desired effect, of inducing the Porte to adopt those measures which were consistent with her real interests. There was another topic in his majesty's speech to which he wished to advert, although it was rather addressed to the house of commons than to their lordships, inasmuch as it formed an additional argument for the address which he should move; he alluded to the wish expressed by his majesty, that they should proceed in those enquiries respecting the economy of the public money, which they had commenced in the last parliament. This was an additional incitement for their lordships to express to his majesty their loyalty and attachment, whilst it proved that there was not the slightest wish that those inquiries should be dropped, which had been interrupted by the dissolution of parliament. It was his most ardent wish that upon such an occasion, engaged as we were in war, carrying on a contest in which all the energies of the country were required to be exerted, and when, as in the present case, the speech from the throne was temperate and conciliatory, that there should be an unanimous vote. If that, however, in the present state of parties, and under the present differences of opinion, was not to be expected, he trusted that they would he at least unanimous in expressing their cordial, zealous, and loyal attachment to his majesty, whose mild and benignant government, and whose unerring discretion in the exercise of his royal prerogatives called loudly for that tribute to his numerous virtues. His lordship concluded by moving an address to his majesty, which, as usual, was nearly an echo to his majesty's speech. &#x2014;The proposed address having been read by the lord chancellor,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Rolle rose</member> <membercontribution>to second it. His lordship declared, that he came forward uninfluenced by any party considerations, and solely from motives of loyalty and attachment to his majesty. He condemned the conduct
<image src="S1V0009P0I0305"/>
<col>581</col>
of the late ministers towards his majesty, and deprecated an attempt to embitter the latter days of their sovereign by exciting agitation, and the most irritable feelings throughout the country. He declined entering into any consideration of the unfortunate events in the Sea of Marmora and Egypt, the necessary documents not being before the house; he could not help, however, deeply regretting that such circumstances should have occurred. He highly approved of that, part of his majesty's speech, which desired that the inquiries into the public expenditure should be resumed, and agreed with the noble earl, that it was an additional incitement for expressing their attachment to his majesty, which he hoped would be expressed unanimously.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Fortescue rose</member> <membercontribution>for the purpose of moving an amendment, when he considered the manner in which the last parliament was dissolved, and the speech which had been now put into the mouth of his majesty, his lordship said he could not avoid expressing his greatest surprize at the conduct of his majesty's ministers. The last parlialiament, beyond any other, had teemed, with measures of the greatest importance to the country, many of which were interrupted by its sudden and abrupt dissolution&#x2014;a dissolution which had also been productive of the greatest inconvenience and distress to numerous individuals, from the interruption given to a great number of private bills. It had been urged by the supporters of the present ministers, that this inconvenience might be easily remedied by taking up those bills at the stages where they were left; but this operated to establish a principle pregnant with the utmost danger to the country, and he did not believe that the noble and learned lord upon the woolsack would defend the principle of resorting upon such an occasion, to a suspension of their standing orders. He could not forget the solemn mockery with which the Scots Judges were ordered to attend at the bar of the house, when it must be well known to his majesty's ministers that the bar would be, as it was, closed against them by the king's commissioners coming to the house to prorogue the parliament. Viewing all the circumstances under which the last parliament was dissolved, he could only consider that dissolution as a strong and arbitrary measure&#x2014;a measure to which those ministers alone were entitled to resort who possessed the confidence of the country. What pretensions had the present ministers to the
<col>582</col>
confidence of the country? they had already been tried in the public balance and had been proved wanting. They had only received the accession of a gentleman, certainly highly respectable, who had quitted his own profession to embark in politics, and who had since chiefly distinguished himself by fulminating anathemas, not only against Catholics, but against all descriptions of meeting-houses, nay, even against Synagogues; in short, against every person who would not sign the test of the infallibility of the present administration. After the parliament was dissolved the most Jacobinical means were resorted to, to inflame and irritate the country, a cry of "no popery" was set up, commencing with an address to the electors of Northampton, bursting into open riot at Bristol and Liverpool, and extending over the whole country the most irritating and inflammatory influence. It was, indeed, fortunate that the horrors which were witnessed in the metropolis in the year 1780, had not been revived; but no exertions seemed to have been spared to produce that irritation, which only fell short of the same horrible results. The noble earl who had moved, and the noble lord who had seconded the address, had spoken much of their attachment to his majesty. He did not mean to dispute their attachment; but he trusted they would not claim a monopoly of loyalty and attachment to his majesty. He revered his sovereign as much as these noble lords could do; nor would he be outdone in that affection and attachment which were due to his majesty's public and private virtues. He could not, however, suffer himself to be blinded by that attachment into a neglect or compromise of the principles of the constitution; and when he saw these principles violated by the conduct of the king's ministers, he would endeavour to do his duty as a lord of parliament, by delivering those sentiments which, in his judgment, the occasion called for. It had been said that numerous addresses had manifested the sense of the people, but was it to be contended, that because addresses had been procured from chapters and corporations, that therefore they spoke the sense of the people. Considering the subject in these points of view, and upon the grounds which he had stated, he felt it his duty to move an amendment, which, if carried, it would then be for the consideration of the house as to the manner in which it should be incorporated. The following amendment was moved by his lordship: &#x2014;"That by a long
<image src="S1V0009P0I0306"/>
<col>583</col>
experience of his majesty's virtues, we well know it to be his majesty's invariable wish, that all his prerogatives should be exercised solely for the advantage of his people. That our dutiful attachment to his majesty's person and government, obliges us therefore most humbly to lay before him the manifest misconduct of his ministers, in having advised the dissolution of the late parliament, in the midst of its first session, and within a few months after his majesty had been pleased to assemble it for the dispatch of the urgent business of the nation. &#x2014;That this measure, advised by his majesty's ministers, at a time when there existed no difference between any of the branches of the legislature, nor any sufficient anise for an appeal to his majesty's people, was justified by no public necessity or advantage. That by the interruption of all private business then depending in parliament, it has been productive of great and needless inconvenience and expense, thereby wantonly adding to the heavy burdens which the necessities of the times require. That it has retarded many useful laws for the internal improvement of the kingdom, and for the encouragement and extension of its agriculture, manufactures, and commerce. And that it has either suspended or wholly defeated, many most important public measures, and protracted much of the most weighty business of parliament, to a season of the year when its prosecution must be attended with the greatest public and private inconvenience. And that we feel ourselves bound still further to submit to his majesty, that all these mischiefs are greatly aggravated by the groundless and injurious pretences on which his majesty's ministers have publicly rested their evil advices; pretences affording no justification for the measure, but calculated only to excite the most dangerous animosities among his majesty's faithful subjects, at a period when their united, effects were more than ever necessary for the security of the empire, and when to promote the utmost harmony and co operation amongst them would have been the first object of faithful and provident ministers. &#x2014;The amendment being read,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Boringdon</member> <membercontribution>said, he was sorry to find himself compelled to differ from the noble lord who had just sat down, and for whom, as a friend, he had the highest esteem. His noble friend had directed a considerable portion of his argument against the late dissolution of parliament. He did not wish to go at length into the circumstances which
<col>584</col>
led to that dissolution, the question having been so often argued. It was clear, however, to his mind, that the late ministers; placed themselves in that situation which rendered their continuance in office impossible, without an anomaly in the constitution before unheard of; namely, that of ministers remaining in office with opinions directly hostile to those of their sovereign. To dissolve the parliament was his majesty's undoubted, prerogative, for the exercise of which his confidential advisers were responsible. This principle was the same for whatever period the parliament had sat, and no preference could be given in the argument with respect to a parliament which had sat five sessions over one which had sat only two sessions, or to a parliament which had sat four sessions, over one which had sat only one session. He meant only to apply this to the dissolution of parliament resorted to by the late ministers. For the dissolution resorted to by the present ministers, there were urgent reasons of necessity. The friends of the late administration were sufficiently numerous in the other house to embarrass the operations of government, although not strong enough to bring themselves again into power. It, therefore, became necessary to appeal to the people, and this was rendered the more necessary by the irritation and difference of opinion which had been excited by the uncalled-for agitation of a question, calculated in an eminent degree to produce all those effects. Where, however, was the necessity for the dissolution resorted to by the late ministers in October last? the country was at that time quiet, there was no material difference of opinion upon any public topic, nothing in fact that could create the least necessity for a dissolution. It had been urged, that the rupture of the negociation with France was a sufficient ground for the measure. If this were so, then the rupture of every negociation in which the country had been engaged, would have been a sufficient ground for a similar measure; this, however, had never before been pretended. The arguments, therefore, of his noble friend, went much more against the dissolution resorted to by the late administration, than that to which the present ministers had had recourse. It had been said, that the cry of "no popery" had been raised by the present ministers, in order to raise a prejudice in their favour. He admitted that such a cry had existed in several places amongst the people; but, he denied that it had been raised by his majesty's ministers
<image src="S1V0009P0I0307"/>
<col>585</col>
It were absurd to suppose that such a ridiculous cry could have been set up by his majesty's ministers, and the state of the elections abundantly proved that it had not been. If ministers had wished to raise such a cry, surely it would have been easy to find persons who would have been instrumental to such a purpose in Yorkshire, in Middlesex, and in other places. His noble friend had passed over in silence, the events which had taken place before Constantinople and in Egypt. He did not wish to discuss now the unfortunate results of those expeditions; but he could not help calling to the recollection of their lordships, the triumphant tone in which a noble lord (Kinnaird) of considerable talents, whom he regretted was not now a member of that house, spoke when a rumour reached this country, that the Turkish government had acceded to the terms proposed. That noble lord spoke of the Turkish empire being at the feet of Britain, and asked to whose wisdoms and to whose policy we were indebted for so glorious an event? He would now ask to whose wisdom and to whose policy we were indebted for the unfortunate consequences of those expeditions? He could not conceive any occasion on which unanimity was more desirable than the present, and in that house more peculiarly, where it had not been the practice to move amendments to addresses, for he found that in the course of 25 years there were only three instances, namely, in 1801, in 1794, and 1795, where amendments were moved. He thought that a period like the present was one, when they should least of all deviate from the practice of the house, more peculiarly when the united energies of the country were required to combat an enemy, who had owed his successes more to the divisions amongst his opponents than to the skill or valour of his troops.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>said, he felt some difficulty upon the present occasion, not in answering the arguments of noble lords on the other side, but, after what he had heard, in doing it with that decorum which he owed to their lordships. If the arguments of the noble lord who had just sat down, were to be adopted as the rule of conduct in that house, then all freedom of debate was at an end, and their lordships would have nothing to do but to re-echo every speech which the ministers for the time being chose to put in to the mouth of his majesty. Such doctrines were the most dangerous and unconstitutional he had ever heard. Be objected also most strongly, to the introduction of
<col>586</col>
the king's name, and the king's opinions, into a debate in that house, as they bad been upon this occasion. A noble lord (Rolle) had talked of embittering the latter days of his majesty. Gracious God! my lords, is it to be endured, that debates in this house are to be thus attempted to be influenced? if these opinions are to prevail, there is an end of the liberties of the people. What may be the consequences? My noble friend (lord Grenville) may, on this principle, say, with respect to the expedition to Constantinople and to Egypt, that it was the king's will; that it was the king's opinion that such an expedition should be sent. If such a principle is to be allowed, it is impossible to say where it can stop, until it has destroyed the privileges of this house and of parliament, and sapped and undermined the constitution itself. The noble lord has spoken of its being the practice of this house not to move amendments to addresses. During the few years I have been in parliament, it has been my misfortune (as probably the noble lord would call it) to be the greater part of that time in opposition; and, if my memory does not greatly deceive me, there are several more instances of amendments being moved to addresses than those quoted by the noble lord. But in what way, my lords, can this argument of the noble lord operate against the constitutional privilege of this house, to offer those sentiments to the throne which we conceive to be called for by our duty to our country? The noble lord, in speaking of dissolutions of parliament, has only stated that which was obvious, namely, that it is the king's undoubted prerogative to dissolve the parliament, and that his ministers are responsible for the exercise of that prerogative. The noble lord then went on to argue as to there being no preference between dissolving parliaments at different periods of their existence; but will it he contended for a moment that there is no difference between dissolving a parliament that has sat five years, and one which has sat only so many months? If the principle is good for any thing, it goes to this, that a parliament ought not to be dissolved at all, but be allowed to sit its full seven years; for the. same arguments which the noble lord has applied against the dissolution resorted to by the late ministers when the parliament had sat four years, would apply to a parliament that had sat six years, and are decidedly against the dissolution of the last parliament, which the noble lord has nevertheless defended.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0308"/>
<col>587</col>
After hearing the defence set up by the noble lord for the late dissolution, I am surprised when a noble secretary of state (lord Hawkesbury) so eloquently declaimed against the dissolution of the preceding parliament, that the noble lord did not then rise to answer his arguments. The noble lord has, however, had recourse to a sort of <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, in attacking the dissolution resorted to by the last ministers, but his argument decidedly makes against the point he intended to prove. The noble lord states, that at the time of that dissolution there was no irritation of the public mind, no material difference of opinion. Why, then, was not that the moment for an appeal to the people? The noble lord then states, that at the time of the last dissolution there was great irritability and collision of opinion. Is it not then clear, that that was a most improper period for a dissolution of parliament, when, instead of a cool and dispassionate appeal to the people, it could only be an appeal to their inflamed prejudices and passions? But my lords, is there no difference between dissolving parliament in the recess, and in the midst of a session? The opinion of one of the greatest men this country boasts, I mean, lord Somers, was, that to dissolve parliament in the midst of a session, was, if not absolutely, at least almost, illegal, and I will not allow for a moment that a prorogation for a day, followed by a dissolution, can make the slightest difference. It is a mere evasion. The noble lord having used an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>, I may also be allowed the same kind of argument, and I call upon the noble duke now at the head of his majesty's counsels to take into his hand the speech now put into the mouth of his majesty, the speech delivered from the throne in the year 1784, and the amendment then moved in the other house of parliament, by Mr. Burke, which had the entire concurrence of the noble duke. If the noble duke can devote his attention to the subject, he will find those constitutional principles most ably and eloquently enforced in that amendment, which have now been so flagrantly violated. We were told in the speech put into the mouth of the king on the prorogation of the last parliament, that that was the most convenient time for putting a period to the business of parliament. It is impossible for me to apply that expression to this assertion of the ministers which it deserves. The most convenient time! when business of the utmost importance was interrupted, when
<col>588</col>
there was no appropriation of the public money! And, my lords, I should wish to know whether the public money has not been, in consequence, illegally appropriated. My lords, these measures tend to make this house a cypher in the constitution. The great opulence which centers in this house contributes largely to the supplies, and the only hold we have upon them is the appropriation act. Supplies are not now raised as they formerly were; and the arguments which formerly justified resisting the supplies will not now justify them. Ministers have the supplies in their hands from the nature of the taxes; and if they can appropriate them, too, without coming to parliament, what security have we that parliaments will be assembled at all? My lords, these daily growing infringements of the constitution demand our most serious and earnest attention. I, who think the influence of the crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished, am a friend to frequent appeals to the people, but not by means of dissolutions. Let parliaments, instead of septennial, he triennial, or I would not object to their being annual; let there be stated earlier periods for a recurrence to the sense of the people; but if parliament is to be threatened with dissolution&#x2014;and I maintain that the entrance of that misguided monarch, Charles I. into the house of commons<sup>*</sup> was not a more outrageous violation of the constitution, than the threat used by a right hon. secretary of state, (Mr. Canning) in the late house of commons&#x2014;then parliament becomes subjected to the will of the crown, as many would then weigh in the balance a seat which they may instantly lose, and a seat for six years, which will necessarily have an undue influence upon votes. The only objection I have to the late house of commons is, that they did not adopt those strong and energetic measures which such a threat imperiously called for. &#x2014;With respect to the events which have happened in the Mediterranean and in Egypt, those with whom .I had the honour to act, as well as myself, are anxious that every inquiry should be instituted which can tend to elucidate the circumstances which led to those events; but when I look at that part of the speech from the throne which refers to these events, I cannot help observing that the penman of this speech, in his eagerness to censure the late ministers, has put into his majesty's mouth a strong

<image src="S1V0009P0I0309"/>
<col>589</col>
condemnation of his majesty's government. I also find in the same speech a desire that union and harmony may prevail. This recommendation of ministers, under the circumstances in which it is made, brings to my recollection a story which is almost too ludicrous for this house. but which is so extremely applicable that I cannot refrain from relating it. Two persons in another part of the united kingdom having been at a fair, where less of that amusement had taken place than frequently prevails at fairs in that country, were displeased on their return that there had not been enough of what they called "rowing;" after consulting together a little, one of them said to the other, I will tell you a sure way of having a row, let us go back to the fair and preach up "peace and good order." The noble lord has denied that ministers have raised any cry of "no popery," but, my lords, look at the address of the new chancellor of the exchequer to the electors of Northampton; look also at those newspapers which are understood to be in the interest of government. My lords, in one of these papers it was observed immediately after the prorogation of parliament, that it was hoped the cry of "no popery" which had issued from the throne would be re-echoed in every quarter of the country. The noble lord has cast the cry upon the shoulders of the people; but the people in general have too much good sense to be duped by such a cry, and the ministers with all their efforts have failed in their experiment. Let me however, pay that tribute to the right reverend prelates who sit in this house, to which they are entitled, for that firmness and moderation, which, amidst the cry to which I have alluded, have uniformly marked their conduct. There is another part of the speech, my lords, against which I protest, as most unconstitutional. We are told that the Addresses to which my noble friend (earl Fortescue) alluded, as addresses from chapters and corporations, we are told that these addresses have expressed the sense of the people. Thus, after an appeal to the people, the new parliament are to be told at the outset, we do not want you to express the sense of the people, it has been already expressed by chapters and corporations, and riotous meetings. My lords, I feel myself called upon by every motive of public duty to support this amendment. We have heard this night of systematic opposition; but if ministers come into power upon unconstitutional principles, it is childish and absurd to talk of any other opposition than
<col>590</col>
that of an united body, firmly acting upon the principles of the constitution, and determined to resist by every constitutional means those who have no other title to power than faction and intrigue.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Mulgrave</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the great object of censure from the other side of the house, was the dissolution of parliament, the legality of which the noble lord (Holland) had questioned But this dissolution was not without good reasons; reasons which did not exist when the former dissolution in October last had taken place. Measures of the greatest moment, brought forward by the late ministers, had been passed by the parliament which was then dissolved, and these also incompatible, in some degree, with former measures agreed to by the same parliament. Ministers had not then to fear any very formidable opposition, nor any factious Tavern Meetings, to concert schemes to obstruct the operations of government; yet they dissolved that parliament. But before the late dissolution it was suspected that the noble lords on the other side, and their friends, would not shew an equal degree of moderation, and as far as experience had yet gone, the suspicion appeared to have been well-founded, and a dissolution became advisable. What was the ground of the dissolution in October? Was it the failure of the negotiation? Disgraceful and ridiculous as the conduct of that negotiation had been throughout, yet it was not perhaps so bad as people apprehended it was, when they saw that the expedient of a dissolution was resorted to. The noble lord then proceeded to compare the dissolution of 1784 with the late one. The dissolution of 1784 was founded on the best reasons of any he had heard of, except the last. The circumstances were, in a great measure, similar. The house of commons had then passed a measure pregnant with danger to the constitution, and when the king in consequence, thought proper to change his ministers. The junction of parties, formerly hostile to each other, enabled them to overpower the government. An appeal to the people then became necessary. Though in the late parliament the ministers had a majority, yet the opposite party had a number sufficient to embarrass the operations of government. A dissolution therefore became advisable. The cases were nearly similar, with this exception, however, that they on the other side who approved of the dissolution of 1784, censured the last. The cry of private influence had then been set up, and the noble
<image src="S1V0009P0I0310"/>
<col>591</col>
lord on the opposite side (Grenville) had considered that cry as ridiculous then, though he had now joined in it. But the noble lord now acted with different persons, and "evil communications Corrupt good man"ners." Then a dangerous measure had been passed by the commons, now an attack had been made on the personal conduct of the king. A great deal had been said about setting up the cry of "No Popery," but they themselves had set up that cry, The present ministry had nothing to do with it. The noble lord then detailed the proceedings respecting what had been called the Roman Catholic Measure, and contended that by that the late ministers had raised the cry which they now wished to shift from themselves to the present ministers. A noble lord (Holland) said, that it was an amomaly in the constitution that the king could think at all. Now the late ministers had declared their wishes to his majesty to explain their conduct, because they had seen a paragraph in a newspaper which they did not like. By this means they wished to lay the blame op his majesty, but at the same time they must, as faithful counsellors, have advised him not to comply with their request, because it was an anomaly in the constitution, that he should think at all. How could the noble lords reconcile this contradiction? He declared that he was unable to meet with such another attempt to bring blame directly upon the Sovereign in the whole history of the country. The noble lords on the opposite side also objected to the introduction of the allusions to the failure in the sea of Marmora and Egypt. But if we did meet with reverses, were these to be passed over in silence? If objects were undertaken without means, and if we were to be baffled by the weakest of enemies, were these things to be suffered to pass over like a morning Cloud? No, surely. The speech stated the facts, and they were facts worthy of notice. The noble lord concluded, by declaring his warm concurrence in the address.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, said, that, what he had stated was, that the mention of the failures was evidently introduced as a censure on the late government, and therefore made his majesty censure his own acts. He had not deprecated but courted inquiry into whole conduct of the late ministry. He had only said, that the present censure was premature and inconsistent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Erskine</member> <membercontribution>said, that the observations of his noble friend (lord Holland) had called to his recollection the part which he himself
<col>592</col>
had acted in the year 1784 along with the noble duke opposite (Portland). He called upon the noble duke to reconcile his present conduct with what it had been at that period. Under the auspices of that noble duke he had drawn up an address to the king against the dissolution, and had assisted in carrying it to the foot of the throne. That address stated that the dissolution of parliament merely at the pleasure of every minister would be attended with the most dangerous consequences; that it was fitting that ministers should yield to parliaments, and not parliaments to them; that ministers would, by holding threats of a dissolution over the commons, afford them the strongest inducements to abandon the interests of their constituents, and that a mortal blow would thus be given to the popular branch of the constitution. How Could the noble duke reconcile his present conduct with these sentiments? The noble lord on the other side (Mulgrave) had said, that he and his friends had not set up the cry of "no popery," and that the dissolution was the consequence of a personal attack on the king. He desired that the speech respecting the dissolution should be read (this was accordingly read by the Clerk at the table). He now appealed to the honour of the house, to the English language, and to common sense, whether the cry of no popery did not run through the whole speech, and whether, as appeared from that, the pretended danger to the church, and not the explanation of ministers, was not the alleged cause of the dissolution? The late ministers had been grossly calumniated: they had been accused of disrespect to their sovereign, whom no man more deeply revered than he did, and of an attempt to deceive him. Under these circumstances, they had requested permission to state the facts as they really, were, not for the purposes of discussion, but merely to bring before parliament the true state of the case; and to clear themselves from a most foul and groundless calumny. The noble lord said, that they had abandoned a measure which they had stated to he indispensible to the security of Ireland. But there was surely some difference between What was highly expedient and what was essentially necessary. They had consented to give up the measure for the present, in deference to the feelings of his majesty, being convinced, however, of its expediency, and reserving the liberty of submitting to the king, for his decision, the same question, if it should
<image src="S1V0009P0I0311"/>
<col>593</col>
appear to them, at a future period, to be absolutely necessary. But could this proceeding be the ground for dissolving the parliament? Were parliaments then to suffer for the conduct of ministers? What had the late house of commons done that it should be dissolved? In 1784, the house had passed a measure which was considered as obnoxious; but what had the late house of commons done? It had certainly not passed the Catholic bill, though the ministers had proposed it. Upon what principle, then, was it charged with the acts of ministers? The previous dissolution, in October, had taken place when parliament was not sitting, and when no public business was interrupted. It was a material object to have greater unanimity in times of great danger and difficulty, and the dissolution answered that purpose. How then, could the cases, he said, be parallel? Were parliaments then to be dissolved, always, whenever the king thought proper to change his ministers? If this was the case, if the threats of secretaries of state were to be held out <i>in terrorem</i>, and if parliaments were to suffer for the conduct of ministers, it was much to be feared that the consequences to the constitution would be of the most alarming nature. He was afraid it would be thought that the crown, from the greatness of the expenditure, and the consequent increase of offices, had too much influence in the choosing of the members, and that the constitution would be considered as degenerating fast into an absolute monarchy. He dreaded lest the house of commons might be placed in a situation where the representatives would find the strongest temptations to abandon the cause of their constituents, and become little better them appendages to the ministers of the crown.&#x2014;The noble lord declared his firm conviction of the truth of christianity, and of its benignant and civilizing influence, although it had often been wrested to the worst of purposes. Of the melancholy effects of stirring up religious clamours, history afforded abundant instances. Was it, then, amidst the prevalence of a fanatical and unfounded cry, that parliament ought to have been dissolved? Ought advantages to have been taken of the agitations produced by an appeal to the worst and most violent passions of a misguided people? He did not observe his noble and learned friend, the chief justice of the king's bench (lord Ellenborough) in his place. But if he were in the house, he would have appealed to him, whether it was not the prac-
<col>594</col>
tice in his court to put off the hearing of a common cause, when the public mind was strongly agitated about the circumstances. How much more, then, was it necessary to have allowed the passions of the people to cool, before they should be called on to decide on a measure of this magnitude? There was a very marked distinction between the dissolution or 1784 and the last one. The last house of commons had done no one act that could call for it; it had not even expressed any bad opinions of the present ministers; except, indeed, its having passed a resolution against granting offices in reversion, or offices for life that had been usually held during pleasure, could be considered as such. His noble friend (lord Holland) had told a ludicrous story about a method for having a row. He also recollected a story that was somewhat in point. A person wishing to have a quarrel came up to another who was standing with his back to the fire and feeling very comfortable, and said, "You lie, sir;" "truly," said the other, "I did not speak." "No matter," said the quarrelling gentleman, "you lie, sir." So the last parliament stood with its back to the fire; it did nothing offensive, and yet it was dissolved. But if parliaments were to look with apprehension to ministers instead of ministers having a proper respect to parliament, then the house of commons was destroyed, and there was an end of the constitution. If, when the people Were so much burthened with taxes which they cheerfully paid when convinced that the public service required them, if in these circumstances they should be compelled to believe that they had no security in their representatives, what would be the consequences. Convinced that they had no safeguard against the exactions of ministers, no security for the proper application of the revenue, they had begin to think that their burthens were heavier than the public service required, and having no remedy for the grievance, they might be apt to become desperate. This was the origin of revolutions, and was a state of things which ought to be carefully avoided. It was ridiculous and unconstitutional to set the addresses of corporations and meetings against the opinion of the house of commons, which was the proper organ to convey the sense of the people to the crown. If these addresses were favourable, then they were held up as the sense of the people; if unfavourable, they were said to be seditious, and trials for such addresses might be recollected. If the ad-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0312"/>
<col>595</col>
dresses were not favourable, then the grapes were sour, and they could not eat them. He concluded by declaring his assent to the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Grosvenor</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the king's speech, instead of being previously read at the Cockpit as formerly, was now read at private meetings, so that noble lords could not be prepared, and therefore he thought it might not be improper to adjourn for twenty-four hours, in order to have time to consider the speech. He adverted to the conduct of the ministers since they came into power. Their first act was to have recourse to the assistance of lord Melville, notwithstanding the resolutions on the Journals of the house of commons. But that and other things dwindled almost to nothing in comparison with the unconstitutional act of dissolving the parliament. The present momentous crisis required a firm, an able, and an efficient ministry. Whether the present ministers came under that description, parliament must determine. But he thought they afforded but an unfavourable specimen of their future conduct, by shrinking from the responsibility of having advised the dismissal of the late ministers. It was a constitutional maxim, founded in wisdom, that the king could do no wrong; for if he could, what scenes of bloodshed must ensue before he could be brought to do justice. The parliament, he said, had done nothing that could require a dissolution. The reason alledged for it was, the expediency of taking the sense of the people. That, he contended, was the late ministers, and instanced the great county of York. His lordship then adverted to the accusations against the late ministers, for opposing the government. One would think, he observed, on hearing these, that this was some despotic government. The king had his prerogative, but the houses of lords and commons had their prerogative also; and there seldom had been an occasion on which it was more requisite for them to exercise it than the present.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>observed, that if he had hopes before that unanimity would prevail on this occasion, he must now own he was afraid he was disappointed. But he did feel that unanimity was so important to the interests of the country in the present situation of affairs, that unless the address expressed opinions in which he could not concur, or contained unfounded accusations, he should feel himself bound in duty to support it. But, if noble lords really thought that
<col>596</col>
the dissolution of the last parliament was ill advised, he perfectly agreed that this was the most proper occasion for them to express hat opinion. He would go farther; something had been said here, and a great deal out of doors, about the impropriety of giving notice, that a division would certainly take place on the address. That clamour, he had no hesitation to say, was unfounded. If it had been stated that amendments were to be proposed in certain passages before the speech was fully determined on, and before the precise nature of it could be known, that indeed would have been indecent. But having in contemplation such an amendment as this, they might safely say beforehand that a division would certainly take place, because they might be assured that minister would not censure their own act. He thought it due to the noble lords, therefore, to state the impression made on his mind by this circumstance. He again stated, that he most strongly felt the necessity of unanimity. Their lordships were now in a different situation from what they were before, when it was matter of complaint, that an abstract proposition was brought forward, the effect of which, if assented to, would have been to annul the prerogative of the king, in the choice of his ministers. The fact of the advice had been there assumed, and censure was to proceed upon that. But the dissolution was an act of government, and the fact of the advice was certain. The only question, therefore, was, whether it was blameable? He had before stated his deep regret at the change of the ministry, and that regret he still retained; but that having been unavoidable, he thought the dissolution, in the state of parties, to be unavoidable also, and therefore warrantable and justifiable. He could not, therefore, say with the amendment, that the ministers, were guilty of manifest misconduct in this particular.&#x2014;Much had been said about the agitations which had been produced in the country. He trusted he need not state that he would join in no party cry, that had deception and intolerance for its object. When he came into administration, in 1801, under circumstances not dissimilar, he had raised no cry about the church being in danger. Parliament was not dissolved till the year after, and not a word was said about danger to the church. The fact was, that the late events had peculiarly interested the feelings of the people. If the cry was raised for the purpose of making a stalking horse of the danger to the church, it was undoubtedly cen-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0313"/>
<col>597</col>
surable. But that had been disclaimed, and he hoped, that the negation was well-founded. But much of the cry arose from an attachment to the established church, and an opinion that no further concessions ought to be made. Wherever that motive prevailed, he respected the cry, and he thought that it had afforded additional security to the established church, which, notwithstanding what a noble lord (Holland) had said, he thought intimately connected with the constitution. &#x2014;There was no distinction in principle, he said, between the dissolutions of April and October. As to the inconvenience to the public business, the same thing had taken place in 1784, and as he had concurred in that, he could not on this account disapprove of the last dissolution. He hoped the present ministers would establish their efficiency. The crisis was momentous. He hoped they would recollect that we were at war against the most formidable enemy that had ever threatened this country, the destruction of which he was meditating, no less on the banks of the Vistula, than if he were on the banks of the Seine. He hoped ministers were sensible of our peril, that government was fully impressed with the danger, and had prepared measures to meet it. He would judge of them, not only by their measures, but by the weight they would have both at borne and abroad. If they were deficient in any of these essential requisites, they were unfit for the crisis, and ought not to continue in office. He would do to them as he would wish others to do by him. He would judge them by their conduct. His party was the country and his king, and he felt it his duty, under all the circumstances, to resist the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member> <membercontribution>declared his concurrence in the observations made by the noble viscount who had just sat down, and thought that the late dissolution of parliament could not be reprobated on any principle that would not equally apply to that of last year. The inconvenience arising from a dissolution must be balanced by the strength of the reasons which required it. The noble and learned lord (Erskine) in comparing the present case with that of 1784, had alleged that there was no ground for the late dissolution, because the house of commons had not, in the late case, come to issue with the government on any particular question; but a very large proportion of the house had concurred in the expression of principles subversive of the constitutional prerogatives of the crown. Principles had been laid down
<col>598</col>
and supported by very great numbers, which, would reduce to an empty name the prerogative of the king in choosing his own ministers. It had been alleged, that an unconstitutional pledge had been demanded of ministers, and that, without inquiring who had really been the advisers, their successors were to be held as responsible for that demand. The necessary consequence from this doctrine was, that no other ministry could possibly accept of office constitutionally, which was as much as to say, that the king could not legally dismiss the ministers he actually had. This was a doctrine that went to subvert the constitution, and distinguished those who held it from all former oppositions. When a set of ministers bad by their conduct proved themselves unfit for their situations, a systematic opposition was justifiable; but the doctrines that had been maintained in the last parliament would equally justify an opposition against the best ministers as against the worst. When so great a proportion of the house maintained so violent a doctrine, he thought that even though they did not absolutely amount to a majority, a case had occurred that fairly might justify an appeal to the people. But though he thus considered the dissolution as justifiable, and should therefore vote against the amendment that had been proposed to the address, he could not extend this to an approbation of government in the conduct of the elections, and particularly in the cry of "no popery" that had been encouraged, for though ministers now disclaimed it, yet circumstances were such, that it scented impossible for any reasonable and impartial man to doubt with whom the cry had originated; and he thought that their conduct in this respect deserved the reprobation of the, house and of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Rosslyn</member> <membercontribution>declared, that after the manner in which all arguments, and every attempt at argument, had been already answered; after the luminous speech which their lordships had heard from his noble and learned friend (lord Erskine), it Would be impossible for him to add any thing further upon the subject. The question which was then under their lordships' consideration, however, was of such importance, that, in justice to himself he was compelled to declare his sentiments, and not suffer the question to pass with only a silent vote from him. A noble viscount (lord Sidmouth) for whom he entertained the highest respect, had observed, that if it was justifiable to dissolve one parliament at any period short of its
<image src="S1V0009P0I0314"/>
<col>599</col>
statutable duration, we might, by parity of reasoning, justify all dissolutions of parliament, whatever might be the extent of the parliament's existence at the time when such an event took place, But he would ask that noble lord, and he would ask the house, if there was not, exclusive of the consideration of the length of time which the parliament had been then acting, and the length of time which it was entitled, by regular course of law, still to act; he would ask if, exclusive of this consideration, there was not some difference to be discovered in the circumstances under which a parliament might be dissolved? He would ask, what interruption the business of the public had met with during the existence of the late parliament? And knowing, as he did, and as he was convinced many of their lordships must also have observed, that the public business would, on the one hand, have been materially forwarded, if parliament had been suffered to continue in the exercise of its functions, until, at least, the business of the session was at an end, he thought, as, in fact, he thought was just in all cases where a parliament was dissolved in the middle of a session, that it was the duty of ministers to adduce sufficient argument, in the peculiar circumstances of tile case, to justify themselves for having advised the adoption of such a precipitate step; it was the act of his majesty's government, and the onus lay entirely with his majesty's servants. It had been said, however, in effect, by a noble lord opposite, that parliament was formerly dissolved upon nearly as bad ground as that upon which the dissolution of the late parliament took place. But he would ask any one of their lordships if it was a sufficient justification of their conduct for any one set of ministers to say to another: "You formerly adopted such a measure which was bad, and therefore we are now entitled to take another step, which is somewhat worse?" Such an attempt at argument, he was confident, could have no weight in such an enlightened assembly as that which he was then addressing. And he must declare most unequivocally, that in his opinion no one fair ground of justification had yet been given to parliament or to the country for the extraordinary advice which his majesty's present ministers had given to dissolve a parliament that was faithful to the country, loyal to the sovereign, and in the midst of transacting the most important business. But it might be said, that the church was in dan-
<col>600</col>
ger. That was a cry which had been raised too generally out of doors. He did not imagine that any noble lord would be bold enough to rise in his place as a peer of parliament, and declare that he seriously thought there could be any danger to the established church from any measure that had been proposed immediately before the dissolution, even if it were carried into effect. But how absurd, how ridiculously preposterous must it appear, to see that such an alarm was endeavoured to be excited in many parts of the country after that measure was withdrawn! It was a fact which still remained without a disavowal on the part of his majesty's ministers, and which was openly and publicly declared by many of their friends. At the same time, he had too high an opinion of their lordships' liberality and good sense to imagine, that any one noble lord in that house, whether a member of his majesty's government or not, ever once for a moment believed, that at this day there was any danger to the church establishment to be apprehended in England. But there was still a circumstance, respecting which he should be glad to be informed; he should be glad to know upon what ground it was stated in all the addresses to his majesty on this head, that the church and state were supposed to be in the most imminent danger? He was induced to ask for this information from his observation that these addresses uniformly came from places where ministers were known to have the greatest influence. In fact, their zeal was so very eager in its pursuit of addresses, that it was officially acknowledged in one instance that it outran the fact; an address was formally inserted in the London Gazette, from the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, in the city of Dublin, in support of this idle cry; but, was it a fact, that the members of that University actually joined in that senseless clamour? No; that learned body was too enlightened and too liberal to indulge in such a prejudice, as that with which they were attempted to be branded; and the same London Gazette, printed by the authority of government; was afterwards obliged to confess that no such address had been presented! &#x2014;Now that he spoke of public proceedings, he recollected, and it was a fact which must he known to many of their lordships, that an advertisement was printed in the public papers, signed with the name of his majesty's chancellor of the exchequer, thus adding the weight and influence of office to the authority which the learned gent.'s own name brought with it. He did not yet know that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0315"/>
<col>601</col>
this was contradicted, and while such a cry was suffered to be spread throughout the country without contradiction from those in whose name they were circulated, the prejudices of the people were wantonly excited. The people in many instances, took no time to consider more than if a cry of "fire, fire," was raised; though this should be done at a time when there was no danger, still the people, if they heard that the cry was raised by those whose duty it was to take care of their interests, might be apt not to consider or examine into the ground of the alarm, but betake themselves to any mean that was suggested to them as the most likely to insure their safety. At the same time that these alarms were spread without contradiction he could not refrain from noticing the duplicity of which his majesty's ministers were guilty; whilst they themselves appeared to be thus engaged in exciting animosity amongst his majesty's subjects, they put it into his majesty's mouth that he recommended unanimity among all classes and descriptions of his people. With the noble viscount (lord Sidmouth) he must observe, that of those men his expectations were not equal to his wishes, that they might save the country at the present momentous crisis. He should therefore support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Buckinghamshire</member> <membercontribution>maintained, that the conduct of his majesty's present ministers was strictly justifiable in having recommended the dissolution of the late parliament. The catholics would now see, that notwithstanding their cause was supported by a powerful and respectable party in this country, yet that the opinion of their sovereign was against them, and that in that opinion he was supported by the general-sentiments of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>said, he had no doubt, that the authors of the speech that day delivered to their lordships were the authors or advisers of the dissolution of parliament. It appeared, that the authors of the speech bad some idea of shrinking from responsibility, because they had not only been guilty of a violation of the ancient forms of the Constitution, but had that night remained silent on the subject of their misconduct. A noble lord had said, that on examining the Journals of the house, he had not been able to discover, in the course of 25 years, more than three amendments to the address. But that noble lord had not explained the cause why so few amendments had been brought forward in the course of that period. He would, how-
<col>602</col>
ever, tell the noble lord: the minister who had framed or sanctioned the addresses for that period, had been careful to conciliate the good wishes of parliament. In this instance, however, all attempts at conciliation had been carefully avoided. The wording or composition of the speech, his lordship observed, instead of being of a conciliatory nature, was the very reverse. As to the speech of the lords commissioners, not that of his majesty, for he could not consider it in any other view&#x2014;it was, in his lordship's opinion, of a most violent and acrimonious nature. It was any thing but conciliation. With regard to the dissolution of parliament, it was a measure which could not be too severely reprobated. The king's prerogative ought certainly to he freely exercised; but the secret advisers of a measure, for which there was no national necessity, deserved the severest censure. Some of the adherents of the present ministers had expressed a belief that the dissolution would pass without much censure; but his lordship always remained fully persuaded, that it was impossible men should not be found who would slim their utter indignation, nay detestation, of such an act; and that parliament was about to declare its disapprobation of the unconstitutional measure. Those who had no ground to justify the dissolution; but wanted some pretext for expressing their sentiments in favour of the administration, recurred to the parallel case of the year 1784, and therefore drew the conclusion, that as a dissolution had then taken place, a dissolution in the year 1807 was also justifiable. Such an observation was, however, erroneous in the extreme. A dissolution might be justified in the year 1784, and yet not be justifiable in the year 1807. In referring to the dissolution of 1784, an insinuation had been advanced against a noble relation of his (the marquis of Buckingham), now absent from the house. With regard to that noble marquis, his conduct had always appeared to him so pure and unimpeachable, that he might take it upon him to say, that there was no act of his life, of which he (lord G.) as a relative and a man would not be proud. Respecting the dissolution of the year 1784, and that of 1807, there was, as had already been shewn, a very wide difference. The grounds for the former dissolution arose from a serious difference between the two houses of parliament. It, therefore, became an indispensible measure. Was there a similar reason now? No. Had there existed any difference between the two houses, regard-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0316"/>
<col>603</col>
ing the confidence in his majesty's present ministers? No. There was no idea entertained of withdrawing public confidence from ministers. The alarm was therefore ill-founded. Was it not dangerous to expose parliament to the contempt or derision of the people, by a dissolution for which there was no cause, whether considered as to manner or time? Certainly. The more confidence the people reposed in parliament, the greater became the respectability of parliament. One noble lord had spoken in favour of annual parliaments; but such a dissolution as that lately experienced was even shorter than annual parliaments&#x2014;scarcely half of that period. He was a friend to rational liberty, but he was an enemy, to every measure which would tend to the introduction of anarchy or confusion. Annual parliaments might in the minds of some men have their attractions; but he, for his part, was not friendly to such a system of representation. Annual parliaments would not only be troublesome and burthensome to the people, but by no means productive of the advantages which were promised from the imaginations of some projectors. He denied the truth of a noble lord's hypothesis, that the dissolution of 1806 was no more justifiable than that of 1807. If seriously and gravely asked what period he would sooner select than that of any other for the dissolution, he would answer, that of the year 1806, because the minds of the people were not in a state of fermentation from the agitation of any particular measure. From every view of the dissolution of the year 1806, he had not only no cause to regret it, but was confident the act was approved of universally. With regard to the postponement of the private business by the last dissolution, ministers had been guilty of a gross breach of faith with individuals. If ancient forms be necessary in the conduct of parliament, why was the latter taken by surprize? Why supersede the common usages of parliament? If forms or usages be outraged, there is not only an end at once of parliament, but an end of the responsibility of ministers. Such wanton abuse of power not only called aloud for condemnation, but also for reform. His lordship, among the enumeration of several acts which had severely suffered by the interruption in consequence of the dissolution of parliament, mentioned the measure which he had the honour of proposing for the better administration of justice in Scotland. It, had been universally acknowledged
<col>604</col>
by intelligent men, that abuses existed in the administration of justice there, which ought to be reformed. The bill to which he alluded, he proposed to submit again to the consideration of their lordships in the course of a few days. Let ministers then take care of their characters, for he would do his duty. Among other gross inconveniences which would arise from the dissolution, was the serious interruption or blow which the revenue of Ireland would receive. The bill for the management of that revenue expired on the 5th of July. The revenue must either cease to be raised, or those concerned in its collection, must be guilty of a violation of the constitution. Another criminal violation of law and the constitution arose from a certain act between America and this country being now about to expire: the duties, therefore, on shipments of goods from America to this country, could not by law be collected. Did ministers know that the act expired on the 1st of July? They ought not surely to plead ignorance, as a reference to the expiring acts on the journals of the house of commons would inform them of the serious fact. His lordship wished to learn how far, ministers would be justified in the collection of the revenue arising either from American goods, or in Ireland? It was not merely for refusing to pay ship money that Hampben sustained a trial, but to ascertain whether or not he lived in a free country. If acts of revenue be allowed to be suspended one month, why not six? If six, why not twelve months? Some might say, that they lived in a free country, but they might with some propriety affirm, when referring to these outrages of the law, that it was not so. These are the chief grounds, said the noble lord, on which I think that his majesty's ministers have been guilty of criminal misconduct. Has the outcry of "No Popery" answered the purpose of ministers? It certainly has not, for those who were deluded have returned to their sober reason. Have ministers been guilty of exciting these outcries and prejudices? We have not as yet heard any of them disclaim the charge. But the people have long ere now discovered the imposition upon their credulity. Therefore his lordship ironically wished to learn, how his majesty's ministers meant to acquit or justify themselves on the occasion? Had they acknowledged their faults or deceptions to their constituents? He wished to know if the Chancellor of the University of Oxford had written to his constituents, the members of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0317"/>
<col>605</col>
the University, acknowledging his mistake or delusion in giving them a false alarm? Had his majesty's chancellor of the exchequer written to his constituents of Northampton, acknowledging his error? Had he declared that all the hand bills of "No Popery," &amp;c. were not sanctioned by his signature, but were forgeries? Had he assured his constituents, that no cause had ever existed for their fears and alarms? Had the Chancellor of the University of Dublin (the Duke of Cumberland) written to his constituents, acknowledging not only the forgery imposed upon him and the London Gazette, which had caused the strange <i>erratum</i> that some days ago appeared in that paper, but acknowledging also the delusion which had nearly frightened the members of that respectable University from their propriety ?&#x2014;His lordship said he had been told that the Secretary of State had received an address conveying sentiments of a very illiberal nature, saying that the catholics ought not to be trusted with arms. He hoped it was not true that such a dangerous address had been presented from any incorporated body whatever. His lordship expressed his surprize how it could be possible for the noble viscount to mistake the import of that part of the speech in which mention is made of the expedition to Turkey; and he would put it to any noble lord whether he believed that the person who framed the paragraph alluded to, did it merely for the purpose of detailing the facts, or whether they did not believe in their hearts it was done for the purpose of misrepresentation? He was far from wishing to avoid inquiry and investigation. On the contrary, he wished ardently for the arrival of the period when whispers could be circuculated with comparatively as little avail as garbled publications. He desired only, in justice to the characters of those naval and military persons employed, that judgment should be withheld until their details of the transactions were before them. In prosecuting inquiry he would afford every assistance in his power. He wished that the whole subject might be brought under investigation without reserve, for he knew of none that was necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth rose</member> <membercontribution>to explain. He said that he had read over the paragraph alluded to by the noble baron with the greatest care and attention, and he did not find one sentence which appeared to convey blame on the advisers of that expedition.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>persisted that the
<col>606</col>
communication from the throne implied no censure on the conduct of his majesty's late ministers; while, on the contrary, his majesty's present government was stigmatised by the amendment, which accused them of manifest misconduct. He adverted to what had been said respecting the difference of one or two words in the speech which were in fact clerical errors, and not originally intended. No part of the speech called for a parliamentary approbation of the recent measure of dissolution. He was free to say, that it was undoubtedly the right of that house, when they thought such proceedings went upon constitutional grounds, to impute blame to those ministers who advised the act of dissolving parliament. But no question of that sort arose from the tenor of the speech. But on this head particularly the address meant to arraign the conduct of ministers. In the case of last year, there was no reason whatever, assigned for the measure of dissolution; though it was the more requisite, as the parliament before the last was dissolved after a proclamation had been actually issued for its meeting on a particular day for the dispatch of business. For the recent case, he only asked of the noble baron to support it on the same principle he had supported the dissolution in 1784. His lordship then adverted to those measures of the late ministers which more immediately led to the change. And particularly adverting to the ministerial change, he observed, if it were presumed that from the act of taking office, the present had advised the dismissal of the late ministers, then the former were responsible; but such a conclusion he was not disposed to admit. He concluded by saying, that the measure of the recent dissolution was warranted by the necessity of the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>reprobated the late dissolution additionally for the critical time in which it took place, which aggravated its injurious consequences. His lordship took occasion to advert to the indignity which had been offered to his royal highness the Prince of Wales, in the proceedings on the Scots Peers election, when the annunciation of his proxies were not received in the customary respectful manner. Had he fortunately been there, he should have noticed such a pointed omission in a proper manner: he added, that disrespect could not be shewn to any one branch of the royal family, without at the same time reflecting on the august head of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>defended what he had
<image src="S1V0009P0I0318"/>
<col>607</col>
said in the last session against the dissolution of 1806; which, he argued, was called for by no necessity, nor was there any assigned. In the present, ministers proceeded upon great and important grounds. He admitted it was an extraordinary measure of the kind, and that it could be justified only by the special circumstances of the case, by the paramount considerations which would crush all the objections to it, and ministers were prepared to justify it on their responsibility. He expatiated on the primary duty of preserving the constitution of the country in church and state, as by a succession of laws established. He adverted to a publication not long since by a Roman Catholic in Ireland, (sir John Throckmorton) in which, among other points which shewed the views and dispositions of a part, at least, of the Roman Catholics of that country, a proposition was broached of the propriety and justice of appointing Catholics and Protestants alternately to the Bishops' sees in that country. Surely that was enough to induce the British government to pause, and seriously reflect as to its conduct with respect to them. He had a favourable opinion of the Irish; they were an open-hearted, liberal people, and had his majesty's late ministers candidly stated to the Catholic part of them at once, that beyond a certain point they could not concede, they would have been more pleased and satisfied with it, than with the line of proceeding they had thought proper to adopt. With respect to the conduct of his majesty, with regard to that great question, if ever the public opinion in this country was clearly pronounced, it was pronounced upon that occasion. There were some political considerations with respect to the empire, which should be immutable, and not subject to variation as subordinate laws; such were its religion and its constitution.<lb/>
The question was then put, and a division took place, when there appeared, for the amendment&#x2014;

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-06-26">Friday, June 26.</date>
<p>At three o'clock Mr. Quarme yeoman usher of the black rod, appeared at the bar, and in the name of the lords authorised by virtue of his majesty's commission, required the immediate attendance of the commons in the house of peers, to hear the commission read. The Speaker, and nearly all the members present, attended. On their return, the Speaker having informed the house, that the clerk had, according to custom, prepared a bill to prevent clandestine outlawry, the same was read a first, and ordered to be read a second time. The grand committees for religion, for courts of justice, and for trade, and the committee of privileges were appointed. The customary resolutions relative to the term of limitation for petitions complaining of undue returns, and the standing orders of the house were read and agreed to.</p>
<p><member>THE LORD COMMISSIONERS' SPEECH.]&#x2014;The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>then acquainted the house, that that house had been in the house of peers, where the lords authorised by his majesty's commission had delivered a speech to both houses of parliament, of which, to prevent mistakes, he had obtained a copy. (See p. 577)&#x2014;After the Speaker had read the speech,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Newark rose</member> <membercontribution>and addressed the house as follows:&#x2014;In rising, sir, to move an Address of thanks to his majesty for his most
<image src="S1V0009P0I0319"/>
<col>609</col>
gracious Speech from the throne, I cannot but feel a considerable degree of solicitude and embarrassment, from the apprehension of my not being able to acquit myself as ought, in the arduous task I have undertaken. Conscious as I am, that I have but little pretensions to warrant me in such an act of presumption, as that of troubling this house with my sentiments, I feel more peculiarly the force of this difficulty, when I have to address you on a question, which may probably occasion a very important am interesting discussion. This consideration sir, would have prompted me to decline the honor I now have of presenting myself to your notice, had I not been encouraged by this indulgence uniformly shewn by this house to every gentleman who has offered himself under similar circumstances. With this impression on my mind, I shall not, sir presume to trespass long on the patience of the house, while I beg leave to call its attention to the leading points of his majesty's most gracious speech, and to request its concurrence in the address of thanks I shall have the honour to move. It is unnecessary for me, sir, to enter at any length into the circumstances which led to the dissolution of the last parliament, as those circumstance have repeatedly been discussed in this house, and are now become the subject of public notoriety. I am the more disposed to avoid any such discussion, as it must necessarily involve points on which I am aware there is a great difference of opinion. His majesty has, in his wisdom, thought it expedient to avail himself of the only constitutional mode of collecting the sense of his people, by dissolving the late parliament, and by calling that which is now convened. By this measure, this house is now become the organ of expressing the public opinion; and I trust we shall, if not by our unanimous vote this night, at least by a considerable majority, prove, not only our affectionate attachment to his majesty's person and government, but also to those sound constitutional principles, expressed, as they have been, in the many loyal and dutiful addresses presented at the foot of the throne. The country, sir, has, beyond all question, shewn its determination to support his majesty in the exercise of the rightful prerogatives of the crown, and in his efforts to withstand every unconstitutional innovation. Need I advert, sir, in support of nay argument, to that recent instance of his patriotism, to that paternal solicitude and regard for the best interests of his Protestant subjects, which has endeared him to
<col>610</col>
us more than any other act of his long eventful reign ? While this, sir, is yet fresh in our recollection, can this house withhold its tribute of gratitude to him, for having thus approved himself as the watchful guardian of our constitutional rights, and as the faithful and patriot sovereign of a loyal and affectionate people?&#x2014;His majesty, having expressed to us his solicitude to cultivate among his allies on the continent that mutual good understanding and confidence so essential to the success or the common cause, next calls our attention to his ineffectual attempt to mediate between Russia and the Porte, and to the hostilities with the latter power, in which it has been the necessary cause of involving him. He laments, as we have all to lament, in two unfortunate instances, the failure or the gallant efforts of his navy and army, and the loss of so many of his brave and valuable subjects. These reverses are I trust, but partial and temporary; and it would be in vain to hope for uninterrupted success, in so extensive a scale of military operations, as that in which we are engaged. His majesty next appeals to the loyalty and zeal of his faithful commons, for their furnishing such farther supplies, as may be necessary for the public service; and expresses his conviction of the necessity of a careful and economical administration of them. I am willing to flatter myself, and moreover to believe, that the same laudable principle will influence the conduct of his majesty's confidential servants; and am happy to hear, that those inquiries into the public expenditure, which were prosecuted in the last parliament, will be revived in this. I shall now, sir, detain the house no longer with my observations, than while I make a remark on the conclusion of his majesty's speech. He calls on us to cherish among ourselves a spirit of union and harmony; and when, I would ask, was ever such a suggestion more seasonable, or more impressive? We have still an arduous conflict to sustain, we have to withstand and counteract the hostility of a powerful, inveterate, and rancorous foe; and have surely need of all our united energies for the attainment of a secure and honourable peace. I shall conclude with moving, "That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, humbly thanking his majesty for the most gracious speech which the lords commissioners have read by his majesty's command: to return his majesty our cordial thanks for having, in conformity to his declared intention, caused the present parliament to be assembled without loss of time, after having deem-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0320"/>
<col>611</col>
ed it expedient, at so important a moment, to recur to the sense of his people: to express our sincere satisfaction at hearing that, since the events which led to the dissolution of the last parliament, his majesty has received, in numerous Addresses from his subjects, the warmest assurances of their affectionate attachment to his person and government, and of their firm resolution to support him in maintaining the just rights of his crown, and the true principles of the constitution; and to assure his majesty that we shall be disposed to afford him our most zealous and affectionate support under all the arduous circumstances of the present time: to express to his majesty our warmest acknowledgements of his majesty's wisdom and goodness, in having most anxiously employed his endeavours for the purpose of drawing closer the ties by which his majesty is connected with the powers of the continent, of assisting the efforts of those powers against the ambition and oppression of France, of forming such engagements as may ensure their continued co operation, and of establishing that mutual confidence and concert so essential, under any course of events, to the restoration of a solid and permanent peace in Europe: to assure his majesty, that it would have afforded us the greatest pleasure to have heard that the mediation undertaken by his majesty for the purpose of preserving peace, between his majesty's ally the emperor of Russia and the Sublime Porte, had proved effectual to that important object: and to concur with his majesty in deeply regretting the failure of that mediation, accompanied as it was by the disappointment of the. efforts of his majesty's squadron in the sea of Marmora, and followed as it has since been by the losses which have been sustained by his gallant troops in Egypt: to assure his majesty, that we should have lamented the extension of hostilities in any quarter which should create a diversion in the war so favourable to the views .of France; but that we lament it especially in "the instance of a power with which his majesty has been so closely connected, and, which has been so recently indebted for its protection against the encroachments of France to the signal and successful interposition of his majesty's arms; and that we hear, with satisfaction, that his majesty has thought it right to adopt such measures as might best enable him, in concert with the emperor of Russia, to take advantage of any favourable opportunity for bringing the hostilities in which they are engaged against the
<col>612</col>
Sublime Porte to a conclusion consistent with his majesty's honour, and the interests of his ally: to assure his majesty, that his faithful commons will cheerfully make such provision for the public service, as well as for the, further application of the sums which were granted in the last parliament, as may appear to be necessary: that we are deeply sensible of his majesty's paternal goodness, in constantly bearing in mind the necessity of a careful and economical administration of the pecuniary resources of the country; and that he may rely upon our proceeding, without delay, in the pursuit of those enquiries connected with the public economy, which engaged the attention of the last parliament: to assure his majesty, that we are deeply impressed with the peculiar importance at the present moment of cherishing a spirit of union and harmony amongst his people, satisfied as we are that such a spirit will most effectually promote the prosperity of the country at home, will give vigour and efficacy to its councils and its arms abroad, and can alone enable his majesty, under the blessing of Providence, to carry on successfully the great contest in which he is engaged, or finally to conduct it to that termination which his majesty's moderation and justice have ever led him to seek&#x2014;a peace in which the honour and interests of his kingdom can be secure, and in which Europe and the world may hope for independence and repose."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hall</member> <membercontribution>seconded the motion for the address. Although the noble lord had anticipated, him in most points, he would shortly submit to the house the considerations which induced him to do so. Parliament had been assembled at an important crisis: the country looked with extreme anxiety to the result of their deliberations. They were called upon to discuss subjects of the utmost consequence; .and by their wisdom and judgment to give effect and direction to the exertions of the people, as well as to secure and augment their constitutional rights. They were also called upon to express their sense of the firmness with which, under peculiar difficulties, his majesty had asserted the just rights of the constitution, and of those establishments which were the foundation of our civil and religious liberties. The prerogative which his majesty had recently exercised, was one of the most important that belonged to the crown; and the propriety of its exercise could be estimated only by a deliberate consideration of the necessity, by which it was demanded. Under a due sense of political and religious considerations, his
<image src="S1V0009P0I0321"/>
<col>613</col>
majesty felt himself compelled firmly to combat those whom he had but lately called to his councils, and to oppose his <i>veto</i> to the measures which they were desirous of introducing. But this was, not all; it had been said in another place, that the king could have no conscience, but what was in the keeping of his Confidential ministers. What monstrous conclusion was to be drawn from this extraordinary assertion! The voice of the people had been sufficiently expressed by the general concurrence, which dictated addresses to his majesty from every part of the kingdom. The measure proposed by the late administration was uncalled for, and unwise. Uncalled for, because it had been lately discussed, and rejected by a large majority of parliament; unwise, because it tended to raise hopes which could not be realized. The refusal of his majesty to accede to this measure prevented the gradual abolition of those land-marks in the constitution, Which were necessary to its existence. In this country there must be religious distinction, and the catholics must be contented with the share of political power which they now enjoyed: and, therefore, by the measure which they proposed, the late ministers lost the confidence of the king, nod as it immediately appeared, forfeited the approbation of the house. His majesty had since had recourse to the abilities of those, who had been intimately connected with that great statesman Mr. Pitt, whom he could not but consider as the only pilot to other ministers; that man who, amidst all the dangers by Which he was surrounded,rose in firmness in proportion to the exigencies of the times, and left that constitution which he loved and protected; unimpaired by the attacks of either foreign or domestic foes. To those who long fought under his banners, the country must now look for direction. They had advised his majesty to refer to the general sense of the people, in order that they might present themselves to the enemy as possessing the confidence of a brave nation and to the allies of Great Britain, as ready to afford them the necessary support. By the promptitude of their measures they had already shewn themselves adequate to the duty in which they had been engaged. By such measures alone could effect be given to any negotiation which might lead to a successful termination of the present contest. Yet notwithstanding all that he asserted, the dissolution of the last parliament had been attributed to the earnest desire of his majesty's ministers, to
<col>614</col>
smother the labours of the Committee of Finance; but his Majesty's speech proved that they were as much interested in the continuance of that committee, as the gentlemen opposite. So far from wishing to smother it, they advised his majesty to applaud the institution of it by the last parliament, and to recommend that it should be renewed by the present. Under all these circumstances, he was not sanguine enough to expect that this address would be unanimously acceded to, but he called on the gentlemen opposite who had quitted the helm of state, to feel for the situation of the country. The people were duly sensible of the justice of the cause in which the country were engaged, and he had no doubt that they would cheerfully submit to the sacrifices that would be necessary for the prosecution of it. He trusted their. efforts might be effectually directed to secure the advantages which we already possessed, and to enable us successfully to oppose that system of aggression which threatened the downfal of every independent state in Europe. In this object all parties were equally interested. Our country was at stake; and he trusted that but one opinion could exist with regard to the exertions necessary for its defence.&#x2014;The Speaker having read the Address,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>declared, that before he required of the gentlemen opposite, some exposition of their opinions as to the situation of the country at home and abroad, and something in explanation of those&#x2014;what should, he call them? charges and insinuations; there were in His Majesty's Speech itself, as well as in the speeches of the gentlemen opposite, and particularly of the last, passages so extraordinary, that even in this stage of the debate, he could not defer calling the attention of the house to them, arid demanding the justice, which his majesty's late ministers had a right to claim, namely; that if those passages were meant as charges, they should be fairly brought forward; that if as insinuations, they should be made clear. The noble lord by whom the address wan proposed, and the hon. gent. by whom it was seconded, had concluded their speeches in the same way in which his majesty's speech concluded&#x2014;and here once for all he begged to be considered as deeming his majesty's speech the speech of the Ministers by whom it was advised, and who alone were responsible for its contents; and, however severe the expressions which he might find it his duty to use on this subject, he trusted they would not be miscon-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0322"/>
<col>615</col>
strued into any thing derogatory from that respect which, as a faithful subject of the king, and which as possessing a perfect confidence in his virtues, he was always ready to pay. But the noble lord and the hon. seconder had concluded their speeches as his majesty's speech concluded, by calling for unanimity. In one point alone he feared that he could agree with them. He agreed with them that there never was a more awful crisis; that the country was never in greater danger; and that there never was a greater call for unanimity and co-operation, if unanimity and co-operation could be obtained: but, at the time when they called for unanimity, they followed closely the, example of the speech, or rather of the ministers by whom that speech was advised. While the word unanimity was on their lips, they introduced topics, which must necessarily produce division. They had called the attention of the house to the late dissolution of parliament, and both bad contended, that the power of dissolving parliament was an indisputable prerogative of the crown, given for the advantage of the subjects; but neither of these gentlemen had stated that this, like every other prerogative, was subject in its exercise to be considered by parliament. The noble lord had commenced by saying, that he would not allude to the circumstances that led to the late dissolution of parliament; but in the progress of his speech he forgot this determination; he had stated, that the measures which produced; the dissolution had imperiously called on his majesty to step forward in defence of the Protestant establishment. The hon. seconder had gone more at length into this part of the subject. According to him, not the introduction alone of the measure which had been alluded to, but its introduction and subsequent abandonment, had necessarily demanded the exercise of the prerogative, as exemplified in the dissolution. For himself, he confessed, that he had scarcely as yet recovered from the astonishment which that measure had occasioned. Had it been adopted by any. other administration than the present, he could not have accounted for it on any principle of public security or national welfare; but coming from the gentlemen opposite, it was indeed extraordinary! Not a long,time had elapsed since parliament was before dissolved. On that occasion the house had heard a great number of observations from the gentlemen opposite. If human imagination, had, been tortured to devise,a combination of circumstances, which
<col>616</col>
should expose this prerogative of the crown to all the objections that had been then urged against it, it could not have been more successful than in the present instance. The hon. gent. reprehended the dissolution of parliament after it had been sitting four years; they themselves dissolved a parliament after it had been assembled only four months. The hon. gent. opposite censured the dissolution which took place at the end of a session; they themselves dissolved parliament in the middle of a session. The hon. gent. opposite had complained of undue influence having been exerted against them; they themselves had exercised an influence not in the detail, but in wholesale, and such as they ought to have been ashamed of. Unless parliament were to say at once, that the prerogatives of the crown ought to be curtailed, and that parliament should be rendered permanent, it could, never be contended that any dissolution was better timed than that which took place under his majesty's late ministers. At the end of a negotiation which left little hope of a peace, it was surely adviseable to shew the enemy and the allies of the country, that the king, the parliament and the people, were determined to unite in withstanding all the efforts of an unrelenting enemy. Never did greater unanimity prevail than on that occasion, interrupted only by those personal and local differences, which every general election must necessarily produce, But the hon. gent. opposite, by the dissolution which they advised, had created an infinity of public and private inconveniences; they had produced the utmost disunion, and instead of uniting the people, they had, as far as in them lay, kindled religious animosities, set man against man, and brother against brother: they had set the people of Ireland against the people of England, by shewing the great body of the Irish that the English were unfavourable to their claims. Such conduct would be at any time criminal; but when it was considered, with reference to the necessity that existed for making a due impression on our allies, it became still more so. Could this be denied? Let the house look at the state of the public business when parliament was dissolved. In the first place, there were in the last session a greater number of private bills, tending to improve the agriculture, increase the manufactures, and extend the commerce of the country, than in any former parliament. Those bills, by the regulations which he (lord Howick) had
<image src="S1V0009P0I0323"/>
<col>617</col>
had the honour to propose, under the advice of the highest authority in that house, had been brought almost to the last stage. On the 27th of April, the dissolution took place; on the 11th of May the reports upon those bills would have been received: the consequence was, that the greater part of the expenses attending them had been paid, and that they then had fallen to the ground. What expedient was to be resorted to in this case, he knew not; he should be glad to that individuals could be relieved from inconveniences occasioned by the misconduct of his majesty's ministers. But the house must be careful that in remedying a private inconvenience, they did not open a door to public evil, and afford facilities to subsequent ministers to dissolve a parliament, without having a stronger necessity for the dissolution, than what had been described by the noble lord and the hon. gent. opposite. So much for private inconvenience: with respect to public business, many useful measures had been depending on the dissolution; some might be resumed; others could not. The Reversion bill was one, perhaps, which might again be brought in. His noble friend's finance plan, good faith to the public creditor demanded should be speedily discussed and renewed. With respect to the Finance Committee, the hon. seconder seemed to be surprised that ministers should be supposed to have any wish to stop inquiry. Without imputing to the ministers any such wish, this he knew; that the dissolution had impeded the progress of the committee, and that there was no likelihood of its labours being completed in the present session. It was a Committee of Enquiry; and if many new members should be added, to it, they would, perhaps, not arrive at the result which the last committee had reached, without a fresh investigation of the evidence. As the committee was to be revived, he trusted that, as nearly as could be, the same members would be appointed, and that the would be chosen openly and not by ballot; in this case, they might, perhaps, prosecute the chief objects of their enquiry with effect, notwithstanding the serious interruption which they had experienced. With respect to the members of which the committee was to be composed, some facts had been lately developed in the fourth Report of the Commissioners of Military Inquiry, which might render necessary some change in the members. Still more, on the 27th of April, parliament was dissolved; on the 24th of April, there had been alarming accounts laid on the
<col>618</col>
table, of the finances of the East India Company. What time gentlemen opposite purposed to do, he knew not. It had been in he contemplation of his majesty's late ministers, to propose some expedient by which the company might have been relieved without imposing any additional burdens on the people. The proposition having been made, it might have remained a subject for consideration until the next session of parliament; but by the course which his majesty's present ministers pursued, in not proposing any measure before the 27th April, and thus by allowing no time for investigation, they had reduced themselves to the necessity of adopting, at present, almost any thing which offered itself. With regard to the state of the supplies at time dissolution, the necessary votes for the different services, and the sanction which his noble friends plan had obtained, nearly set that subject at rest; but still the Irish money bills had not been passed, and the consequence was, that there was not now sufficient time to pass those bills (the Irish Custom bill in particular); consistent with those forms which parliament had wisely provided, and which never yet had been departed from. Either the Collection of that part of the revenue must be suspended, or the forms of parliament must be violated; a circumstance which he strongly deprecated. Should ministers take upon themselves to collect without the authority of law, a tax on the people of Ireland, they would be highly reprehensible. At the dissolution too, none of the sums which had been voted for the public service, were appropriated, for no appropriation act had been passed. Without such an act, by a solemn principle of the constitution, the application of those sums to particular services, was not constitutional or legal. He readily allowed that there might be, situations in which a government ought to act without the support of law, when the state service required its suspension; but then these situations must be unforeseen and inevitable. If a ministry, with their eyes open, placed themselves in a situation in which, on the one hand the law must be broken, or on the other the country must be endangered, the exercise of their discretion, in such a case, called for the most solemn consideration of parliament. And; for what purpose had all these mischiefs been. occasioned? The hon. seconder had stated, that an attempt had been made by the late ministry to force the conscience of the king, an assertion completely unfounded in fact.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0324"/>
<col>619</col>
Having declared that there were acts of the royal prerogative which were personal and unadvised, and having thus brought his majesty into a state of responsibility, the hon. gent. maintained, that the late ministry had arraigned their king, and had asked the house of commons to pronounce him guilty or not guilty. While he possessed the power of speech, he would protest against a principle so fatal to liberty of debate, as that upheld by the hon gent. If the house were canvassing any proceeding of government, were they to be stopped by being told, that it was the act not of the ministry but of the monarch? If so, then farewell to all freedom of deliberation, and farewell to the personal security of the monarch himself; for, however convenient such a doctrine might at the moment appear, the consequences of it were too obvious to need illustration. A dissolution of parliament must always be inconvenient, and at that period of the session at which the late dissolution took place, more inconvenient than at any other. In the interesting debate on this subject, which took place in the year 1784, an opinion was quoted of lord Somers's that his majesty, during a session of parliament, had no power to dissolve the parliament. With all the deference which was due to the abilities of so able a lawyer, and so great a statesman, he confessed that he differed greatly from lord Somers on this point. The strongest necessity might, in his opinion, exist for a dissolution, during a session of parliament, namely, such a difference between the two houses, as should impede the progress of public business. Still however this assertion of lord Somers's was sufficient to shew the extreme inconvenience that resulted from a dissolution in the midst of a session, and that such a measure ought not to he resorted to without the most urgent necessity. Now, what necessity existed in the present instance? The hon. seconder declared that the late ministers had proposed measures replete with danger to the protestant establishment. What then? Those ministers had been turned out: the hon. gent. had himself stated, they had lost the confidence of parliament. What interruption therefore Was expedient? What necessity was there for a dissolution? The house were now told, that they were called together merely for a month, to wind up the business of the last parliament, and then to be sent home. If a month would be sufficient for that purpose in the present parliament a month would have been sufficient
<col>620</col>
for it in the last. His majesty's late minister's would scarcely have objected to their own measures, No necessity, therefore, did exist. Why, then, did they take this step? In order that an appeal should be made to the people, as it was stated in his majesty's speech, while recent events were fresh in their recollection; in other words, during the prevalence of that base cry, which, it was hoped, would have an influence on the elections. He defied any other interpretation to be made of this proceeding; although, in his majesty's speech, there was something like an attempt at this, and in the noble lord's address much more. In his majesty's speech, parliament was called upon to support him "in maintaining the just rights of his crown, and the true principles of the constitution." This passage was completely explained by the conduct of ministers, as evinced in their advertisements and publications, and in the speeches of tonight, the only purpose of which seemed to be, to excite that division in the country, which, if it were not produced, was owing to the good sense of the people, and not to the prudent conduct of administration. When the house recollected all that had been said about the Coronation Oath, was it not manifest to them, that an attempt had been made to alarm the nation, with an idea that the late administration had endeavoured to force the conscience of the king. As to the measure proposed having been incompatible with the Coronation Oath, no such apprehension Could be entertained by any one whose mind was larger than the mind of a child. Did the learned gent. opposite mean to say, that any measure favourable to the catholics would be against the Coronation Oath? Did he mean to say, because the king had sworn to maintain the Protestant Religion as by law established, that it would be contrary to the Coronation Oath, if certain absurd penal statutes existed injurious to sectaries; to repeal them? Such a senseless proposition no one could support; for what had been the effect of the repeal of similar statutes in Ireland? If therefore the learned gent. opposite renounced such doctrines, why introduce this passage into his majesty's speech, but for the purpose of taking advantage of the alarm which it must occasion? The thing was most absurd: if the last liaise of commons had carried the bill which he had proposed to them, there might have been some plea for this expression; but as that bill had been withdrawn, how could his majesty's ministers
<image src="S1V0009P0I0325"/>
<col>621</col>
with common decency assert, that the dissolution had been rendered necessary "for the maintenance of the just rights of the crown, and the true principle of the constitution." He would ask them, did they seriously believe that this limited extension endangered either the welfare of the kingdom, or the safety of the constitution he wished the hon. seconder had, in his observations on the subject, consulted the feelings of those gentlemen below him. Although he (lord Howick) should belie the whole of his political life, if he were to consider Mr. Pitt as the extraordinary statesman which he had been represented to have been by the hon. gent. he was yet aware that he possessed great qualities and splendid talents; and he could have wished, that the hon. gent. had not passed such a severe censure upon him as he had done, in asserting that any person who proposed indulgencies to the Roman catholics, was guilty of an attempt to undermine the protestant establishment of the country. On this subject he could with confidence appeal to the recollection of the house, whether an extension of privileges to the catholics had not been supported by Mr. Pitt, Mr Fox, and Mr. Burke, three men, whose talents, whose wisdom, and whose experience, were as great, or perhaps greater, than those of any triumvirate that ever existed. The present government was composed of the followers of Mr. Pitt, and therefore the hon. gent. had cast a censure on the living as well as on the dead. For his part, when he called to his mind the former conduct of the individuals of his majesty's present administration, he could not but wonder, after the cry that they had endeavoured to raise, how they could come down to that house with countenances unbalanced with fear and shame. To speak frankly&#x2014;for to speak frankly was indispensable at such a crisis as the present&#x2014;when he recollected the conduct of the learned gent. in 1801, at which time he did not think any interference in the protestant establishment necessary&#x2014;when he recollected his conduct in 1801, on the introduction of a measure much more extensive than that proposed by the late administration, he could not but be persuaded that the learned gent. did not believe in the existence of the dangers, the apprehension of which he had contributed to diffuse. On the same principle, when he recollected the measures which had been recommended by the noble lord opposite (lord Castlereagh) as necessary to the tranquility of Ireland; when he recollected the declaration of that noble
<col>622</col>
lord, that Ireland ,could not be governed without some concession of that nature; when he recollected that the noble lord had pledged himself to the execution of the measure; that for that pledge he received a valuable consideration; that by it he was enabled to complete the union of the two kingdoms; when he recollected these things, and considered the consequences that might have resulted in Ireland from the failure of the measure which he had proposed, his astonishment had not ceased. Serious, indeed, would those consequences have been, had the attempts which had been lately made to infuse into the people of England a rancorous animosity against the catholics of Ireland succeeded; had they made England a kind of Orange Party against the Irish, and taught the Irish that not trifling difficulties alone stood in the way of their claims, but the general and united opposition of the whole country. By the public declarations and advertisements in all parts of the kingdom, not excepting Northampton, the late administration had been arraigned as personally opposed to the king, and the people were called upon to decide between them and their sovereign. Never before did, a proceeding take place so injurious to the repose even of the royal person himself! To the sentiments avowed by the present administration, he had three distinct and decided objections. The first ,was, that they had declared the unconstitutional doctrine, that the king could act without any adviser; the second, that they had violated the freedom of election; indeed, within these few days, similar influence had been endeavoured to be extended to the present question, and it had been asserted, that whoever voted on the address against the wish of the present ministers would vote against his majesty, and bring him to trial: his last objection was, that they had endangered the personal security of the king himself. This was the first time that,his majesty had ever been advised to make a personal appeal to the people; and however convenient at the moment, it was a precedent which might hereafter lead to the most fatal consequences. If any thing could aggravate the conduct of his majesty's government, it was that these very men, who before opposed a dissolution at a favourable period should dare to advise his majesty to dissolve parliament in the midst of a session, and then assert, that no material inconvenience would result to the public service. With respect to the influence of the crown, it had been exercised during the last election, in a most unex-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0326"/>
<col>623</col>
ampled manner. In this country to a great degree, but in, the sister kingdom most unblushingly, both in temptation and in threats. In one borough Ireland, a candidate had dared a single elector to vote against him; and he had been told, that in another popular contest the crown solicitor had gone down, and informed Mr. Grogan, that the forfeiture of his estates would be enforced, unless he and all his tenantry voted for the partisans of government. But there was another mode of influence of public notoriety, which he would mention: it was the letter, dated the 25th of April, from lord Hawkesbury to the lords lieutenants of counties respecting the volunteers. Lord Hawkesbury stated, that it was intended to propose to parliament, to restore their pay to such volunteers as came in after a certain period, and also to re-appoint the inspecting;field officers; which last he (lord Howick) understood, had since been done. Now, let the house consider the date of this letter. On the 25th of April, the secretary of state declares, that it was intended to propose a Certain measure to parliament. In two days afterwards parliament is prorogued, previous to its immediate dissolution; so that the noble secretary must have known, that he deprived himself of the power of proposing the measure by advising the dissolution. The restoration of the inspecting field officers was a most objectionable step. He had never met with a single Volunteer officer who did not hold these Inspecting Officers in the utmost contempt: they had no command: they were not even empowered to order the Volunteers to come to be inspected. From the large Staff which was attached to the British army; consisting of Adjutants, Quarter-Masters, Brigade-Majors, &amp;c. surely some better inspectors might be selected: aye, but then this was an object of great patronage! Just at the time, of the general election a hundred new offices were to be distributed, and these inspectors of elections, for so they were, in fact, were each to have pay and allowances, making the whole expense to the nation between 37 and 40,000l a year, for no advantage whatever! This was the little beginning of these mighty enemies to patronage: more pure and unadulterated jobs never existed than these appointments&#x2014;There were other parts of his majesty's speech, on the exact purport of which he entertained some doubts, and of which he wished for an explanation. The house was told, "that his majesty's endeavours had been most anxiously employed for
<col>624</col>
the purpose of drawing closer the ties by which his majesty is connected with the powers of the continent; of assisting the efforts of those powers against the ambition and oppression of France; of forming such engagements as may insure their continued co-operation; and of establishing that mutual confidence and concert, so essential under any course of events to the restoration of as solid and permanent peace in Europe". Certainly he, in common with the rest of his majesty's late ministers, felt the necessity of cultivating the connexion, and drawing closer the ties by which his majesty was bound to the powers of the continent as far as was consistent with the security of Great Britain. But he wished to ask whether, by this passage in the speech, it was meant to insinuate, that the late government had neglected to do their duty on this subject? He was more desirous to know this as the subject had been publicly agitated. For his part he declared, that he should be mast glad that every thing which the late ministers had done, in aid of the powers of the continent, should be submitted to the consideration of the house and the public. It would then be found, that no rational effort but been omitted to draw closer the ties of connexion, and more especially between this country and Russia He would boldly and broadly state this, in answer to any assertions that might be hazarded of an opposite tendency. If ministers countenanced any insinuation of this nature, he hoped they would have the manliness openly to avow it. With regard to subsidies to Foreign powers, he thought that there were occasions in which subsidies, and even large subsidies might be advantageously employed; but he also thought that it was most impolitic to give subsidies to Foreign powers, for the purpose of drawing them into a war, into which their own inclinations and interests would not induce them to enter. While, therefore, he stated that the late government had neglected no prudent means of cultivating a connexion with the continental powers, he would also state, that in the present circumstances of this country, and of the world, due care should be taken that any assistance which might be afforded to foreign powers, should not be afforded to those by whom it could not be used at all, or to those by whom it would be misapplied. It was indispensibly incumbent on us to weaken as little as possible the means which we possessed of supporting a protracted contest, (for his majesty's speech had put an end to all apprehension
<image src="S1V0009P0I0327"/>
<col>625</col>
of a separate peace); after 14 years of expensive war, this country had reason to expect that the continent would take a share of its burthens, which its own defence renderer necessary. His majesty's speech contained a paragraph which lamented the rupture between Great Britain and Turkey; and another, which related to the unfortunate events by which it was followed. No one could regret more than he did the causes which produced a division between two powers, whose interests ought to be deemed inseparable. But he asked the hon. gentlemen opposite, if in the manner the subject was mentioned in the speech, it was intended to insinuate in the remotest degree, that the unfortunate rupture with the Porte was to be attributed to the late ministers? He deprecated the mode of introducing this topic into the speech in such a manner, that it could not be discussed without involving in the discussion the conduct of Russia. The late administration were placed in this dilemma, either to suffer the great unfairness which must result from abstaining from any defence, or to defend themselves by calling into question the conduct of Russia, our best ally. As to Turkey, was it meant to be inferred that the late government had asked too much or too little? Whenever the documents (of which his majesty's present ministers were possessed) should be produced, nothing would be found in them inconsistent with the policy of union, moderation, and good faith to Russia and the Porte. Was it meant to charge the late ministry with misconduct on this head? Aye, or No? If so, let there be an inquiry. There were modes of inquiry which prevented disclosures inimical to the public interest; the appointment of a Secret Committee would obviate every difficulty of that nature. If a charge were meant to be made, he owned he was surprised that the charge should proceed from the throne; he deeply regretted the failure of our arms which had been alluded to, but notice of such a failure was totally unprecedented in a speech from the king. After the affairs of the Helder and Ferrol, on the loss of Corsica, and on other disastrous events of the last war, he was not aware that any expressions of regret had been so studiously introduced into his majesty's speech; he must suppose therefore, that in the present instance, they were intended to convey a charge on the late administration. If so, he repeated, that they challenged the strictest inquiry into the destination of the Expedition to Turkey, and
<col>626</col>
into the manner in which that Expedition was arranged; into the original policy an attack on Egypt, and into the mode in which that attack was conducted.&#x2014;Adverting to the changes which he was apprehensive the present administration would make in our military system, he remarked, that by the new arrangements in Scotland, the recruiting had encreased from 26 to 40 per week; and in England considerable benefit had been derived from it, although at the most unfavourable season of the year. He hoped that the gentlemen apposite would not rashly alter his right hon. Friend's plan, but would give it the fair trial to which it was justly entitled. He wished also to know, as soon as it would be convenient to ministers to tell him, what was to be the precise extent of the regulations in the Volunteer. System mentioned by lord Hawkesbury in his letter? He feared they would be expensive. The saving made by his right hon. friend's regulations amounted to 900,000l. a year. .Was it intended to restore some, or all of this? In that case, he should move for new estimates. Above all, he hoped the house and the public would deeply consider the effect of the system of the late administration, and the probable effect of that which would be pursued by the present. If it were still contended, that under the late ministers, the Volunteer system had declined, let evidence be adduced to prove the allegation.&#x2014;The hon. seconder of the address, in alluding to Ireland, had stated, that great danger resulted to that country from the introduction of the measure which he (lord Howick) had had the honour to propose. To him it appeared, that the danger resulted from the failure of the measure, and not from its introduction. He earnestly pressed his majesty's ministers to attend to the advice of an hon. gent. now unfortunately no longer a member of parliament, the late Attorney-General for Ireland (Mr. Plunkett), and to make Ireland the first and the last object of their thoughts. He believed too much anxiety could not be shewn on this subject. He should be glad to hear that some system of conciliation was proposed. He did not allude to any extension of indulgences, but to other regulations which might tranquillize the people. If circumstances of discontent were seized hold of by the enemy, the consequences might be importantly injurious, and against these consequences he wished to guard his majesty's present ministry.&#x2014;Of neutral nations nothing was said in his majesty's speech:
<image src="S1V0009P0I0328"/>
<col>627</col>
when he recollected that the late administration had been told by the gentlemen opposite, that they had sacrificed the navigation laws, and that they had provided inadequate means to resist the French blockading decree of the 21st of September, he was suprised at this omission. He trusted, that the learned gent. opposite would confess, that he had formed an erroneous opinion, and that the latter measure especially, was not quite so inefficient as he had announced it to be. The hon. seconder spoke of the appeal that had been made to the people, and of the multitude of Addresses that had been poured in from every quarter; of the loyalty of those addresses he had no doubt; but if it were meant to insinuate, that in those addresses the people pronounced the late ministers enemies to the king and the Protestant religion, he would appeal from the Addresses to the result of the General Election&#x2014;a result so highly favourable to the late administration, notwithstanding the beastly cry of "No Popery," which had been raised against them. To the present administration he had avowed himself to be an enemy&#x2014;of course, he meant a political enemy only; and yet he would oppose none of their measures which appeared calculated to serve the country. If he was an enemy to an administration engendered in court intrigue; if he was an enemy to an administration composed of men disagreeing with one another; if he was an enemy wan administration which did not possess the confidence of the country; if he was an enemy to an administration, of the first man of whom be would say nothing&#x2014;it was because he was convinced that such an administration was pregnant with the greatest dangers to the king and the constitution.&#x2014;The noble lord concluded by moving an amendment similar to that moved in the House of Lords by earl Fortescue, see p. 582. </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer </member>, <membercontribution>in reply, observed, that, whatever might have beeen the manner in which his majesty's ministers had conic into power, the speech of the noble lord had shewn that it would not meet with his approbation, though he had declared that, in consequence of the state of public affairs, he should give his support to any measures that might be brought forward for the national interest From the manner in which the noble lord had concluded his speech, however, he did not think that he took the proper course to carry that declaration into effect. As the
<col>628</col>
noble lord had introduced a variety of topics into his speech, he should endeavour to follow him through all upon which he had touched, in the best manner he could; and here he could not but observe, that the great object of the noble lord, the sole point to which he seemed to wish to call the attention of the house was, the dissolution of the last parliament. That, with the exception of a few topics introduced towards the conclusion of his speech, of which he should take notice before he sat down, constituted the gravamen of his accusation. The noble lord had thought it necessary to guard himself against any insinuation, that his observations applied to the speech, as the speech of the king and not of his ministers, as if any person could suppose that any other than the king's ministers were responsible for the contents of the speech. The noble lord, however, had admitted, that there could be no doubt of the prerogative of the crown to dissolve the parliament at any time, though he had referred to an authority upon the subject, which he had no sooner quoted than he rejected. But whilst the noble lord had denied the doctrine laid down by lord Somers, he endeavoured to extract out of it a principle that might bear upon the question before them. The propriety of the exercise of the prerogative of the crown in dissolving the parliament, must ever depend upon the circumstances under which such a prerogative might be exercised. In discussing this point, the noble lord had contended, that the prerogative had been properly exercised in the dissolution of the former parliament, but that the late instance of its exercise was founded upon an abandonment of every sound principle upon which that prerogative of the crown ought to be regulated. In the state in which the parliament and the country were placed, when that event took place, his majesty's ministers would not have done their duty, if they had let a moment pass without appealing to the people. It was in that sense of duty he acted, when in conjunction with his colleagues, he had advised his majesty to dissolve the parliament at the earliest moment, when that measure could be resorted to without any material interruption to public business (Hear hear! from the Opposition). He repeated, that it was the duty of his majesty's ministers to advise the dissolution under the existing circumstances. The noble lord had enumerated the circumstances under which that measure was
<image src="S1V0009P0I0329"/>
<col>629</col>
adopted, for the purpose of condemning it; but he was prepared to contend, that these very circumstances were a justification of it. The noble lord had stated, that the parliament had been then but recently chosen, and that that was a reason why it should not have been dissolved; but in his mind the circumstance of its having been so recently chosen, and the circumstances under which it had been elected, were a good ground for the dissolution. The noble lord had argued in support of the preceeding dissolution, that it was necessary to give to our allies; and to Europe, a proof that the king and his government were supported by a united parliament and a united people. The noble lord, whilst in office, with a parliament in which he encountered no formidable opposition, except upon the iron tax, when ministers usually divided in the proportion of two to one against their opponents, felt it necessary to dissolve parliament, in order to shew to Europe that we had a united parliament. But the noble lord could see nothing in the last parliament to justify such a measure; nothing in the manner in which the question that led to it had been brought forward, nor in the manner in which it had been supported; nothing in all these circumstances to shew any ground of apprehension the permanence of government; nothing to shew that his majesty's government might be prevented from the efficient administration of the public affairs. But he would appeal to the house and to the country, if any reason existed on this ground for the dissolution recommended by the noble lord, which was not strengthened and confirmed, as applied to the late measure, by the manner in which it had been opposed. On that ground alone he might rest the necessity of calling a new parliament. But the house must see that this was a question upon which his majesty's ministers must have decided before they came into office, and not after. They were not so blind to the situation in which they would be placed, as not to have made up their minds, in case it should be necessary, to call a new parliament, and to appeal to the sense of the people? What would be the situation of the king, if his ministers had not made this appeal to the sense of his people? Had not his majesty been held up as the sole obstacle to an extension of indulgences to a great portion of his subjects, and against the opinion of his late ministers, who had pressed the measure as indispensably necessary to the interests of the empire? Had
<col>630</col>
not the king been represented as the sole barrier against this measure? Under these circumstances nothing was so necessary to the character of the king as such an appeal to his people, in order to shew that it was not the king alone who was the obstacle to the indulgences, but the great majority of the nation. On these grounds it was, that the dissolution had been resorted to; on these grounds he was convinced that it would appear not to be objectionable. It might be a question, whether such a measure was justifiable at any particular time? And here he must observe, that, if the opinion of the people was to be taken upon the bill introduced by the late ministers; if, upon the measure which had been brought forward avowedly for the purpose of forcing them back into office, it would be most properly done at the nearest possible time, when. those events were still recent in their memory, and whilst they should be able to form their judgment with most accuracy and correctness. The noble lord had objected to a passage in the speech at the close of the last session, which stated that the session was put an end to at a time when that could be done without inconvenience to public business. But that was a question of a relative or comparative nature: he could state, with confidence, that no inconveniences had arisen from the dissolution commensurate with the great importance of calling a new parliament. The noble lord had first adverted to the inconvenience that arose with respect to private bills, and certainly no man could imagine that a dissolution in the middle of a session would not be attended with some inconvenience to the parties, though not to the extent stated by the noble lord. As to the expence, which formed a principal part of that inconvenience, the noble lord would find that means could be devised to render that comparatively light. The expence consisted of the fees of the house, and the cost of witnesses. The former would be obviated by the known liberality of the officers; and as to the expence of witnesses, he had it in intention to make a proposition on Monday, which would do all that away. When he submitted his proposition to the house, it would be his duty to explain the nature of it; for the present, he should only state, that he proposed to refer the proceedings in the former committees to the committees that should now be appointed, in which case, there would be no necessity for the attendance of the witnesses again. As to the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0330"/>
<col>631</col>
inconvenience to the public business, the noble lord appeared to him to be totally mistaken. The noble lord assumed, that in the interval between the two parliaments, public money had been issued as in 1784, without any parliamentary appropriation. As to the fact of the issue of money, the noble lord was mistaken, because no such issue had been made, and he was sure the noble lord would learn with satisfaction, that the public expenditure had been maintained out of the sums appropriated by parliament. [I know what you mean, said lord Howick, in a low tone across the table]. The noble lord had observed, that he knew what he meant, in a manner that led him to conclude, that the noble lord supposed him to be wrong, but he knew himself what he meant, and thought the noble lord mistaken. In each of the bills respecting the English Loan, the Irish Loan, some duties of Excise out of the war taxes, and the additional duty on brandy, there was an appropriating clause, authorising the application of the monies, raised under the respective bills, to certain services voted by parliament. In the issues that had taken place, therefore, the government had acted according to law, and under the authority of parliament. The noble lord had not gone at length into this subject, but he had the authority of that noble lord, so far as silence could be considered an evidence of acquiescence, on the occasion in 1784, that, under certain circumstances, money might be issued by government without a parliamentary appropriation. At any rate, he had the authority of a person to whom that noble lord would not think it a discredit to be compared, the late Mr. Fox, on this head. Before the dissolution in 1784, a resolution had been voted, declaring it illegal to issue money in the event of a dissolution, without a parliamentary appropriation. The dissolution took place, the money was issued, as appeared by accounts moved for and laid on the table in the following session, and yet Mr. Fox never thought of instituting any proceeding upon the subject. The noble lord would not contend that this silence was not an admission of the legality of the act at any rate, the noble lord, who had been at the head of the late government, would not be disposed to disapprove of the course that had been pursued in that instance. A bare resolution of the house was not of any effect after a dissolution or a prorogation, unless taken up in a subsequent session, and confirmed by some legislative enactment, But it might be asked, if these
<col>632</col>
clauses of appropriation were not introduced for the first time last session, of what use was the Appropriation act? That act was intended not alone for the appropriation of sums raised by loans, but other sums not raised in that way, and the preamble of that act stated, that it was for the appropriation of particular sums to particular services, and for the further appropriation of other sums not appropriated by parliament, which implied, that appropriations had been antecedently made during the session.&#x2014;Another inconvenience which the noble lord had stated to arise from the dissolution, was the interruption of the proceedings of the Committee of Finance, which could not in this session be prosecuted to any successful issue. No man could doubt that it was the deliberate determination of the present ministers to revive that committee and undoubtedly there could be no reason why the proceedings of the former committee should not be referred to the revived one. The noble lord had stated, that the committee should consist as nearly as possible of the same members as before, with the exception of the only two members (sir H. Mildmay and Mr. S. Bourne) who, from their parliamentary conduct, could be considered as the friends of the present ministers. (Hear, hear!)&#x2014;There were, undoubtedly, some members in the committee, not connected with either party. This, therefore, would be an extraordinary mode of reviving the committee, and the house would do well to recollect the manner in which that committee had been formed. The hon. gent. who had first proposed the appointment of that committee, (Mr. Biddulph) had met the kind support of the noble lord (H. Petty), who as kindly took the nomination out of his hands! The hon. gent., no doubt, had been appointed on the committee, but when he wished afterwards to have one or two of his friends nominated to it, his application was resisted, because it was indispensable that the committee should consist of 21 members only. Yet, in a few days this imperious necessity vanished, and the noble lord himself proposed the addition of three other members. In this manner it was that this just and enquiring committee had been formed! But it should be remembered that another administration of government had also taken place, whose acts were to be enquired into, and yet the committee was to be composed as before! This, however; would hereafter be subject of discussion, when the committee would be to be revived, and when it
<image src="S1V0009P0I0331"/>
<col>633</col>
would be most seasonable to state the particular acts of that other administration that called for inquiry.&#x2014;As to what had fallen from the noble lord on the subject of India, he saw no reason why the same course that had been in contemplation last session, might not be pursued in this. But thougn no inconvenience would result to the private business, and no breach of law had been committed in the appropriation of the public money, there was one point upon which he felt, that it would be necessary for him and his colleagues to come to the house for indemnity&#x2014;he meant their having taken upon themselves to continue the provisions of the American Treaty, which had expired since the dissolution. This treaty had been renewed from time to time, and he trusted the house would admit the propriety of the conduct of government respecting it, considering the circumstances of our relations with that country.&#x2014;Another topic of charge made by the noble lord was with respect to the Irish customs; but he was happy to state, that this bill could be passed without any violation of the order of this house, or of the house of peers, and without any inconvenience to the public service. He proposed, that the bill should be brought in, and read a first time, after the debate this night; that it should be read a second time to-morrow, and referred to a committee of the whole house on Monday next, in which case, the bill might be finally passed on Tuesday se'nnight, the day next but one after the present bill would expire.&#x2014;(Some marks of dissent from the opposition). This bill had been passed in a similar manner by the gentlemen opposite, last session.&#x2014;The noble lord had objected to the dissolution, whilst the events that caused it were yet fresh, and whilst a cry existed, which had been termed a base cry, a false cry, and a beastly cry, but which had pervaded a great majority of the country; and the noble lord had put it to him as a lawyer, and as a man, whether he thought that the concessions to the Catholics were a violation of the king's coronation oath? But, though neither the indulgences that had been given to the Catholics, nor the concessions then proposed, were, or would be a violation of the coronation oath, he would maintain, that if his majesty, the obligation of whose oath was personal, thought them dangerous to the church, they ought not to be forced upon him, on the authority of any minister.&#x2014;The noble lord had adverted to his conduct on former occasions, as inconsistent with his present conduct. But the no-
<col>634</col>
ble lord alluded particularly to his conduct in 1801, when Mr. Pitt went out of office. He. should have recollected what was the situation of the country at that time; and what was the conduct of the receding minister, who did not retire reluctantly from office, nor oppose his successors with a view to force himself again into office. Had any attempt been made to bring his majesty to the bar of that house?&#x2014;As to the measure of the noble lord, he should solemnly and sincerely declare, that if carried, it would have proved extremely dangerous to the church, because it was only-the beginning of a system which was to be followed up by a repeal of the Test acts on the first convenient opportunity. Would the noble lord state that they would repeal the Test act?&#x2014;[Yes!] Then they could not think it surprising, that those who thought the repeal of those acts dangerous to the Protestant church should oppose their bill. The noble, lord had said, that the measure had been dropped; but was it not to be taken up at a convenient opportunity? He contended that it was the duty of those who thought the repeal of the tests dangerous, to oppose this bill. But then they were told of the inhuman cry that had been set up, and of the blood that might be spilt in consequence if the cry were false why had it produced such an effect, or spread like wildfire over the kingdom? It was not the speech its parliament, nor the address to his constituents at Northampton, of so humble an individual as himself, that could produce such an effect. He gave the gentlemen opposite credit for having brought forward the bill as a measure of conciliation, but he was convinced that the destruction of it had prevented the grievance. Though it might have conciliated one party,it would have encountered the most determined opposition from another. As to his conduct in the year 1804, the measure that had then been adopted was only to allow his Majesty to take into his pay 10,000 foreign troops, some of them Catholics. What had that to do with the establishment? It was only a temporary measure, resorted to during a war. Could any man suppose that his majesty would think of appointing any one of these foreign officers as first lord of the admiralty, or commander in chief? It was not the effect of the late measure alone, but its consequences that he apprehended.&#x2014;Another charge brought against ministers by the noble lord was, that the influence of government had been exercised beyond all former example, at the late election. He was con-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0332"/>
<col>635</col>
vinced, however, that no case could be produced parallel to what had been brought under the consideration of the last parliament, with respect to the Hampshire election. The noble lord had instanced one case respecting Mr. Grogan, but this was the first word he had heard of it. The noble lord had then stated, that it was notorious that 100 inspecting field officers had been appointed to the volunteer force previous to the election, with a view to influence the electors. There might or might not be merit in the appointment of these officers, but his majesty's present ministers, when out of office, had recommended the measure, and now they were in office they had adopted it. But the same officers that had been employed before were appointed, and they had not been appointed until after the election, and this was the measure which the noble lord had represented as an exercise of corrupt influence at elections beyond all former example! The noble lord appeared to him rather rash in his charge, and not to be acquainted with some of the acts of his colleagues: what would the house think of the nomination of 300, not inspecting, but surveying officers of taxes, who could not be appointed either in law, or in fact, till an act of parliament should be passed to authorise the appointment? What would they think of the designation of so many officers, previous to the election of that parliament which was to pass the act, which was to authorise the appointment of these officers? The appointment had not taken place, because the act had not passed, and there remained for the gentlemen opposite only to send lamentable letters of apology, where they had no longer the power to realise their engagements. Whether or not these officers were necessary, he did not take upon him then to express any opinion.&#x2014;The noble lord had expressed his approbation of that expression in the speech, which stated his majesty's determination to cultivate the friendship of foreign powers, and yet asked whether it was meant by that to insinuate that the late government had been guilty of any neglect upon that head? Certainly no insinuation or opinion had been intended one way or the other, and he could truly say, that he agreed in every sentiment expressed by the noble lord upon the subject. The noble lord had said, that it was intended to impute blame to the late ministers, by the expression of his majesty's regret introduced into the speech, for the failure of the negociation with the Porte. But undoubtedly, regret for its failure could not be construed to imply disapprobation of
<col>636</col>
the negociation, the failure of which excited regret. But then the operations in the Sea of Marmora, and in Egypt, had been introduced; and here he could most conscientiously say, that infinite labour had been bestowed on the composition of that passage, so as that it might convey an account of the transactions historically, without imputing blame to any person. If the noble lord were to ask their opinion of these, as military measures, it would not be difficult to give the reply, but unquestionably no such thing was intended by the passage in the speech. The noble lord had alluded to the military measure which had originated with his right hon. friend, and expressed his hopes that they would give it a fair trial. In all his observations on this measure, his comparisons were founded on the combined operation of the regular recruiting, and the measure which was then proposed to be repealed, and which conjointly, he still contended, afforded a more ample supply than the right hon. gent's. system. But as long as the measure of the right hon. gent. should be in force, no opinions of his respecting it should be suffered to impede its progress. As to the allusion of the noble lord to the part which he had taken on the question respecting Neutrals, and the triumph he seemed to feel, because he had not, on coming into office, advised the adoption of different measures, he had only to say, that he was then as fully convinced as before, that the measure of the noble lord was wholly inefficient. Having gone through the whole of the noble lord's statement, he trusted the house would be convinced that he had made no case out for his amendment, and that they would therefore reject it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr Windham</member> <membercontribution>offered himself to the attention of the house, in order to bring back the question to its real grounds. They were all agreed, as it was natural they should be, with respect to the prerogative of his majesty to dissolve his parliament. The hon. gent. who seconded the address, therefore, had given himself unnecessary trouble in discussing a question of which nobody entertained a doubt. His noble friend (lord Howick) in quoting the opinion of lord Somers, that the dissolution of parliament during a session was illegal, had adverted to that authority, to shew, that if such a lawyer entertained such an opinion, the dissolution of parliament during a session ought not to be resorted to without great justification. That, was the argument of his noble friend, and he maintained that it was a sound one. The question then before the house was, whether
<image src="S1V0009P0I0333"/>
<col>637</col>
the dissolution was founded upon wise of good grounds. It was to this that he objected, and was about to state the grounds his objections. The question between annual and septennial parliaments was a question only of degree, so was the question between septennial and perpetual parliaments: but there was no rational proportion in the history of parliaments, between a parliament of four months, and a parliament of four years The right hon. gent. had contended, that the arguments urged in support of the former dissolution, applied with equal force to the late dissolution. But his noble friend had argued, that at the former period, a new crisis had arisen in the war. It was not a new war, but it was a renewed war; and it was therefore desirable, that there should be a parliament, which should continue for some time, because it might be attended with inconvenience, that any change should take place in the public council of the nation, whilst such a contest continued The doctrine of the right hon. gent. went to this, that the parliament should be changed until one should be found, that would accord with what he or any other person might please to state to be the opinion of his majesty; according to this doctrine, there should be a new parliament with every new administration; or, as had been grandly and greatly said by him, who said every thing grandly, and greatly, the late Mr. Burke, we should no longer choose parliaments which might approve of by ministers, but choose parliaments to be approved of by ministers. There might be a crisis which would require the exercise of this prerogative, as that in 1784, when a difference between the two houses threatened an obstruction to the progress of public business. He did not however say, that the measure was justifiable in that instance, though it might be defended on the ground of that disagreement between the two houses. For his part, he thought that the aristocracy had then received a blow from which it had not yet recovered. He should not say what might be the consequences, but certainly there was reason to fear, that the precedent would not be suffered to remain neglected, and the late instance shewed, that the principle was aggravated in each successive application. But he wished to know what was the expediency of the measure in the late instance, when it produced all the inconveniences of a general election, all the injury to private property, and all the detriment to public morals, which such an event was calculated to give rise to.
<col>638</col>
When all these inconveniencies were to be produced, there should be a good justification of the measure. If the Protestant religion was in danger, that would be a justification of the measure; if the ministers thought it was in danger, that would be a justification of them. As to the cry of the Church in danger, he would reply to that by asking of the right hon. gent. himself, did he really, and from his heart, believe any such thing ? When Dr. Johnson was asked by some one, did he believe the authenticity of Ossian's Poems? he replied by asking, Do you believe it? In the same way, he would put it to the right hon. gent., Did he believe that the church was in danger? The belief that every concession would be granted to the Catholics, was the sole ground on which he had voted for the union with Ireland. That measure had added genius and wisdom to the parliament of Britain, but these might well have flourished in their own sphere and added to the patriotisim and pride of their native land. In his opinion, nothing could have justified the Union, but a belief that every privilege could be more securely granted to the Catholics by the united parliament, than by that of Ireland. This was the opinion of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Burke, and Mr. Fox, the most distinguished politicians that had adorned any country. And he would ask the noble secretary, who had been a party to all the measures of Mr. Pitt on this very subject, how could he join in any cry that the church was in danger from measures which fell far short of those which Mr. Pitt had in contemplation? As to the defence which the right hon. gent. had given for his silence in 1801, when the same, and, indeed, more extensive measures were proposed, it was the mere plea of a pleader, and could hardly be listened to with patience, even in any of those courts to which he had been accustomed. He was then in parliament, the friend of Mr. Pitt, and though the late measure did not go one twentieth part as far as that which Mr. Pitt proposed, instead of regarding him as the betrayer of the Protestant faith, he held him up as the only fit man in the country to consolidate and direct its resources. The right hon. gent. however, considered this appeal to the people as having confirmed the truth of his opinions. But he must explain the adage, <i>vox populi, vox dei,</i> in a very large and extensive sense indeed, if he considered this appeal to their dormant prejudices as a decisive testimony to the justice of his opinions. It seem-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0334"/>
<col>639</col>
ed to .be the opinion of the ministers, on the occasion of the late dissolution, that they should take advantage of the cry of "No Popery" while it lasted. They said, we must make hay while the sun shines: the tide of popularity which seemed to run in their favour might otherwise have ebbed, and left them dry on the beach. But what must we think of men who could resort to such means in support of their influence; means which had produced for them that sovereign contempt with, which they have been treated by all sober and thinking men? For two successive parliaments they had abdicated their claims, and in fact declared their incapacity for conducting the affairs of government, and now they stole into power under the despicable cry of "No Popery." What was the common reproach which the enemies of the constitution urged against parliament? Was it not, that it was a body merely subservient to the will of the crown? Yet the ministers, at the close of the last parliament, had held out threats of dissolution, which was to render it more subservient. The house, however, were not to be intimidated by such threats, and were in consequence dissolved. The experiment, however, which they had had recourse to, had not produced the effect they desired. The cry of the Church being in clanger, had failed of its effect, and the candidates for the choice of the people had not been worried and torn to pieces by the fanaticism which it was wished to excite. The cry of "No Popery" had only been heard in remote and comparatively unenlightened places. What had happened in Westminster? There, (though the result of that election was, certainly not, what he Could have wished) it had not so much as been heard of. Though faintly uttered in Middlesex, it had there been equally unsuccessful. In the county of Norfolk, with which he was more immediately connected, though several hot spirits among the clergy had endeavoured to excite and propagate yet they had been repressed by the moderation of that most enlightened and liberal prelate, the Bishop of Norwich. Those who were content to rise to power by such appeals to the worst and most senseless passions of the people, were utterly unfit for its enjoyment and exercise. The house Was loudly called upon to reprobate such conduct by their vote this night. But what must be the effect of the principles which ministers had this night proclaimed with regard to Ireland, a most important
<col>640</col>
part of the empire? No farther concession it seemed was to be granted, and the expectations of a great part of its population were to be closed for ever. Was it nothing to say to them, the door is for ever shut against your claims, there is no farther hope left for you? Instead of being alarmed, however, and exasperated by these declarations, he trusted that they would rather rely upon the good sense of the people of this country, which, during the late election, had declared itself in their favour, and patiently wait for the wiser measures of other men. That stationary situation which the right hon. gent. had recommended, seemed the worst policy. It was perhaps even worse than going, back, and re-enacting those penal statutes, which had long been abrogated. Whatever explanation the right hon. gent. might put upon the doctrine respecting the Coronation Oath, yet this doctrine had been diligently propagated in pamphlets and sermons, and it had been said that it was positively inconsistent with his majesty's Coronation Oath that any further concessions, should be granted to the catholics. The propriety of the late dissolution of parliament was the great question on the present occasion, and on other topics that had been introduced he would not now enter. Ministers seemed to have adopted the doctrine, that it was necessary to form a parliament that was likely to support them, and for, this purpose they had taken a moment when they thought the people would be rendered furious by religious zeal&#x2014;this was their chosen period. But he trusted that the doctrine which he had mentioned would be as much scouted and discountenanced by parliament, as the cry of "No Popery" had been by the bulk of the people.&#x2014;One word, as to the present situation and prospects of the country. The present state of Europe might justly be regarded as a dead calm, such as usually preceded some terrible hurricane. Should Bonaparte be able to subdue the rest of Europe, as was too probable, his whole attention and efforts would then be directed against this country. We were therefore placed in a situation which required all the talents of the country (A laugh). He had not used the expression unthinkingly; he had done it on purpose, and he would again repeat, that the situation of the country demanded the exertion of All its Talents and energies, and perhaps even the combined talents of the country would not be sufficient to rescue it from destruction, if its resources should for any length of time
<image src="S1V0009P0I0335"/>

be placed under the direction of the present ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Craufurd</member> <membercontribution>spoke in justification of the change of ministers. The late ministers had brought his majesty before his late parliament to answer for that change, and a great portion of that parliament, though very far from a majority, having taken part against his majesty, an appeal to the people to decide between his majesty and his late ministers, was rendered absolutely necessary. The people had proved true to the call, and he hoped the house of commons would acquit itself duly and honourably to the crown and to the people. He had supported the late ministers from a high opinion of their talents; he however condemned them for attempting to force themselves on the crown, by compelling the crown to dismiss them. Oh! sublime patriotism, ending in political suicide, and confessed self-murder of their body politic!</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Henry. Mildmay rose</member> <membercontribution>to vindicate his character from the aspersions which the noble lord (Howick) had cast upon it. The noble lord ought in justice to have communicated to him his intention of countenancing the scandalous libels uttered against him and his hon. friend (Mr. S. Bourne) in the newspapers. Without such notice it was not handsome to mention them seriously in the house. He gave notice, as it had been already his intention to do this night, that on Monday he would submit to the house the whole of the circumstances of the transaction alluded to between him and the government. The result of the inquiry would shew, that there was no foundation for the scandalous insinuations uttered against them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Denis Browne</member> <membercontribution>said that he was not a little surprised to hear the noble lord and the right hon. gent. dub themselves champions of the cause of the Roman catholics, for bringing forward a measure, which those who called themselves the representatives of that body, declared they would not thank them for; and which measure, such as it was, they had openly abandoned for the declared, avowed purpose, and for no other, of retaining their places and their power, thereby forsaking all claims to independence as members of parliament. The propriety of the late dissolution of parliament, which had been so much dwelt upon this night, appeared to him to be easily resolved and understood, The late ministers had dissolved the parliament they had found when they
<col>642</col>
came into office, and the people who justly valued their king, and the principles on which he had so long governed this empire; returned the friends of his ministers. A difference soon after arose between the king and his ministers; the consequence of which was their parting; but several members of the commons chose rather to adhere to their patrons the ministers, than to the principles on which their constituents, the people, had elected them. The natural consequence was an appeal to the people. No other question, no other principle was connected with this dissolution than the avowal of the late ministers, either you shall govern with us, or you shall not govern at all. The hon. gent. said he should vote for the original address, and consequently against the amendment. He saw in that amendment the continuance of a plan that first was acted on in 1784, that had often been repeated, often had failed, and that he sincerely hoped ever would fail, forcing the constitutional right of the crown to choose its own advisers, and substituting a faction of that house to rule in its place.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Cochrane </member>, <membercontribution>in a maiden speech, observed, that if any thing could tend to open the eyes of the people as to the mode in which elections were influenced by government, enough had been said to that effect this night, by the two parties into which the house was divided. He alluded to the nomination of the 300 surveyors of taxes, and the appointment of 100 Inspecting Officers. What the real motive of appointing these officers was, whether for influencing the elections or not he would not say. But this much he knew, they were appointed before parliament was dissolved, at least he had been told by one gentleman before that period, that he was to be one of those Field Officers. However, after the mutual charges and recriminations which had been made, he thought there could be little doubt as to the motives and object of these appointments. But he should ever deprecate every interference of ministers in election concerns. He hoped, that as each party charged the other with making jobs with a view to influence the elections, the conduct of both, in this respect, would be inquired into. He hoped some third party would arise, which would keep aloof from selfish interest, and sinecure places and pensions. Unless they acted upon different principles he could not honestly support either of the present parties. Both the address and the amendment seemed to him objectionable in some points. He disapproved of pre-

judging the expedition to Egypt, or of passing an oblique censure on it, while he could not approve of the amendment, since he could not find fault with the exercise of the royal prerogative in dismissing his late ministers and dissolving the parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan rose </member>, <membercontribution>and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;I shall, Mr. Speaker, consider the present question in two points of view, both as it regards the Catholics of Ireland, and as it affects his Majesty's late ministers. In Speaking of their conduct, I cannot suppress the feelings I entertained for them while in office; neither can I be silent on the circumstances which led to, and attended their dismissal. I approve of that ministry, because they preferred their principles to their places. I approve of them because they constitutionally refused to be restricted by an unconstitutional pledge. I approve of them because they were sincere in their wishes to create national strength, by national unanimity. I approve of them because they endeavoured to unite the people, and dissolve a party; and I most approve of them because they wisely ceased to prosecute the justified claims of the Irish Catholics, when they were convinced the prosecution was highly inexpedient. I say, his majesty's late ministers acted wisely in introducing a measure, which in its origin, appeared highly practicable, and in withdrawing it, when they were satisfied it was for the time impracticable. They proposed it with a view to conquer, and they abstained from precipitately pressing it, when they were unfortunately disappointed in that expectation. To this dilemma they were reduced, that if the bill was expedient, why not introduce it? and being expedient, why abandon it? [a laugh from the ministerial benches.] The hon. gentlemen on the opposite side may laugh, but I contend, that the true view of legislation and policy, is not to push even a good principle too far; when there is no opportunity of effecting the object, and where the evils arising from the failure, must materially detract from the benefits of even ultimate success. But, when I lay down this position, I feel it my duty strenuously to oppose that principle, which, at a moment when we are surrounded with enemies, and assailed with dangers, at a moment when our best and surest safeguard exists in the unanimity of the people, would defeat the benefits of that unanimity&#x2014;would, at the same moment that it divided the publ<ob/> feeling, and distracted the popular energy, hold out to the foe, who menaces
<col>644</col>
us, the alarming and detestable hope, that a great majority of those who were most prominent in rank, in talents, in property, had conspired with a great proportion of your physical force, against the acknowledged establishment of Church and State. To admit such a position, is to perpetuate an incurable evil. It is to infuse into two classes of your fellow subjects, the principles and resources of an inextinguishable hostility. To support this evil, great reasons should be adduced by the advocates of disunion, or at least better reasons than we have either heard or found in the speeches and productions of those who have thought it their interest to promote it. For, however you apply your ingenuity, however anxious to realize the mischief which gentlemen have contrived to apprehend, reduce it to plain sense, analyze whatever either of dignified, profound, or learned, that has been advanced by your ecclesiacties or your corporations, whatever of wisdom or of research has been in their addresses or their communications, to this plain conclusion it must be reduced&#x2014;that in the Catholic bill proposed by my noble friend (lord Howick) there was a danger from admitting, Catholic fellow subjects into our armies, and into a participation of the privileges of our constitution. What was the fact? The danger, either way, has, and does exist. The Catholics constitute a great portion of your military force. They constitute almost the whole of the Irish Militia. They bear a considerable proportion to the establishment of the Irish Yeomanry. They have been admitted by the act of 1793, to a participation of the civil rights of the constitution and, therefore, if the clamour which has been raised, if the outcry which has been circulated of the danger arising from the catholic bill be in any part, or to any extent, justified, that has been substantial danger to your establishment, to your army, to your religion, for, the last 14 years. Nay, your country has, for that period, been in a great degree defended by those whom the alleged supporters of Church and State have presumed to represent as their country's enemies. If has been their constant and unceasing cry, that ruin, inevitable ruin, would be the consequence of repealing the disqualifying statutes against the Irish catholics. Let us examine the validity of this apprehension, and ascertain the length to which it ,runs. If ruin be the consequence of Catholic indulgence, then I answer, you must retrace your steps, you must undo what the king
<image src="S1V0009P0I0337"/>
<col>645</col>
and. the parliament have already enacted for Catholic liberation, you must again recur to your penalties, and annul your grants. For by such a reasoning, to this inference we must come, that if the hon. gentlemen, the friends of Church and State, refuse to repeal those grants, they must give up their argument, and if they repeal them, they must abandon their army. For, however it has been the interest of those who opposed the Catholic bill, as introduced by my noble friend, to misrepresent it, yet in their face, and in the face of this house, I assert, that the measure introduced in the last parliament did not go one step farther, either in its provisions, or its extension, than the Irish bill of 1793. The case is plainly this, that in opposing the late bill, you admit this strange principle, that disloyalty does not exist amidst the lower classes of the Catholic Multitude, but that it does pervade the higher and more respectable description of that persuasion. They are already tolerated, it will be said; they are permitted to enjoy the full exercise of their religious feelings. This, I say, is not sufficient, nor is it the proper or enlarged view of that great and important subject. The Catholics of Ireland are identified with the constitution of the empire. They are our equals, our brethren, fully entitled to the participation of civil rights, and the enjoyment of constitutional blessings. When, therefore, we are told, that they exist by sufferance, we are giving ear to an opinion which attacks a fundamental branch of the state and of the national security. The measure of the Union between the two countries made no change between the relative rights of the people. It made no alteration nor admitted of any infringement in the existing claims of the Irish subjects. You took the Irish Catholic with his privileges, and can now find no pretext for destroying them. The dangers which have been attributed to this measure; are chimerical; if they are real, they go to destroy the treat organization of your military system. Indeed the argument is,so false, that no drunken boaster, or corporation orator, with all their prejudices or their passions, could seriously give utterance to these alarms, which have been both mentioned and propagated by some apparently great politicians. For reasons, even they are inclined to admit that the bill was innoxious but that the minister who propounded it was dangerous. The, noble lord (Castlereagh) and the right hon. secretary (Mr. Canning) could not consistently with
<col>646</col>
their former conduct and recorded pledges; war with the principle, they therefore have directed their present hostility against the minister; who had the sincerity to act upon that principle. The right hon gent. the chancellor of the exchequer, cannot adopt the principle of his colleagues, because it appears big with danger, and reple<ob/>e with ruin. I condole with him for his fears, but can give no credit to the validity of his statement. I cannot for a moment admit the validity of a statement, the most hostile to the particular interests of Ireland, and the general security of the empire. I cannot, I say, as the friend of my own country, as solicitous for its fame and fortune, give credit to a proposition, monstrous in its conception, and destructive in its effects. As a member of Europe I protest against this unjustified, dangerous argument, which tends unavoidably to deprive it of the means of rescue and recovery from the alarming and impending calamities with which it is threatened. I feel proud that with all the temptation, with the endeavours which have been so unwisely and so improperly made, the expedient has not only proved unsuccessful, but hopeless. There is not, I say, any disposition on the part of this country to quarrel with their Irish brethren on account of religion. The good sense and liberality of the people have prevailed against the misapplied zeal of the bigot, and the interested speculation of the miserable politician. It is the victory of the unadulterated good sense of the English people, over religious discord and unchristian rancour. All Church cries, have, in every stage of society, been mischievous; calamity has ensued, although the objects of their propagation was not accomplished. Though they "like the, tall bully lift their heads and lie," yet the annals of our history prove that they have injured. In the reign of Charles I. and II. they created a party which overturned the establishments of the country, and shed the best blood of its people. In the reign of queen Anne, they paralysed, the energies of the nation, and rendered unavailing the great victories of the duke of Marlborough. The religious animosities of England aggrandised the power,of France, and led to that disposition of Europe, which now alarms us with its tremendous effects. In 1780, the cry of "No Popery" was nearly successful, in defending the church, by burning the city. Religious alarms are not the efforts of great or comprehensive minds; they originate in low malicious cunning, and operate on ig-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0338"/>
<col>647</col>
norant irritability. It is not on religion they are founded, because they are generally the expedients of the depraved. They are hatched with the hope of delusion, and are the worst political vices baptized. There is nothing,profound, nothing wise, nothing dignified in their influence; nothing to excite public spirit, or to stimulate to great exertion. They call forth no proud or honourable energies, and have not embattled on. their side, even the manly vices of the country. I rejoice to find that the people of this kingdom have not fallen into the snare, which was laid with so much art and duplicity to entrap them. In my country the wicked attempt has not only failed, but the opposite principle has triumphed. The people of Ireland have not only, scouted the abominable yell, but have avoided a policy which might, have been dangerous to the general interest. They have not answered folly by folly; when you wrote upon your walls, "No Popery;" they did not retort the cry of "No England." They left an idle bugbear to perish by its own imbecility an unfounded calumny to be defeated by its appropriate incredibility. They disdained to make a serious comment upon senseless cant. I do not pretend to say that there were some amongst them who entertained strong feelings, upon the rejection, or rather the withdrawing of the Catholic Bill, but I contend that the great body of Irish people were so far satisfied, as not to be dissatisfied, and that their conduct evinced a great and striking tenacity, of good order, and the love of national peace. The College of Dublin would not address the throne, on the ministerial change which had taken place; the set of learning would not disgrace itself by lending support to this vulgar and abominable cry of the Church in Danger. They who were well acquainted with the precepts and interests of religion, knew best to defend that religion by a religions dignity and a Christian moderation. They wisely separated an inviolable reverence for their king from an attachment to a despicable court intrigue. The city of Dublin also disbelieved this church alarm, and even the most illiberal, I myself found free from the animosity of religious madness. It was true that the corporation voted an address to the throne; but though bound to my country by the ties of honours conferred for services performed, and though I can differ from any part of my constituents but with regret, yet I will boldly say, that my own opinions on this subject, are the opinions of
<col>648</col>
my country. I treat with respect the feelings of those who differ from me. I condemn the principle, but do not deprecate the authority. To the people of England I say, that the Irish Catholic never has entertained the opinion that they were hostile to his emancipation. He could not suppose that though you first removed the parliament under the pretext of releasing him from religious disqualifications, you would afterwards declare not only war against that religion, but hostility against his constitutional freedom. Beware of that hostility; it will be only a division of public interest, and a diminution of national strength. Extend that feeling of sympathy which rejoice to see so strongly exemplified amongst your people. By so doing, you will compensate for the defection of allies, and the failure of expeditions; you will fortify that great western-barrier, which is best calculated to counterpoise the destruction of the balance of power, and behind which are secured not only your own immediate advantage and security, but the reversionary interests of Europe. Let your ecclesiastics, corporations, statesmen, and great dignitaries, consecrate it. For, unfortunately, should you recur to an unjust and illiberal policy, instead of a manly and enlarged system, you will not only fill up the measure of your own overthrow, accelerate the means of your own subjugation, but actually destroy the hopes of the civilized world, and lose the globe itself. Under these impressions I give my ardent and sincere support to the amendment of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>declared that he should consider himself guilty of a dereliction of his duty to the great and independent body of freeholders who delegated to him the important trust of representing them, if he suffered a question which, brought the conduct of his majesty's ministers into consideration to pass without his decided and most unequivocal animadversion. The right hon. chancellor of the exchequer, had cavilled and endeavoured to prove, that the period when himself and his colleagues had dared, to advice his majesty to dissolve the last parliament, was the least likely to interrupt the public business. But the, charge against them was not only the interruption which the public business received by that measure; it went further; it arraigned them of postponing that measure, until they had ascertained their strength and then recurring to a dissolution, because they were unable to meet the support of an independent
<image src="S1V0009P0I0339"/>
<col>649</col>
parliament. When unable to new model that parliament they resorted to this profligate and corrupt exercise of the prerogative. The noble lord observed, that the king's speech contained an intimation of an intention to revive the Committee of Finance; but this passage in the speech he considered as a kind of lure for public credulity, and inserted solely to catch the vulgar eye; for what reformation or improvement of any kind could be expected from ministers whose first act on coming into power was the introduction into his majesty's councils of a person stigmatized and pronounced guilty of mal<ob/>practices by the house of commons? What could be expected, he begged to ask, from ministers who had thus set the authority and decision of parliament at defiance, in order to accomplish their own ends; quite regardless as the fact had proved, of the substantial interest of the country? It was truly laughable, if, he could for a moment treat so important a question-with levity, to hear them say that they had appealed to the sense of the country: what make an appeal to the sense of the country, surely ministers must have meant that they appealed to the nonsense of the country, for it was from that chiefly they received support and co-operation. In a few places, they had indeed gained some advantage immediately after the dissolution, from the abom<ob/>nable cry of "No Popery," but at a time a little more remote from the dissolution of parliament, they failed in most places to accomplish their object, because men began to reflect seriously, and to examine coolly into the nature of the appeal made to the country. It was impossible in a country so distinguished for sound judgment and strong understanding, as this was, that deception could be long practised with success, and accordingly, the first moments of deliberation and enquiry, dissipated the mist of hypocrisy, and exposed to public view the design of ministers.&#x2014;He begged pardon for trespassing so long on the time of the house, but he could not forego this opportunity of shewing to his constituents and to the nation, the opinion which he entertained of men, whose first act, as he had already stated, was to recall to his majesty's councils profligacy and corruption.</membercontribution></p>

If the tribunal was competent, if the prosecution was not remiss, if the verdict was not incomplete, if there was any thing in English justice, it was that an individual so acquitted could not again be arraigned. He looked upon the, resolution against lord Melville as virtually annulled by his lordship's acquittal, or he should long since have moved for its erasure from the journals [a cry of move now, move, from both sides of the house.] He should move, but that he thought the resolution already annulled. If the noble lord thought otherwise, let him name a day, and he would be ready to go into the question with him upon a resolution of censure upon his majesty's ministers for the recall.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>would confine himself entirely to the consideration of what the present ministers had done; the question of their appointment having been already decided. He would judge his majesty's ministers by their acts, and the only act of theirs that could come now under consideration was the dissolution of parliament. This act he thought justifiable under the peculiar circumstances of the case, and it was enough for him that it was justifiable, to induce him to vote in favour of the address and against the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Pollington</member> <membercontribution>was sorry to hear the name of the sovereign brought forward in the discussions of that house, a thing which should never be done without absolute necessity. He thought the late dissolution a very great interruption to private as well as public business in that house; and he took occasion to observe, without saying who was the cause of it, that the cry of "No Popery," was an infamous one.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Hope</member> <membercontribution>adverted to what had been said on the subject of lord Melville's trial. That noble lord had been punished, and twice unjustly. He was punished before trial, which nobody could dispute was unjust. He was punished after he was acquitted, which was equally unjust; this he meant to refer to what had been said of that noble lord, under the authority of the late administration. He thought that the most prominent, as well as the most beautiful part of our constitution, was the administration of justice under it; but even that had not restrained the party rage of the late administration. The impeachment of that noble lord had been carried on by party, aided by no inconsiderable share of personal vanity;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0340"/>
<col>651</col>
and under that impression certain gentlemen acted, or they never would have become prosecutors.&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>reminded the hon. general that he had transgressed the boundaries of order, in imputing unworthy motives to any hon. member of that house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Croker</member> <membercontribution>was happy to find the address now before the house unobjectionable, for it had been objected to, and the amendment was brought forward on the part of the late administration, to censure the conduct of the present; when they, the late administration, dared not bring forward any one measure of their own while in power; for this opinion he appealed to the house, whether that was not the view of the motion for this amendment, whether it did not relate purely to what passed formerly, and which, whether right or wrong, could not now be altered, and therefore there could be no good in discussing it? And yet, such was the course which was recommended to us by opposition, at a time when the map of Europe was only another word almost for the map of France; thus it was proposed that the time of the house should be taken up in hearing contests for places and power. Much had been said about the secret advisers of the crown; he wished to know whether it was to be contended that it was unconstitutional for the king ever to have any adviser who was unknown to the house of commons; or would they call his majesty to the bar of that house on any subject in which his adviser was unknown? If that was constitutional doctrine, it was unknown to him. Conduct had been observed that was infamous, as a noble lord had elegantly expressed it. Now, as to Ireland, he would venture to say, that as to political Matters, that description was much more applicable to the late than to the present administration. And as to what had been said of the family at Wexford, whose name, from the pronunciation of the noble lord, he did not understand, he would invite the noble lord to look at the last election but one for Wexford, and there he would find the conduct of the late administration in its true light. I will ask, said the hon. gent., the noble lord not to interfere in any of our concerns in Ireland; we are friends of peace, and I therefore advocate the non-advocating of the noble lord. As to what had been said by the right hon. gent. (Mr. Grattan) he had told the house that ministers, on the subject of the catholics, must either abandon their arguments or abandon the army. There was no occasion to
<col>652</col>
do either. Last year we had heard the same sentences on the same subject; we were told that we should by refusing what was asked, paralyze the army, and dismantle the navy; but there was no truth in it. We were told also that we should not inherit our country, and that the inhabitants should be deprived of their mother. It was in vain to talk of fleets or armies, the only thing to give tranquility to Ireland was unanimity in that house. Emancipation might do something, but without unanimity nothing would be effectual there. He was a friend to the most general toleration that could be desired by any statesman: he did sincerely hope to see the day when the happy work would be completed of the emancipation of the catholics; but more had been done already for them in his majesty's gracious reign than at any former period; more had been done for the dissipation of bigotry than in any former reign. He wished for the inhabitants of Ireland the full benefit of the constitution like other men, but that was a thing not to be accomplished in half a session of parliament. He did not blame the late administration for their motives in the late measures they offered on behalf of the catholics, but it had a singularly unfortunate effect, for it disgusted those whom it professed to relieve, and enraged those whom it disappointed. There had been much art made use of to mislead the Irish people. There was a person of the name of Keogh, who had delivered a speech to the Catholics in Ireland, and that speech had been afterwards made up into a pamphlet, which was of the most reasonable and rebellious tendency that ever disgraced the country in which it appeared, and so the house would say if they read it; but the house of commons attentively perused large folios on the affairs of India, while it would not look at a small pamphlet on those of Ireland. It was owing to inflammatory harangues, however, that men committed such excesses; and those who committed them were not genuine Irish catholics, but they were French Demagogues, Jacobins, and French emissaries. They had at one time, however, been so furious, that the right hon. gent. himself (Mr. Grattan), could not go to the Irish house of commons without his sabre, for which reasons, Ireland should give a specimen of at least ten years without rebellion, before she could reasonably look for emancipation: ten years was but a short period of probation on such an occasion, it was only three years beyond the pe-

<col>653</col>
riod of a common apprenticeship. But it had been said that his majesty had been unfavourably advised towards his Catholic subjects. Had gentlemen forgotten the series of indulgences his majesty had been graciously pleased to shew them? Had they forgotten what his majesty did in the year 1780, when he became the bold defender of his Popish subjects against a protestant mob. By this and by other acts, all ranks of his majesty's subjects, of whatever persuasion, were sure of benefiting by his paternal solicitude for his people. These were his sentiments; and he uttered them, not, with a view to please ministers, for he knew none of them personally; he did not think that he ever was in the same room with any of them; certainly he had, nothing to ask of them; but he delivered these sentiments on the pure principles of independence. He should oppose the amendment, and most heartily support the address.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Stuart Wortley</member> <membercontribution>took notice of what the noble lord (Milton) had advanced concerning his constituents. That noble lord had impressed the house with an idea that the majority of the landed proprietors, and of the commercial interest in the county of York, as stated by the noble lord, was in favour of the late administration: though the noble lord had obtained a majority, it arose from the misconception of the clothiers, with respect to the conduct of one of the candidates, Mr. Lascelles. But surely this was no proof whatever that the late ministers were more popular than their successors.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. William Smith</member> <membercontribution>agreed with the right hon. gent. (Mr Bathurst) that the question lay within a very narrow compass, but differed from him in his view of it. He did not think that the question lay, in the first instance, between the king and his ministers, though the present ministers had made it a colour to answer their own views throughout, the country. In saying this, he had no occasion, on his own part, to quarrel with them for the dissolution, because it afforded him an opportunity of proving again the high opinion which his constituents entertained of his consistency and opposition to the system supported by the present minister. He asked the present administration what they had made of their cry of "No Popery" at Bristol, Liverpool, Westminster, and, Middlesex? He was decidedly in favour of the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathrust</member> <membercontribution>explained, and said that he
<col>654</col>
did not believe his ill-treatment at Bristol was owing to any such cry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ryder</member> <membercontribution>said, that when his right hon. friend, the present chancellor of the exchequer, consented to continue as attorney-general when Mr. Pitt came last into administration, he did so under an express stipulation that the catholic measure should be brought forward, he should oppose it. Gentlemen on the other side of the house complained of the manner in which the Catholic bill had been opposed; it was their own fault for bringing it forward; they produced every thing they now complained of. As. to the late administration, as a body, he had to observe, that some of them were great men, but, they were made up of discordant materials: like those of 1784, they promised a good deal, depended upon themselves much, but produced but little, and they met much the same fate, their dismissal being followed by a dissolution of parliament; with regard to the leading member of the late administration, the late Mr. Fox; of his talents there was but one opinion; of their application, a great variety. In opposition, he had done much mischief. In government he might have done much good; but really, with the exception of the Slave Trade bill, and the New Plan of Finance, which was a, good measure, although the defects of it were numerous, he knew of no public measure that reflected honour on the late administration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Temple</member> <membercontribution>said, the question before the House had been amply discussed; and he would only make a few observations in vindication of the late Administration. The cry against the Catholic bill had been raised by the present ministers for the purpose of injuring those who projected it. How far that cry had succeeded would be proved. He should, however, think the house disgraced itself if it did not approve of the late ministers, as no fair pretence had been stated for the imputations cast on them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty rose </member>, <membercontribution>and said, before he offered to explain some particulars relative to the late administration, he felt anxious to hear what reason could be assigned for the late act of dissolving the parliament without any apparent cause; but no satisfactory observations had transpired on that subject. The Catholic bill had been discussed last session of parliament, and if any animosity had been excited in the country it was by the character given of that bill, not by the bill itself. It would occur that no cry had been raised against the bill when it
<image src="S1V0009P0I0342"/>
<col>655</col>
was first proposed in parliament; but the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer and his colleagues had opposed it, as the means of getting into office. An allusion was made by a noble lord relative to the opinion of lord Somers. He had read the passage from lord Somers, who stated that the parliament ought not to be prorogued, until the petitions before the house were satisfactorily answered. He was inclined to give credit to the statement, for he found it corroborated by historical fact. With respect to the observations which fell from the Chancellor of the exchequer, relative to the appointment of 300 Surveyors of Taxes, he would state the fact: in the summer before the last, not owing to any communication with the treasury, the Board of Excise proposed to the treasury a scheme for improving the revenue, by the appointment of the officers alluded to. The plan was adopted, and recommendations were given representing persons fit to become surveyors. Their appointments were not made out, but letters were written, stating that attention, should be paid to the recommendations. He considered this circumstance advantageous to the revenue, and was anxious to submit to any investigation the right hon. gent. might think fit to bring forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Canning</member> <membercontribution>replied to the principal arguments which had been argued in support of the amendment. He alluded to the different accounts which had been given of the late change of administration. At one time, the honourable gentlemen stated, that they bad voluntarily retired from office, and at another, that they had waited until they were forced to abandon their places. They might choose which of these cases they liked best, but he could not allow them to take to themselves both all the grace of resignation, and all the grievance of dismissal. The latter, however, was the event. They had stuck with great obstinacy to their situations, and a main objection which seemed to be urged against some of his friends was, that they wanted that first quality of great statesmen&#x2014;tenacity of place. In reply to the objection of a noble lord (Cochrane) in alluding to Constantinople and Egypt, that the address seemed to imply a censure on his majesty's late ministers, with respect to the distribution of the military and naval force of the country, he observed, that such certainly was not the object of the address. It had merely been intended to state facts with regard to the situation of this country and of Europe. He begged, however, in saying
<col>656</col>
this, that it might not be supposed his majesty's government had no opinion on the subjects alluded to by the noble lord. That opinion might in due time be expressed; but he would not have it understood that his majesty's ministers were pledged to any particular proceedings. He alluded to the libels which had appeared against himself and his friends near him. With regard to one which had been published, in order to insinuate, that he had in a certain case been influenced by a corrupt motive; if the noble lord (Howick) had searched the records of his office, he would have found that that proceeding had originated in an act signed by the hand of Mr. Fox.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. T. Grenville</member> <membercontribution>replied to the observations of the last speaker, and particularly complained of the insinuations thrown out against tine late administration, with respect to the expeditions to Turkey and Egypt. He remarked, that the opinion which had fallen from the right hon. secretary, respecting the subject of Turkey and Egypt, was very different from that stated by the chancellor of the exchequer. The latter right hon. gent. had disavowed any intention to impute blame on the late administration with regard to those points. The language of the right hon. secretary was however very different. He broadly insinuated censure. This conduct be could not but regard as highly unjustifiable. If no blame was meant, why make the insinuation? He trusted that either no insinuation would be made, or that a direct charge would be brought forward. If a distinct charge of censure was advanced, his friends knew how to meet and refute it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>observed, that a noble, friend of his (lord Milton) had been spoken of in terms of great asperity, because he alluded to his constituents, and spoke of them, it was said, as if nobody else in the house had constituents. He would ask the right hon. secretary, if he had constituents in the sense in which the word was understood by the noble lord? When the right hon. secretary had, in pursuance of his audacious and unconstitutional threat, sent the members of the last parliament back to their constituents, did he himself venture to appeal to any popular body? The noble secretary of state near him had once represented a populous county in Ireland, and had afterwards been rejected. But it did not appear, with all the anxiety of the present administration to appeal to the sense of the people, that the noble viscount it had thought it advisable to submit his conduct to the judg-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0343"/>
<col>657</col>
ment of his old constituents in the county of Down. He alluded to what had fallen from noble lord lately returned for the populous city of Westminster. It appeared, that neither the amendment nor the address were capable of satisfying that noble lord. He did not like the former, because he thought that to adopt it, would imply that the house approved of the conduct of the late administration. He condemned the address, on the other hand, because it seemed to contain a censure on the employment of the force of the country. In. this dilemma, he was at a loss to conjecture how the noble lord would act; perhaps he would think it his duty not to vote at all. He alluded to the late contest for Wexford, and stated, from a paper which he held in his hand, that, Mr. Ormsby, the solicitor for the forfeited estates in Ireland, went down to the election, and personally waited on Mr. Grogan for the purpose of influencing him to support the ministerial candidates, by a promise of the re-assignment of the estates of the late Cornelius Grogan, his brother, which were forfeited.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Arthur Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>declared, that the government of Ireland had not interfered, nor given any instructions to Mr. Ormsby upon this subject: had any improper use been made of that influence, it was unknown to government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>said, the letter of Mr. Ormsby was perfectly compatible with the fact, and he called upon the right hon. bart. to deny it if he could. He challenged the right. hon. secretary himself to shew the contrary, and said, that the first object the government was to dispossess him of the confidence of his constituents, but they failed, in this as almost every other effort of a similar nature, and the proof of the fact was, that he had fourscore more votes on his last election, than he has when he was chancellor of the exchequer for that part of the United Kingdom. The abuse of the constitutional power in that country was most scandalous and disgraceful, and the primary object of the government was to carry their point by the worst kind of influence.<lb/>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-06-27">Saturday, June 27.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES] Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>gave notice, that he should on Monday move, that the papers relative to the Affairs of India, commonly called the Oude Papers, be re-printed.&#x2014;Mr. Lethbridge presented a Petition from Mr. Palmer of the Post Office, praying for public money, as a remuneration for his services. The petition, and also the proceedings of the committee to whom the matter had been referred in the year 1797, were ordered to be printed; and the hon. member gave notice, that he should on Tuesday move for the house to go into a Committee, to take the same into consideration.&#x2014;Sir S. Romilly presented a petition from 130 persons confined for debt in the King's Bench Prison, 54 of whom were charged in execution, and the remaining 76 on mesne process. They were ready, he said, to give up all their property to their creditors, who refused to consent to their being set at liberty on such terms: 112 of the number had families dependant upon them for support, and the number of their children amounted to 347. The petition prayed for revision of the laws of debtor and creditor. It was his wish not to have presented this petition, because it had been said in another place, that he had it in contemplation to bring in a bill to alter and amend these laws, when, in fact, he had no Such intention. The reason why he did not bring forward such a measure was, that he had not been able to discover any effectual remedy for the very great evil complained of. However, as the petitioners were desirous that he should present their petition to the house, he thought it his duty to comply with their request, though he should nut follow it up with any motion, 
<col>660</col>
except that it should lie on the table. He had presented the petition on the earliest opportunity, in order that, if the business should be taken up by parliament, gentlemen might have the most ample time possible afforded for directing their attention to the subject. The petition was then brought up, and ordered to lie on the table.&#x2014;Lord Howick thought it necessary, in order to judge of the nature of the resolution to be proposed by the chancellor of the exchequer on Monday next, relative to Private Bills, that the house should be in possession of information respecting the actual state of the private business at the late dissolution. As he did not suppose there could be any objection to the production of the information he required upon this head, he should move, "That there be laid before the house, an account of all the Private Bills, which were in their progress through that house on the 27th of April last, specifying the stages to which they had severally arrived; and of all the Private Bills, that had passed, but had not received the royal assent." Ordered.&#x2014;Lord Howick adverting to the statement made on the preceding evening by the chancellor of the exchequer, relative to the conduct of government in having acted upon the provisions of the American Treaty bill, after that bill had expired, thought that the house should be made acquainted with the extent to which such provisions had been acted upon without the authority of law. This information would be necessary previous to the discussion of the bill of indemnity, which the right hon. gent. proposed to bring forward. He did not imagine there could be any objection to the production of Copies of all Orders from the different Public Offices, since the 27th of April, for the Collection of Duties not authorized by law. The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not apprehend that there was any other order, but the Order of Council, dated the 27th of May, for continuing the regulations of the act that had expired, till other provisions should be prepared by parliament, that could be produced on this subject, and that order he held in his hand, and had brought down to present to the house this day. The chancellor of the exchequer then presented the Order of Council which was ordered to lie on the table, and to be printed.&#x2014;Lord Howick moved, that there be laid before this house, an account showing the amount of all sums of money that have been issued at the receipt of the Exchequer to the paymaster general of the forces, the treasurer of the navy, the treasurer

Ordered.&#x2014;Mr. Bankes gave notice, that on Monday next, he should move for leave to bring in a bill to prevent the granting of Places or Offices in reversion. It had also been his intention to give notice of a motion for the revival of the Finance committee, but that was in other hands, in which he was happy to see it, and he trusted that no time would be lost in bringing it forward.&#x2014;Mr. Whitbread gave notice, that on Monday se'ennight, he should submit a motion to the house, relative to the State of the Nation. The hon. gent. also gave notice, that on Friday, he should move for the revival of one or two of the bills for the education and relief of the Poor.&#x2014;Mr. Croker wished to know from the noble lord opposite, who had in the debate of the preceding night, adverted to the subject of Tithes in Ireland, whether it was his intention to bring forward any measure on that subject this session? The hon. member was proceeding to comment on the importance of the question to Ireland, when he was reminded by the Speaker, of his being not in order.&#x2014;Lord Howick replied, that there had been plans for the amelioration of the Tithes system in Ireland, under the consideration of his Majesty's late ministers, and that it was their intention as soon as they could bring any one to maturity, to submit it to parliament. He had alluded to the subject on the preceding evening only to recommend it to the most serious attention of his majesty's ministers. He did not mean to take up the question this session, but might in a future session, though for every reason he thought it better that such a measure should originate with government.&#x2014;Mr. Hall brought up the report of the address, which was agreed to, and the address ordered to be presented by such Members as are of his majesty's privy council&#x2014;The lords commissioners' speech on opening the session was then ordered to be referred to a committee of the whole house on Monday.&#x2014;lord Castlereagh brought down the following Message from the king: viz.&#x2014;George R. His Majesty being desirous of conferring a signal mark of his favour and approbation on major general sir John Stuart, knight of the most honourable order of the bath, in consequence of the eminent services rendered by him in the brilliant and decisive

victory obtained by the troops under his command against a superior French force upon the plains of Maida, on the 4th day of July 1806, and of the valour and skill displayed by him on that occasion, recommends it to his faithful Commons to enable his majesty to make provision for securing to the said sir John Stuart a pension of 1000l. per annum for the term of his natural life. G. R." Ordered to be taken into consideration on Monday.&#x2014;The usual resolutions respecting the Trial of Election petitions were then voted, and petitions were presented, complaining of the returns for Saltash, Horsham, and Great Grimsby. The first was ordered to be taken into consideration on the 14th of July, and the two others on the 16th. In answer to a question from lord Temple respecting the course proposed to be adopted concerning the Election petitions, the chancellor of the exchequer replied, that it would not be desirable to proceed with any petitions this session, which would be likely to extend to any length in the examination of their merits.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[INDIA BUDGET.]&#x2014;Mr. Hiley Addington</member> <membercontribution>seeing his hon. friend (Mr. R. Dundas) in his place, wished to know whether it was his intention to bring forward the accounts of the East India Company this session. If so, he trusted that he would bring them forward on as early a day as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>replied that it was certainly his intention to bring forward the accounts of the East India Company this session, and that no time should be unnecessarily lost. At the same time he begged to remind the right hon. gent. that for some years back, these accounts had been one year in arrears. It was his intention to endeavour to bring up that arrear in the present session, and the right hon. gent. must be aware that this would require some time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>observed, that from the papers then upon the table it appeared, that, upon a comparison of the Revenue and Expenditure of the Company in India, there was a deficit in the latter of above two millions and a half. This was a state of things, in which any one might see that it was impossible for the company to go on, without some adequate provision to make good this deficit. It was the more necessary, as the public had been led to expect than there would be a considerable participation, derived from the East India Company's funds, in aid of the national resources. He wished to know whether the hon. gent. meant to 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0346"/>
<col>663</col>
bring forward any proposition upon that subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>informed the noble lord, that it was his intention, at an early day, to propose some regulations respecting the affairs of India, which would include the point to which the noble lord had adverted. He was afraid, however, that he should not be able to bring forward the annual accounts at so early a day, as only a few of the ships had yet arrived, and it would be desirable to have the accounts stated in the most correct manner that was possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH REVENUE BILLS.]</member> <membercontribution>The order of the day being read for the house going into a committee on the Irish Revenue bills, and the question being put, that the Speaker do leave the chair,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>rose, not to oppose the motion, but simply to observe that, by the dissolution of parliament, they had been placed in this situation, that about two millions of money, raised under the Irish Revenue acts, must either not be levied at all, or must be collected on British subjects without any legal authority. Without sending the act of parliament by a balloon, or a carrying pigeon, it was out of the nature of things, even supposing it to pass both houses with the most unexampled rapidity, that it could arrive in Ireland till several days after the existing act had expired.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>argued that the hereditary duties to which all goods were already subject, would, even in the event of the payment of the additional revenues being resisted, which was not probable, enable the revenue officers, on the arrival of the act, still to levy the additional duties with precision.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Foster</member> <membercontribution>observed, that a similar dilemma had already twice occurred, and no bad consequences had resulted.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>was glad the right hon. gent. had stated this fact. He would tell the house how the dilemma had been got the better of; it was only done by adding one illegal act to another; by informing those who refused to pay the additional duties on the goods which they had removed in the mean time, that until they paid such additional duties, they should not be allowed to land any more goods. The father-in-law of the present member for Dublin (Mr. Shaw) rather than do so had retired from business sooner than he intended; declaring that he would never submit to the allowing the Custom House officers to take from him what they were not entitled to by law. In this way the merchants in Ireland had been sur-

charged every year, except the year when he had the management of the Revenue of Ireland.&#x2014;After some additional conversation the house went into a committee. Ordered that the report be brought up on Monday.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-06-29">Monday, June 29.</date>
<p><member>[AMERICAN TRADE BILL.]&#x2014;Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>presented, by his majesty's command, the Order in Council, continuing the provisions of the American Intercourse act, which expired during the recess, and gave notice that it was the intention of his majesty's government to propose to parliament a bill for continuing the above act for a time to be then specified, and to propose in such bill a clause of Indemnity for the advice given to his majesty to continue the provisions of the former act, after it had legally expired.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Auckland</member> <membercontribution>stated that the reason he did not, when in office, recommend the continuance of the act which had now expired was the pending negociation with America. He trusted, that when the treaty which was the result of that negociation came to be discussed, it would be discussed as a treaty ratified, and he felt satisfied it would be found that every possible attention had been paid to the interests of this country. He thought it but fair now to state, that when the question of the renewal of the American Intercouse act came to be discussed, he should probably be of opinion, that the same reasons which before operated did not exist for the continuance of the act. One part of it, in particular, he objected to, and was objected to during the negociation; he alluded to that part of it which allowed to the Americans a carrying-trade between our possessions in the East Indies and Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>referred to the Bill of Rights to prove the illegality of levying money by the authority of the crown, without the consent of parliament, and which he contended was done in the present instance, by continuing to levy duties without any competent authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>admitted that it was an infraction of the law, and therefore his majesty's ministers came to parliament for indemnity. Admitting the general principle, as stated by the noble lord, he wished to be understood that this case must stand upon its own special circumstances, of which that house would judge when the subject came regularly before them.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0347"/>
<col>665</col>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>contended that the order of council for levying duties which had no legal existence was a violation of a most important constitutional principle, which ought to undergo the most serious discussion in that house. Ministers had advised his majesty to levy duties for a whole month without any legal authority, and now proposed to introduce a clause in the bill intended to be brought in to indemnify themselves for this violation of the law. He thought at least that house ought to have the opportunity of discussing the great question involved in this act of the ministers in a manner which its importance deserved, and not in the shape of a clause tacked to a money bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>considered the question of so much importance, that he deemed it necessary to move for the appointment of a committee to search for precedents since the year 1688, of money being levied or applied by the crown without the authority of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>explained the nature of the operation of the order of council, which in fact raised no new duties, and raised in many instances less duties, in no instance higher than the crown was legally entitled to after the expiration of the act under a former subsisting act.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville </member>, <membercontribution>contended that this statement did not alter the nature of the case. By levying lower duties than the crown was legally entitled to, might, in some instances, be levying more money than before, as in the case of prohibitory duties, in which, by lessening the duty, more money might be raised. It was still, therefore, a violation of the principles of the constitution, for which only urgent and imperious necessity could be pleaded, and if the necessity arose out of the late dissolution of parliament, it would still remain for ministers to account for their conduct in advising a dissolution of parliament, without making provision for the legal continuance of an act which they afterwards deemed it necessary to continue without legal authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>defended the expediency of the order of council, but admitted that it might be more adviseable to bring the indemnity as a separate measure before parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Harrowby</member> <membercontribution>urged that the order of council only went to carry into effect the last known intentions of the legislature; similar circumstances had repeatedly happened under almost every government, and in many instances an indemnity had not been applied
<col>666</col>
for. He conceived the motion of the noble lord (Holland) was not called for by any circumstances in the present case, which was nothing more than a mere formal violation of the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>observed that the argument of the noble lord (Harrowby) did not apply, as it was a matter of great doubt, whether the legislature would again continue the act; it therefore did not appear that ministers had carried into effect the intentions of the legislature.&#x2014;Some further observations were made by lords Hawkesbury, Auckland, Holland, Grenvile, Boringdon, the earls of Lauderdale, Roslyn, and the lord chancellor, after which lord Hawkesbury moved the previous question, which was put and carried.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>wished for some farther information with respect to any subsequent directions for carrying the order of council into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>said he would make the necessary inquiries.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL,]&#x2014;Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>moved for leave to present two bills for the amendment of the Judicature of that part of the united kingdom, called Scotland. His lordship stated, that there was nothing new in his motion, for that these bills were presented pursuant to resolutions passed in a former session, and which resolutions were framed, proposed and passed, with the avowed determination not to take the people of Scotland by surprise, but, on the contrary, to afford the most ample opportunity to that part of the united kingdom to deliberate upon, and maturely to consider the necessity and importance of passing the bills here proposed, without any unnecessary or further delay. If any delay had occurred in the passing of these bills, it was not the fault of the mover of the resolutions, in which it was expressly provided, that these bills should be passed in the present session, as their great and expedient advantages were called for, upon the admitted defects and insufficiency of the present mode of administering justice in Scotland. The titles of these bills were, a bill for the Amelioration of the Administration of Justice in Scotland, in certain Civil Causes, by the trial by Jury; and a bill for the better regulating the court of session in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>stated, that he was a friend to the principles of these bills, but that great difficulties having occurred in some of the clauses therein, he had proposed another bill, which he hoped would stand clear of several objections in the noble lord's
<image src="S1V0009P0I0348"/>
<col>667</col>
bills, or resolutions, and which bill, the lord Chancellor stated, he would bring forward in the next session of parliament, it being manifestly too late to introduce such a subject in this.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>replied, that as the subject of these bills was fully and universally understood, and imperiously called for, to put an end to an admitted and crying defect in the administration of justice in Scotland, there was abundant time for passing these bills, which had been so long considered and adjusted, unless it was the object of his majesty's ministers, to have, for their own convenience, dissolved the late parliament, and to make this so short, as that no efficient or important business could be done in it; which intention of the ministry would be fully evinced, by the result of this question, in rejecting, or even postponing these bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>said, he felt himself warranted in insisting on a notice, previous to the bringing these bills forward, although he felt no difficulty in asserting, that the great body of the Scotch nation were not for the change proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Athol</member> <membercontribution>stated, that he had taken care to make inquiries upon the subject, and found that it was not the general sense of the people of Scotland to have these bills passed at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Rosslyn</member> <membercontribution>stated that it was the general and prevailing sense of the country, that such bills were necessary, and that he wondered to hear such a change of sentiments in those noble lords, who in the last session were such strenuous approvers of the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>contended that these bills should not be postponed, on account of the act of the ministry, in dissolving the late parliament; as such a dissolution, unnecessary, in his opinion, caused much delay to many measures of urgent and important necessity. He stated, that the sense of that great and enlightened body, the Scotch bar, had been taken upon this subject, as also that of the commercial and mercantile interests of that country, which were in unison with the noble mover for the expediency and necessity of the speedy passing of these bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Athol</member> <membercontribution>again rose,and stated, that notwithstanding all the noble earl had said, he knew that the present measure was not the universal or general sense of the Scotch nation&#x2014; The bills were then read a first time and ordered to be printed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-06-29">Monday, June 29.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.] Sir S. Romilly</member> <membercontribution>obtained leave to bring in a bill for rendering the freehold property of persons subject to the bankrupt laws assets for the payment of their debts.&#x2014; On the motion of Mr. Long it was ordered, that there be laid before the house, an account of the expenditure of the British Museum in the years 1805 and 1806, together with an estimate of the expenditure of 1807.&#x2014;Mr. Rose presented a petition from the Trustees of the British Museum, setting forth, that the Trustees and administrators of the will of the late marquis of Lansdown have proposed to the consideration of the petitioners, the expediency of purchasing for the use of the public a valuable collection of manuscripts belonging to the said late marquis of Lansdown, chiefly concerning the public writings and records of this country, composed and collected by William lord Burghly, lord high treasurer in the reign of queen Elizabeth, sir Julius C&#x00E6;sar, master of the rolls and judge of the high court of admiralty in the reigns of queen Elizabeth and king James I., and other learned and eminent persons; and that there is already in the British Museum a very valuable and extensive collection of manuscripts important to the public, for the purpose of elucidating the public history of this country, and for furnishing evidence of the rights and possessions of individuals, to which the Lansdown collection of manuscripts would be a most valuable addition; but that the funds of the petitioners being insufficient for the common annual expenditure of the Museum without the accustomed aid of parliament, they are unable to provide for the purchase of the said collection of manuscripts; and therefore praying the house to take the matter into consideration, and to adopt such measures as to the house shall seem fit, for ascertaining the public importance of adding the Lansdown collection of manuscripts to those already lodged in the British museum, and also the value of such collection; and further to act therein as to, the House shall seem meet.&#x2014;Mr. Bankes, with a view to shew the progress that had been made towards rendering the British Museum useful in the degree that it ought to be to the public, moved, that there be laid before the house copies of all the Regulations adopted for the better preservation of the different collections, and for rendering them more accessible to artists and others;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0349"/>
<col>669</col>
and also, an account of the number of persons admitted to see the Museum, since the year 1805, distinguishing the year, month, &amp;c. Ordered.&#x2014; The house, on the motion of lord Castlereagh, went into a committee on his majesty's message, and resolved, <i>nem. con</i>., that a sum of 1000<i>l.</i> per, annum be granted to his majesty out of the Consolidated Fund, to be settled, during his natural life, on general sir John Stuart. The house then resumed, and the report was ordered to be received to-morrow.&#x2014;Petitions were presented, complaining of the late elections for Evesham and Downpatrick, which were severally fixed fir consideration on the 21st of July.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[OFFICES IN REVERSION BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion of Mr. Bankes, the resolution of the 24th of March last against granting Offices in reversion, was read, and leave was given to bring in a bill, similar to that pending when the late parliament was dissolved, for carrying the resolution into a law.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>took this opportunity of stating, that in the bill introduced by him in the last session, for abolishing certain useless offices, and for the better Regulation of other offices in Ireland, one had been omitted, which he had since found ought to have been included. He meant the office of Surveyor and Inspector of the River Ken mare; an office created a few years since, and granted to Sir Boyle Roche and J. Aylmer, esq. with benefit of survivorship. There was no Surveyor or Inspector, of the same description, for any other river in Ireland: it was quite a sinecure, with a salary of &#x00A3;300 a year, It had been, he knew not how, omitted in the Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry in Ireland, and therefore omitted in the bill brought in by him on that report.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Herbert <memberconstituency>(of Kerry)</memberconstituency></member> <membercontribution>said, that the river Kenmare lay principally in the county he had the honour to represent. Its course was forty miles long, and above five or six broad, with numberless creeks, and without a single Revenue Office in its vicinity to controul the smuggling exercised upon it, till this office had been created. The smuggling had, shortly after the appointment, been greatly reduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>was aware of the smuggling upon the river Kenmare; but that was a stronger reason for suppressing a useless sinecure, and substituting an active prevention.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Herbert</member> <membercontribution>explained. He meant that some inspection was necessary, The smug-
<col>670</col>
gling was not now so considerable as it had been before the creation of this office.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Arthur Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>said this office appeared, from what had been said, to be one of those that ought to be regulated, rather than suppressed. It was, however, subject to the disposal of parliament, as the vacancy created by the death of sir Boyle Roche had not been filled up, unless it had been by the late ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[RESOLUTIONS RELATING TO PRIVATE BILLS.] The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>acquainted the house, that, pursuant to the direction of the house, an account had been prepared of all Private Bills pending at the time of the late dissolution, with the several stages in which they were on the 27th of April, and those that were passed, with the exception of receiving the royal assent.&#x2014; The account was ordered to lie on the table, and ordered to be printed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>rose to submit to the house a motion, which he hoped would remove all the inconveniences affecting private bills, arising from the late dissolution of parliament. If, however, the house should estimate more highly than he did those inconveniences, those who had such a superior feeling of them, would, he trusted, be but more strongly compelled to adopt the resolution which went to remedy them. He was sure that those who regarded the dissolution as a crime not to be forgiven, would be disposed to visit the punishment of it wholly upon the advisers, without involving those who were but innocent sufferers. He never had said that the dissolution was not attended with inconvenience: it was merely on a comparison of that inconvenience with the superior importance of the reasons that rendered the dissolution necessary at that precise time, that he defended it. The principal inconveniences complained of were the delay and the additional expense. The delay of two months, he hoped, could not be attended with any material inconvenience; and as to the expense, it would be obviated in one of its branches by the liberality of the officers, who, according to the precedent established by their former liberality in 1784, agreed to advance the bills so pending at the dissolution, to their former stages, without any additional fees. It remained only to obviate the expense of agency, and the attendance of witnesses in town. This was the principal object of the resolution he meant to propose, which was to give an instruction to the committee, to which every petition for a private bill should be re-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0350"/>
<col>671</col>
ferred, to inquire whether any petition had already been presented in this late session, from the same parries, on the same subject; and if so, that the minutes of the evidence, taken before the committee on the former petition, should be evidence before the said committee; and so, in like manner, with respect to private bills, founded on such petitions, allowing the committees to call for further evidence, if necessary. He hoped that the inconveniences arising from the late dissolution to private business, would be in a great measure done away, by adopting this arrangement. Those who looked upon the dissolution as an evil which nothing could remedy, would not, of course, think this remedy satisfactory. But those who, On the contrary, looked upon it as a necessary appeal to the sense of the country, under the circumstances existing at the time, would be gratified to think that the inconveniences which the appeal occasioned, could be made so light. He concluded with moving a resolution accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>was ready to concur in every proper measure to lighten the inconveniences caused by the late dissolution. He, however, wished the house to consider, that to the serjeant at Arms, and others of the officers, the deficiencies of their fees beneath a certain amount was to be made good from the public purse, and this deficiency would of course be increased by remitting the fees.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Curwen</member> <membercontribution>could not reconcile himself to so dangerous a precedent as this, which by presenting a mode for relieving the private inconveniences incident to such a stretch of power, would always render it a matter of facility to a minister to dissolve parliament, in every case in which its temper and disposition might be adverse to his views. It was true, there had been a strong opposition to the late ministers on the two questions that had been tried touching the manner in which they had come into power. He had been one of those who had opposed them upon these questions, and he lamented that the decision upon them had not been different; for as it was, it tended to endanger the security of the crown, and of the country itself. He was sure, however, that no vexatious opposition had been intended; and if there had been, he would not have been a party to it. He lamented the inconveniences to private persons resulting from the dissolution; but though he wished to alleviate those inconveniences, he could not consent
<col>672</col>
to relieve them by opening door for public mischief.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>coincided in what had fallen from his hon. friend near him. However desirous of remedying the inconveniences occasioned by the dissolution (and every day shewed those inconveniences to be so great, that the period seemed to have been purposely chosen at which they must have been the greatest), he could not easily bring himself to consent to the measure now proposed to remedy those inconveniences. The magnitude of the inconveniences might indeed be well estimated, from the extraordinary nature of the remedy proposed. That remedy went to suspend and repeal for the time, the forms by which the privileges of the house of commons, and the rights and the property of the people, were secured and protected. However highly he might be disposed to commend the liberality of the clerks, it was not a very pleasant situation in which to place the house or the country, to make them dependent on that liberality. However it might answer in cases in which there was no opposition to allow the bills to proceed, without the necessity of bringing up witnesses, in cases of contest and opposition, the vast expence attending such cases must be again incurred. The necessary notices were not to be insisted upon, and individuals might find their property invaded, without any intimation to put them on their guard. It was impossible for him, in these circumstances, to consent to the arrangement proposed. If the right hon. gent. would but allow himself a pause of 24 hours, he would not think of pressing a measure, not only differing widely from all precedent, but violatory of every parliamentary principle. He recommended at least the appointment of a Committee to search into precedents. In 1784, though the expedient of forwarding the bills without fees had been adopted, no standing order had been violated. He again expatiated on the mischiefs attending the dissolution. He disclaimed all idea of vexatious opposition. Though there had necessarily been a decided opposition on the questions immediately touching the change of administration, and involving great constitutional principles, the decision that had been formed upon which he feared there would be cause to regret, there would not have been another division in the course of the session, unless something new had been brought forward. The Inclosure bills could not possibly be carried into effect, when passed at so late a period of the session.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0351"/>
<col>673</col>
The precedent was totally novel, and dangerous in its principle, and therefore he could not assent to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Perceval</member> <membercontribution>said, he could not hope to alter the noble lord's opinion, nor that of those who acted with him, as to the merits of the late dissolution. He was happy to think, however, that there was a great majority of the house, who were of opinion with him, that the prerogative was properly exercised in that instance. The importance of the circumstances that led to the dissolution were more than sufficient to counterbalance the private inconveniences. It was the great public interest that was to be consulted, and not private convenience. The noble lord was mistaken in supposing that any standing order was violated, or that the usual notice to parties was infringed upon. The standing order relative to notices required that they should be given at the Michaelmas, or in the August and September preceding the session in which the bill was to be brought in. The Michaelmas, the August, and the September that preceded the last session, were also the Michaelmas, August, and September preceding this, and therefore the same notice answered for the bills to be now brought in, The same construction had been put on the law of notices in the year 1784, and in the year 1800, in the first session of the United Parliament following the short session of the British parliament. He thought it rather a strange way of strengthening the argument derived from the inconveniences attending the dissolution, to refuse to alleviate those inconveniences.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, vindicated himself from the imputation of being disposed to add to the inconveniences arising from the dissolution, which he had every wish to remedy, so far as that could be done without creating public mischief. He denied the application of the precedents of 1784 and ,1800, in the most material circumstances. No resolution, like the present, had been then adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>objected to the resolution, as going to substitute written evidence for paroie evidence, with the power of personal examination.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr.Rose</member> <membercontribution>said, the committees were to be at liberty to call for parole evidence whenever they might think it necessary. He thought the house could by its own power obviate the difficulties touching the fees in every instance: for though the fees were, in some instances, appropriated by act of parliament,
<col>674</col>
they were levied only by a resolution of the house, which the house could dispose of according to its pleasure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>allowed that the power of the house might extend as far as the hon. gent. stated; but it would not, perhaps, be right, after the house had passed an act of approbation, to withdraw, the sums to be appropriated.&#x2014; After a few words from Mr. Bastard and sir J. Anstruther against the motion, Mr. Shaw Lefevre moved, that the debate be adjourned till to-morrow. This produced a short discussion between the chancellor of the exchequer, lord Howick, Mr. W. Smith, Mr. C. Wynne, and Mr. C. Dundas, in which it was contended, on the one hand, that there were no grounds, and on the other, that there were ample grounds for such a postponement. Upon which the house then divided: For the adjournment 76. Against it 164. The resolution was then put and carried.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[CONDUCT OF MARQUIS WELLESLEY]&#x2014;Lord Folkestone</member>, <membercontribution>entertaining still the same opinion that he had from the beginning, relative to the conduct of marquis Wellesley in the Oude transaction, moved, that the several Papers ordered with a view to the accusation and defence of the noble Marquis on that charge in the last session, be again laid before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Anstruther</member> <membercontribution>said, it must be equally the wish of all persons, as well those who disapproved of the administration of the noble marquis, as those who thought like him, that it was the brightest period of the British history in India; that as well on public as on private grounds, these charges so long pending should be brought to a decision as speedily as possible. As those who had been in the last and the preceding parliament, must have already made themselves masters of all the documents; and as there were in the vote office a sufficient number of copies to supply all the new members, he recommended, with a view to economy and expedition, that instead of renewing the general order for presenting and printing, the remaining copies should be distributed to the new members, and that the business should be decided oil as early a day as possible in this session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>expressed his willingness to promote a speedy decision, but with a fear that the present session, from the variety of other important business, would not in its short duration afford either sufficient time, or a sufficiently full attendance for this question.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>Mr. Creevey </member>, <membercontribution>from the difficulty of deciding in a case in which the noble marquis's friends thought his administration most useful, and the East India Company, according to a book published under the authority of the Court of Directors, represented it as the most injurious to their trade and revenue, as an absolute despotism, violatory of all the laws for the government of India, thought the present short session, occupied as it would be with a multiplicity of other important matters, would not afford a proper opportunity for coming to a determination upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Addington</member> <membercontribution>thought there was a combination of every private and public reason for coming to a decision as speedily as possible. Those who had been members of the last parliament, had read all the documents which had been ordered, he would say too precipitately, without the substantiation of a <i>prima facie</i> case of guilt. The papers in the vote office would supply the new members.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>said, it was not necessary that papers should be presented and printed in every new parliament, in order to afford ground for parliamentary proceedings. It was enough that they were in the custody of the house, and might be read. If the sense of the house should be to dispose of any papers in its stores to any particular description of members, it would be the duty of the Speaker to carry the wish of the house shortly into execution.&#x2014; In answer to a wish expressed by sir A. Wellesley, that a day should be appointed for the decision of the question, lord Folkestone stated, that for himself he was always ready to come to the discussion, but he could not fix any day without consulting others.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MEMORIAL OF SIR HENRY MILDMAY.]&#x2014;Sir Henry Mildmay</member> <membercontribution>rose, to give an explanation of some circumstances, which had caused much unmerited obloquy to be cast upon him. He did not wish to conceal the state of anxiety in which he was. But that anxiety arose from a fear, lest his abilities should not be sufficiently, adequate to the task; and lest the feelings of one, little accustomed to calumny, should render him incapable of giving a full explanation. That transaction was the only one he had ever had with government, or ever would have if he could help it. The fourth report of the Commissioners of Military Inquiry had been perverted for the purpose of casting aspersions on him; and it had been said, that he had received undue favours from govern-
<col>676</col>
ment, and had taken an undue advantage of the public. That charge was most false and unfounded; but he did not think himself called upon to answer anonymous aspersions, and had therefore waited with patience till the meeting of parliament gave him an opportunity of justifying himself. He felt that this explanation was due to the house, to himself, and to his constituents, but particularly to the administration of Mr. Addington (lord Sidmouth), during which the transaction had commenced; and more particularly still to one of the present lords of the Treasury (Mr. S. Bourne), who at one period of the affair had been secretary of the Treasury, which had exposed him, as well as himself, to a great deal of unjust calumny. In 1795, he had come into the possession of a large estate in Essex, on which he was obliged to reside three months in the year. The works began to be erected in 1803. During the time he resided there about 1500 people were engaged on them, which certainly did not render the residence the most desirable. All his tangible property on the outside of the house was in danger, and his family not very comfortable; but he still resided there till, nine nights out of ten, footpad robberies were committed in the fields near his house. He then thought that he had some claim to relief by law from the residence, and applied to Mr. Addington's administration for that purpose. He then was directed to apply to Mr. Vansittart, and obtained what he wanted. But the bill went only to relieve him for four years, and he was actually obliged to return to the place with all its inconveniences on the 24th of June next. If this was a job, it was singular that the administration should have jobbed against themselves, for he never gave them a vote in his life. He made the proposal of the house as a residence for the general of the district, to colonel Gordon, who told him that he could do nothing without a report from the barrack board. Their report was favourable, and he had a meeting with Mr. William Dundas, the Secretary at War, who said that it would be necessary to send a surveyor to examine the premises. Mr. Johnstone, the surveyor to the board, was then sent. He was totally unconnected with Mr. Johnstone, whom he had never seen in his life, and who had his own way in the whole affair. He made a report that &#x00A3;400 was a fair rent for the house and 20 acres about it. The house was furnished, as he had not removed one article. The house had cost &#x00A3;70,000. He had received at &#x00A3;200
<image src="S1V0009P0I0353"/>
<col>677</col>
for repairs and &#x00A3;400 a year for rent. On the 24th of June, 1804, the bargain was made, but the lease was not signed as general Delancey left the board. The rent was, however, due from that period. As to the letters from one department to another, he had nothing to do with them, and never saw them till they appeared in the report. By the general's residing in it, the government would save money. For their repairs he was not obliged to them, as he wished to have the house pulled down. But he had received no atom of compensation for being turned out of doors. On the 18th of August a jury was impannelled&#x2014;one would think from the report that it was in 1803; but it was in 1804, which made a very material difference. On that occasion he employed the agent that generally acted for the gentlemen in that Part of the country. The agent employed counsel; but he had given him no instructions to do so, and knew nothing of it. The jury was one of the most respectable that ever sat, and did not give a rash or hasty verdict, for they were locked up three hours before they agreed upon it. They gave a verdict of &#x00A3;1300 for thirty acres one rood, &amp;c. on which the military works stood. But he would ask, if there was a single word in the verdict that prevented him from living in the house or pulling it down, if he thought proper: and a surveyor had valued the materials of the house at &#x00A3;10,000, which would produce &#x00A3;500 a year. Was there any thing that prevented him from letting the house to the Speaker of the house of Commons, to government, or to any one else? The thirty acres for the military works, had nothing whatever to do With the Barrack Office agreement as to the house and 20 acres. The furniture for such a house was worth a good round sum. This estate was worth above &#x00A3;11,000, and had a suitable house. For this &#x00A3;400 a year was no adequate compensation. He wished that the value of the furniture of the house could be ascertained, or to what sum the fair annual valuation would have amounted; and he also wished to know, what gentleman who heard him, having such a house, so furnished, would have considered &#x00A3;400 a year an equivalent. He appealed to those who had known him for many years, whether, in his conduct, he had evinced any thing which could induce them to believe him capable of a transaction, such as this had been described to be. His estate in Essex had been granted to his ancestors by Henry VIII. He repeated
<col>678</col>
the question, was &#x00A3;400 a year a compensation? He had been told that the Grand Junction Canal had to go through lord Essex's Park, and he would be contented with one-fourth of the compensation from government that lord Essex received from private individuals. The noble lord over the way (lord Howick) had hinted, that he was unfit to sit on the Committee of Finance, on account of the facts that were stated in the Report. This was certainly premature decision. The Military Commissioners themselves had said that no imputation rested on him. They only said that the Barrack Board had made a negligent bargain for the public; at all events, he would not be a moment longer in possession of this lease, and he in treated of his majesty's ministers to have a fresh jury impannelled. He wished to justify himself, and would answer any questions that should be put to him, either at the Bar of the House, in his place, or in a Court of Justice. As he had spoken from memory, some subordinate points might not be accurately stated, but the substance was correct. He concluded by moving for the production of a Memorial which he had that day given in to the Commissioners of Military Inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member> <membercontribution>seconded the motion. He rose,. he said, in consequence of the calumnies that had been circulated against, him, which he regarded less on his own account than on account of his hon. friend. Indeed, they would have been unworthy of notice if they had not been echoed by the noble lord over the way (lord Howick).He seemed to have looked at the newspaper report rather than at the Report of the commissioners. His name had not occurred in the Report, except where it was found at the bottom of one letter on this subject. He had been told that the age of insinuation was past, but if it was so, he was very unfortunate, for no one had met with more insinuations. He hoped the practice of making insinuations on account of private friendships, would be done away. He had no concern with the origin of the business, and yet he was accused of giving 630<i>l.</i> for repairs instead of the estimated 250<i>l.</i> and that because he had not chosen to deny a charge in the newspaper, but had waited for the meeting of that house. The business came to his notice officially in 1805, and the reason was, that by a late regulation no issue could be made for the Barrack-Board above 500<i>l.</i> without a communication to the Treasury; and the application was not mis-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0354"/>
<col>679</col>
understood, nor passed over with out attention, as had been said. The object at that time was not the policy of the agreement, for that had been determined and acted on, and the repairs had been done. The Treasury, therefore, gave its authority, though sensible of the disadvantage of the terms. In every instance of this sort a jury gave a large compensation, and so it ought to do, where the one party had no choice. It fell to his lot as secretary to the treasury, to communicate the determination to the Barrack-Board; but the object was not to execute the lease, for that had been done already. Some of the gentlemen on the other side must know the course of the Treasury. He was answerable for any mistake in the letter, but when he had to sign so many, it was not surprising that a mistake should have occurred in one, which it was not thought required any very minute attention. The letter ought not to have alluded to repairs at all, and the gentlemen must have known that the letter admitted of a different construction from what they had put upon it, Having stated this, he left it to the house to judge of the fairness of their proceedings. He would ask the noble lord (H. Petty), whether he had found that he had ever been apt to make use of his official situation to serve his friends particularly? The charge against him was false, foul, and scandalous, and he had only to say that he had much rather be the object of it than the author.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Martin</member> <membercontribution>considered the bargain as highly advantageous to the hon. baronet, and ruinous to the public, and therefore contended that the matter should be inquired into. It appeared to him also objectionable, that the hon. baronet, in justifying himself, seemed to impute blame to the Military Commissioners. He did not mean to say that the hon. baronet intended to do so; but the consequence that would follow from his statement was, that the commissioners did not understand the transaction. The compensation of 1300<i>l.</i> awarded by the jury for the first year for thirty acres, amounted to the fee simple of the land. The hon. and learned gent. made some further observations on the terms of the bargain, and contended that the matter should be enquired into. It was desirable, particularly at this moment, to show that the reports of these commissioners were deserving of credit, When they had made so small a progress in the subjects they had to investigate. He knew the commissioners to be men of as much honesty, integrity, and principle, as any gentle-
<col>680</col>
men in that house, and was sure they had no intention to make any unfavourable report against the hon. baronet. When the matter should again be brought before the house, he hoped the hon. baronet would be prepared to explain, why no person, had attended on the part of the crown, to take care of the interests of the public, He was much misinformed, or it was the duty of the person who was counsel to the Board of Ordnance, to attend under the defence act, upon such occasions, if directed. This explanation would relieve his mind from a suspicion, not of the hon. baronet, but of the negligence of the public boards.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>approved in warm terms of the candid statement made by his hon. friend. He did think it an ingenusous statement, and he hoped that the gentlemen who were so ready to charge would prove equally ingenuous in their own defence when called upon under any circumstances that might hereafter arise to vindicate themselves. He censured the manner in which the calumnies of the daily publications had been sanctioned by the authority of the noble lord (Howick), and contended that such calumnies would have sunk into their merited oblivion, had they not received a sort of stamp and currency from what had recently passed within that house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>said, that in the very few words he should feel it necessary to say upon the present subject, he should cautiously abstain from following the example of the right hon. secretary, by trying to divert the attention of the house from a serious charge affecting one of its members, by a vague recrimination, equally inapplicable and groundless. He did not blame, he rather approved of the hon. baronet's refusing to answer the newspaper attacks that bad been made upon him; and though the right hon. secretary had accused him (lord Howick) of sanctioning newspaper calumnies, he had been so much more the object than the promoter of such attacks, that he did not think such insinuation in any respect just towards him. He would not retort the charge upon the right hon. secretary, though, at the same time, he could not forget the keen and poignant wit that in other times had distinguished the papers of the Anti-jacobin. As to the other hon. gent. (Mr. S. Bourne) he had never imputed to him any timing more than negligence, which might naturally be the consequence of a great multiplicity of business; but he had satisfaction in saying, that so far as that gentleman was concerned, he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0355"/>
<col>681</col>
was totally exculpated. He felt it a painful duty to state, that he was not satisfied with the explanation given by the hon. baronet. He censured any blustering attempt upon the part of his majesty's ministers, to influence that house in its decision on the present case; if the cause of the hon. baronet was a bad one, the injudiciousness of the defence might tend to aggravate the crime, and if it was a good one, it was certainly most impolitic to attempt to controul, when it could so easily convince. This was not a time to resist inquiry by menacing challenges; the country expected inquiry, and recrimination would prove but a bad method to evade it. If there was calumny in this attack upon the hon. baronet, that calumny was to be found in the Fourth Report of the Commissioners of Military Inquiry, and surely no member in that house was to be censured for not at once discrediting and denouncing that Report, though not one title had been yet offered by the hon. baronet or his friends in denial of its statements. As to what had fallen from him (lord Howick) upon a former night, with respect to the reappointment of the hon. baronet on the Finance Committee, he was willing to repeat, that till this transaction was fully explained to the satisfaction of parliament, and the public, he did think it most inadviseable to allow that gentleman's name to appear on the list of a committee appointed for looking with a jealous caution to the expenditure of the public money. He had said that the hon. baronet's explanation had not satisfied him; and why? because that explanation did not in any way go to disprove what had been stated, that the public had paid twice for the same thing. This had not been cleared up, and until it was, he could not, consistently with his duty to that house and the public, totally acquit the hon. baronet.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>justified the hon. gent. (Mr. S. Bourne) from the imputation against him. So far as he had an opportunity of judging, there appeared no ground to suspect that hon. gent. of any corrupt practice while Secretary of the Treasury.&#x2014;After a few words from general Hope, Mr. P. Carew, Mr. Montague, the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr. Ashley, and lord H. Petty, the motion was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<p>[PRIVATE BILLS.] The <i>Lord Chancellor</i> stated, that, upon consideration, he thought it most expedient that the first step towards the relief of parties interested in Private Bills, which had been interrupted by
<col>682</col>
the dissolution, should be to take into consideration the Standing Orders. He therefore moved that the Standing Orders relative to Private Bills, should be taken into consideration on Thursday, on which day he intended to move with respect to such bills, four propositions; first, That with respect to petitions for bills, upon which reports had been made last session, such reports should be taken as of this session, without a new reference, provided the renewed petitions were in substance the same as those presented last session. Secondly, that instead of a fortnight being required to elapse previous to the commitment of a bill of this description, a week only should be necessary. Thirdly, that the evidence taken last session in committees on Private Bills, should be referred to the committees on the renewed bills, with a proviso that such new committee should not be concluded by such evidence, but should be at liberty to call such further evidence as they might deem necessary; and fourthly, that the Standing Orders in other respects should be strictly complied with.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Grenville</i> acquiesced generally in the mode proposed by the noble and learned lord, and thought that whatever difference of opinion there might be with respect to the late dissolution of parliament, there should be a general disposition to give relief to the parties interested in private bills as far as such relief was consistent with the dignity of the house, and with justice to all parties.&#x2014;The Standing Orders, together with the propositions of the lord chancellor, were ordered to be taken into consideration on Thursday.</p>
<p>[AMERICAN TRADE BILL.] Lord <i>Hawkesbury,</i> in consequence of the wish expressed by a noble lord (Grenville) on the preceding evening, for further information respecting the Order of Council, stated, that the only proceeding had was the usual circular letter from the Treasury to the Officers of Customs and Excise, to conform to the regulations contained in the act.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Grenville</i> moved for the production of this circular letter; and also an account of the rates of duties levied under the act; adding to the latter motion, on the suggestion of lord Hawkesbury, an account of the rates of duties payable by law after the expiration of the act alluded to.&#x2014;Agreed to.</p>

<date format="1807-06-30">Tuesday, June 30.</date>
<p>[BRITISH AND FOREIGN SHIPPING] Mr. <i>Eden</i> rose to move for a return of the British and foreign ships employed in the British trade for the last three years; he said
<image src="S1V0009P0I0356"/>
<col>683</col>
he had been induced to make such a motion, as he thought, if it could be complied with, the house would be enabled to judge how far the shipping interest had been affected by the measures of the late administration. He was sure the house would be convinced, as he was, that notwithstanding the contrary assertions of his majesty's ministers, the British ships had increased 1&#x2013;6th in the course of the last year, while the foreign vessels had diminished in nearly the same proportion. Of the serious accusations advanced against the late ministers, the chief source (as alledged by those who made them) was the American Intercourse act, which, to use the very words of the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Rose) "did for our enemies what they could not do for themselves"; if that was the case, he wondered that ministers had not before now availed themselves of the opportunity their present situations gave them, of repealing an act of such dangerous consequences, and restoring the British navy to its original footing, or as Robespierre was known to have said, "to starve the colonies, rather than give up an iota of their principles." The late ministers had been charged with having made fatal concessions to the neutral flags; he trusted, however, that those who had succeeded them would not, by any rash or precipitate measures, hurry us into those evils such concessions were so well calculated to prevent; he trusted their rashness would not end in a rupture with America. In 1801, the Russian Convention was concluded upon, by which Russia gave up the treaty of 1756. Did the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer intend to carry into office with him those sentiments which in opposition made him despise all commercial advantages however extensive or important, which were to be held through neutral flags? He hoped he did not, and from the silence of the right. hon. gentleman and his colleagues, upon the American Intercourse act, he was inclined to believe that in this respect that right hon. gent. fortunately for the country, had abandoned those principles, which while out of power directed his opposition to this measure. He wished the house to examine attentively these accounts, which he now moved for; they would enable the house to form a just estimate of the accusation which had been thrown upon the late ministry, for neglect of the shipping interest; so far from having suffered from the measures adopted by the late ministers, he would take upon him to assert, that for the last year the number of British ships had increased in a proportion unexampled for the
<col>684</col>
same time in any former war, notwithstanding the diminution that must naturally arise out of the high rates of insurance during a continuance of hostilities. He concluded with moving, That there be laid before the House an Account of British and Foreign Shipping employed in the British trade for the last three years, ending 5th of January, 1807; shewing the number of vessels, tons, and men, entered inwards and cleared outwards, in each year.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Rose</i> said, he had no objection to the motion, but could not see what object it could answer. As to the number of British vessels in the British Trade, it was not possible for the late ministers, during their short stay in office, to have diminished it in any considerable proportion. As to the American Intercourse bill, he had no hesitation in repeating what he had when out of office stated to the house, that he thought it an act big with the worst consequences to our West India trade. A right hon. friend of his had been asked yesterday, whether it was intended to propose the repeal of this act? Did it follow, that because the measure might be objected to on its being proposed, that after its adoption it ought to be repealed? It was a different thing to oppose a law before it was made, and to repeal it when made. While the bill alluded to was pending, he thought it would be highly mischievous; in that opinion he was confirmed. It gave the Americans such advantages, that the British shipping were almost driven out of the trade. He had been lately applied to, by an agent of Jamaica, for a convoy to secure the little trade carrying on there in British bottoms, but he thought the advantages on the side of the Americans, as to cheapness of insurance, number of vessels, and shortness of distance, too great for the British vessels to rival them in that trade. He had however, no objection to the motion of the hon. gent. though he felt it difficult to discover what object could be attained by it, and thought it by no means justifiable to throw out any hint or disrespectful insinuations against such a weighty and respectable body as the shipping interest of this country.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Howick</i> thought the observations made by the right hon. gent. who had just sat down, the most extraordinary he had ever heard; was it to be believed, that there was a man in that house who could so far have mistaken his hon. friend who had made this motion, as to infer from what had fallen from him in support of it, any thing like contempt towards the shipping interest? His hon. friend, in the speech he had made,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0357"/>
<col>685</col>
had evinced a knowledge of the subject now before the house, utterly irreconcilable with any sentiment towards the shipping interest, but that of respect. At the same time he professed to entertain the same sentiments for that body, it certainly did appear, that they were induced, under the influence of erroneous apprehensions, to petition that house against measures which were not of the nature that respectable body were led to believe; they were not productive of the consequences that certain persons were desirous of attributing to them; in this respect they were certainly misled by various reports, insidiously set on foot and industriously propagated, and the house knew well how great bodies might for a time be misled by insinuations disseminated in that way. But what particularly induced him now to trespass on the indulgence of the house was, what had fallen from the right hon. gent. That right hon. gent. had been bold enough to declare that he believed the American Intercourse act had been productive of the most injurious consequences to the British trade in the West Indies, and after so stating, the right hon. gent. avowed that he had no intention of moving for the repeal of an act he thought so injurious; but there was even a shorter process&#x2014;the repeal might not be necessary. If he understood the act, it was this, a bill to empower the king in council to permit an Intercourse, &amp;c. which, therefore, implied the right of withholding that permission; consequently all that ministers had to do, if they really thought this measure attended with such danger, was to suspend the intercourse: but if they should hesitate to do that, he did not know how to reconcile their professions with their practice. The right hon. gent. complained of the evils which have caused the decline of our trade, compared with that of the Americans in that quarter; would the right hon. gent. take upon him to say, that all those evils have sprung up within the last 12 months, or had they not existed for the last 14 years? and if they had been accumulating within that period, was it fair or candid to attribute them to a cause so foreign from them, for the mere pretence of justifying his friends by attempting to criminate their predecessors? All the reasons that existed then, for a more vigorous Order of Council, existed still; the famous decree of the 21st of Nov. was now, as then, in full force against our commerce, and the power of the French government to enforce it, was as strong as ever. God grant that power was not now
<col>686</col>
alarmingly greater! Why then not substitute for that order of council, which had been thought so weak and futile, another of more vigour, and able to effect all that the present ministers, when in opposition, had said that it ought to effect?</p>
<p>The <i>Chancellor of the Exchequer</i> said, he rose merely to observe upon the candour with which the hon. mover had charged him with rashness and precipitancy, in adopting measures which had not yet been adopted. He repeated what he had before said upon the order in council, and thought that if the decree of the 21st of Nov. had been then more firmly met by his majesty's then ministers, such firmness would have been productive of the best possible results; but it did not at all follow, though he then condemned that order, that now, under different circumstances, and at such a distance of time, he should be bound to advise its being entirely abandoned; he should, however, assent to the motion.</p>
<p>Sir <i>C. Price</i> vindicated the shipping interest.</p>
<p>Lord <i>H. Petty</i> said, that the hon. baronet must have totally misconceived his hon. friend, if he understood him to have said any thing disrespectful of the shipping interest; as to the petitions that had been, day after day, presented to that house, in the course of the late parliament, he should not say by what misrepresentations that body had been induced to present them, but this he would say, that that body had but partially acted, for certain he was that a great part of the shipping interest had nothing to do in presenting such petitions: but what he rose to notice, was the extraordinary ground taken by the right hon. chancellor of the exchequer; that gentleman would now abstain, forsooth, from more vigorous measures, in order that he might not incur the charges of rashness and precipitancy; and what had been the answer of the same right hon. gent. to the statements of his hon. friend? it was contended, that all the benefits resulting within the last year to the shipping interest, by which the number of British ships in the British trade had been increased in so considerable a proportion, that all those benefits could not within the short space of a year be attributed to the late ministers, because in so short a time they could have done no considerable harm, while it had been at the same time contended, that all the evils ailedged to have arisen out of the intercourse act, were to be attributed to the late ministers within the same short year. With what candour
<image src="S1V0009P0I0358"/>
<col>687</col>
the right hon. gent. could refer to the late ministers the evils that had been accumulating for the last 14 years, and deny to the same men the merit of the good effects of their own measures within a year, he left it to the house to determine.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Castlereagh</i> contended that the policy of the present question, as affecting the order of council, was widely different from what presented itself to the late ministers.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Temple</i> observed, that the order of council was issued after the Treaty with America.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary <i>Canning</i> denied that ministers were bound to look to the order of council under the circumstances existing when it was issued, but under present circumstances. At the same time, he had no hesitation in declaring, that he thought that order partook of all the bad qualities of half measures, attended with all the inconveniences of strong measures, without being productive of any of their good consequences.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Whitbread</i> recapitulated the arguments advanced by his noble friend (lord Howick), and concluded with saying, that he seldom knew any good consequences to arise from the over-strained violence of blustering politicians.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Canning,</i> in explanation, said, that he was not aware of having deviated from the question; but at all events he should rather appear in the character of an injudicious adviser than in that of a blundering accuser.</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Laurence</i> contended, that the present ministers were pledged to repeal the act, which in opposition they had argued, and still professed, to be destructive to the British trade in the West Indies. All that was in their power to do the late ministers had done, as far as related to the altering or abolishing, what, when out of power, they had condemned. They had not been idle in plucking up the numberless thorns and briars from the bed of roses they had been placed in&#x2014;the measure was under consideration, was not dependent upon circumstances, it was the same now as five months ago, and therefore it was a mere pretence for ministers to say, that though they condemned it five months ago, it was not now expedient to abolish it. There was no way of proving to the house they were sincere in their opposition to it, but by repealing it at once. They professed it to be dangerous, they denounced it as injurious to British commerce, that its operation had done mischief, and continued to do mischief, and yet they did not think it right to repeal, or even
<col>688</col>
temporarily to suspend it. And all who presumed to complain of such satisfactory explanation, and self-evident consistency, were to be derided as "blundering accusers." But, continued the learned doctor, these polite terms, as applied to my hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread) are intended, I suppose, to convey something beyond the present question. The man who was impeached by this house, as a public peculator, had been acquitted, it would seem, not because of his own innocence, but on account of the "blundering" manner in which the accusations, however grounded, were preferred against him; was this to go abroad to the public? we all know the right hon. secretary's love for an epigram; but if this was meant to be in point, it was as cruel a blunder at the expence of the accused, as the most blundering accuser could be guilty of.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>M. Montague</i> said, he thought that instead of waging this war of words about a measure which had already passed into a law, and that as his majesty's present ministers had not had sufficient time to determine as to their future conduct in relation to it, the house would do much better to pass on to the many very important matters which awaited their consideration.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</p>
<p>[BREACH OF PRIVILEGE&#x2014;NEWSPAPER MISREPRESENTATION.]&#x2014;Mr. <i>Sturges Bourne</i> rose to complain of a breach of privilege, and spoke as follows:&#x2014;It was my misfortune, sir, to have to trouble the house last night, in consequence of the foul and ignorant calumnies of which I have been for the last month so undeservedly the object, and which the editor of a Morning Paper has been so active in propagating; two noble lords over against me (lords Howick and H. Petty) in that manly and honourable manner which became their character and station, bore witness to my innocence, and declared me in their minds wholly exculpated. This part of the proceedings on that subject, so essential to my character, were suppressed by the editor of the Morning Chronicle, in the same spirit with which he has vented his libellous aspersions against my integrity and my honour. The house must be aware that I should now be justified in calling this person to the bar, but this step I shall forego, contenting myself with having thus stated the circumstances, which I thought it my duty to state, feeling, as I do, that no such misrepresentation of the proceedings of this house, should be suffered, and particularly in any question that involves the personal
<image src="S1V0009P0I0359"/>
<col>689</col>
feelings and character of any of its members. In stating this, I feel that there cannot be in this house a man who more highly values the liberty of the press than I do, but the house will see that those who so abuse it are its worst enemies. I shall take no further proceedings in this case, but if a similar one should occur, in that or any other paper, I shall feel it my duty to enforce the standing order of the house.</p>
<p>[BRITISH TROOPS IN THE WEST INDIES.] Mr. <i>Cochrane Johnstone</i> called the attention of the house to the dreadful mortality of our troops in the West Indies, and described the causes to which, in his opinion, it was generally to be attributed. These were, chiefly, the want of air in the barracks and their improper situation on the coast. The barracks in the West India Islands, had no ventilators, and on entering them, the smell, in consequence, was most offensive. It was well known, that when the thermometer was under 83 degrees, the yellow fever was not to be apprehended; and it was also well known, that the sea coast, where the barracks were usually built, was considerably hotter than the interior of the Islands. A striking instance of this occurred to himself. He had the command of a regiment 1000 strong, quartered on the coast of one of the West India Islands. In the month of July the yellow fever broke out among them. In four weeks 550 men died. He marched the remainder into the interior, and he had the satisfaction to find, that the ravages of the disorder were completely stopped. In the year 1801, no less than 3000 of our troops died in the West India Islands. A great cause of the mortality was, that the British troops were employed in garrisons. By abstaining from this practice, and by adopting other regulations, he was convinced that the West India Islands might be made as healthy as any station at home. He painted very feelingly the dreadful situation of many of the subalterns in that country, compelled to subsist on 5s. 8d. a day; and declared, that to the humanity of the women of colour, many a British Officer owed his existence. When the ill health of an officer procured him leave to return home, it became necessary for him to raise 50 or 60l. to pay for his passage; in many cases this was impracticable, and it was an evil which ought to be remedied. These observations were the unfortunate result of his experience for many years. He had no doubt that the noble lord who was at the head of the colonial department would pay every attention to the
<col>690</col>
subject; but he hoped the house would appoint a committee to inquire into these evils, and to endeavour to find means to counteract them. Were they not counteracted, it would be better to withdraw every man of our army from that country. As a preliminary step, he moved, "That there be laid before the house an Account of the Mortality that had taken place in the Troops sent to the West Indies, from the 1st. of Jan., 1797, to the 1st. of Jan., 1807, distinguishing the Officers from the Privates, and specifying the names of the Officers."&#x2014; Mr. Biddulph seconded the motion.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Castlereagh</i> did every justice to th motives of the hon. gent.; but, however important the subject, he was rather inclined to think, that it was not one on which a committee of the house of commons was the body most qualified to prosecute an inquiry. In his opinion, it would be better to leave it to the executive government, unless, indeed, it was suspected that they were asleep on their posts, and inattentive to a matter of such moment. The papers moved for by the hon. officer, would not afford the information which he desired. An account of the number of deaths in the troops sent out, would convey an undue impression. It should rather be in the troops who were serving. Certainly, there was a strong feeling in the public mind of the great mortality in the army in the West Indies. He was anxious to reduce that feeling by proving that the apprehensions were exaggerated. Within the last ten years, such attention had been paid to this important point, that a striking diminution had taken place in the proportionate number of deaths, which at the present time amounted to only one third of what they were ten years ago. It could hardly be hoped to make the West Indies as healthy as at home; but a great deal might yet be done. He would set himself diligently to the task, and he should be glad to profit by the advice and suggestions of the hon. officer. When he before held the seals of the colonial department, considerable investigations had been instituted on this subject, with a view to ameliorate the condition of the British army on the West India service.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Windham</i> observed, that much of the mortality of the troops arose from causes that could not be remedied, as inseparable from tropical climates. As to the suggestion of the hon. gent. not having been acted upon, he had only to remind him that a great variety of opinions prevailed upon the subject among officers of great experience. The same was
<image src="S1V0009P0I0360"/>
<col>691</col>
the case, with respect to the advantage a Floating Hospitals over Hospitals on shore. He had listened with attention to the suggestion of the hon. gent., but the question could not be decided, except by persons of considerable experience. As to the situation of the barracks, regard must be had to the defence of the Islands. The statement of the hon. gent. would be good, as a stimulus to government. As to the pay of subalterns being insufficient to procure them the comforts that every one would wish them to have, the case was the same in every other service, and only proved that a person who entered the military profession, should, like him who engaged in other vocations, have some capital, when he entered it, as he had said last year, when he proposed a small addition to the pay of subalterns.</p>
<p>The <i>Secretary at War</i> was perfectly convinced of the propriety of the motives of the hon. gent. in bringing forward this subject, but he could assure the house, that the attention of his majesty's servants was particularly called to it, as the regiment which he had the honour to command had been employed on service in the West Indies. He was of opinion that great advantage would be derived from attending to this matter; but he was not sanguine enough to expect, that by any arrangements that could be adopted, the health of the troops could be preserved as well as in Europe. When his regiment had been sent out first they were quartered in Stony Hill Barracks, in Jamaica, situated according to the idea of the hon. gent. and yet the regiment had suffered considerable sickness. He thought that much benefit would result from the adoption of improved arrangements respecting the Barracks, but on the other points considerable difference of opinion prevailed amongst experienced officers.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>W Smith</i> said, that the arguments of the noble lord tended to put aside all enquiry by a committee of that house, which he could not agree to. An enquiry by a committee might sometimes be of great use. The noble lord had said, that the deaths had decreased one-third in the last ten years. He made no doubt but if an enquiry had taken place previous to that time, the decrease would have been still greater. There was another point of view in which an enquiry might hereafter be of great importance, viz. as to our West India possessions, and what was the amount of the expence in men or money of maintaining them. He supposed, however, the noble lord and ministers would do their duty, and would, therefore, recommend to the hon.
<col>692</col>
officer not to press his motion at present.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>C. Johnstone</i> said, he never would have brought this matter before the house, but that he had been refused attention to it by ministers. He believed he was the first officer who applied to the right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham) on the subject, and thought it would have been immediately laid before the commander in chief, and a Board of General Officers appointed to enquire into it. No alteration had been made, and if something was not done in the course of the next twelve months, he would annually submit a similar motion to the house. He had no objection to withdraw his motion at present, but he conjured ministers to press the matter on the Commander in Chief, and to have a Board of General Officers appointed, for it was a subject on which there ought not to be any further delay.&#x2014;The motion was then withdrawn.</p>
<p>[FINANCE COMMITTEE]&#x2014;The <i>Chancellor of the Exchequer,</i> pursuant to his notice, in consequence of the general sense of the house, and in obedience to the recommendation in the lords commissioners speech, for the renewal of those inquiries which had been interrupted by the late dissolution of parliament, rose to move for the renewal of the Finance Committee. In recommending the proposition he had to submit to the house, it was unnecessary for him to enlarge upon the importance of such inquiries to the public interest, because no difference of opinion existed, no objection was felt to the revival of the committee. The only question upon which any difference would arise was, as to the appointment of the committee, and the persons whom the house might think proper to select. He had reason to think, that a difference of opinion would prevail on this subject, because he had, on a former night, heard expressions from the other side of the house, that the gentlemen there would be disappointed, if all the members of the former committee, who were now members of the house, should not be appointed. He was sensible of the inexpediency of such an appointment, that though he should propose to continue some of the members of that committee, he should leave out others, in order to make room for the introduction of members of a different description. The noble lord opposite (lord Howick) had said, that all the members of the committee ought to be appointed, except two, his hon. friend (Mr. S. Bourne), and the hon. baronet (sir H. Mildmay) who had, on the preceding day, made a satisfactory
<image src="S1V0009P0I0361"/>
<col>693</col>
statement in his justification from the charge which had been imputed to him. He should follow, therefore, in that instance, the advice of the noble lord, and not press the appointment of either of his hon. friends; and as the noble lord, who had originally recommended the committee, had not appointed any person in office, he should adhere to his precedent. His hon. friend (Mr. S. Bourne) being now in office, would not, therefore, be proposed on the committee, though acquitted by the noble lord opposite of the charge urged against him; and the hon. baronet, acting under the influence of a sense of delicacy greater than the occasion called for, had requested that he might not be proposed, as it appeared to be the opinion of some members of the house of commons, that some farther explanation was necessary.&#x2014;He could not help here calling to the recollection of the house the manner in which the committee had been originally appointed, so different from any committee that had ever been appointed in parliament, and composed almost exclusively of one description of persons. There were only two persons upon it, who could be supposed, from their parliamentary conduct, to be friendly to the present administration; three others were not biassed towards either party, and all the rest were such as would de disposed to view subjects in the same light with the noble lord (hear! hear!). A committee so appointed could not be impartial, or answer the expectations of the house or the public. As he did not mean to enlarge the number beyond 25, the number of which the former committee had consisted, because that was the greatest number that could conveniently assemble for business, he meant to exclude some of the former members, in order to introduce others, for the more impartial constitution of the committee. The five that had been removed by the event of the election, were not enough for that purpose, and the house would in its discretion decide upon that point. In the appointment of the committee also, he meant to adopt the suggestion of the noble lord, by giving the preference to the appointment of it openly to a ballot. It was his opinion, however, that the appointment by ballot was in general to be preferred. Nothing could be more invidious than the discussing whether any particular individual was a proper person to be appointed on the committee; and the fitness of persons to act together upon such a committee, could be better consulted by individuals making out their lists, for a
<col>694</col>
ballot. He had acceded, however, to the suggestion of the noble lord, because he should thereby get rid of any suspicion that any thing was intended, which he was afraid to avow openly. Before he made any motion, he should read over the list of the committee he meant to propose, in order that the house might see whether he had not retained the most efficient members of the late committee. He had already stated the necessity of making some alteration in the constitution of the committee, because there were many acts of the last administration which would be subjects of inquiry. He could state many facts which would induce the house not to trust with implicit confidence to those, who were disposed only to praise the late administration, and who, by their overbearing authority in the committee might keep back the inquiries into their particular acts. The late ministers had expressed themselves, on the first appointment of the committee, very much averse to the grant of places in reversion; there was, however, the instance to which his attention had been called, of their having a short time before they went out of office, appointed two offices in reversion of a most extraordinary nature; he alluded to the appointment of a Collector and Surveyor of Customs in the port of Buenos Ayres, a place not then in the possession of his majesty. These were reversionary grants to take place upon an uncertain contingency, and made by those gentlemen who appeared to be so nice on this subject. (hear, hear!)&#x2014;He had, on a former occasion, stated, without giving any opinion upon the propriety of appointing such officers, the nomination of 300 Surveyors of Taxes. The nomination was founded on a representation from the Commissioners of Taxes, made in March, 1806, but the appointment could not take place till the business was submitted to parliament. When the dissolution took place in October, without any sanction of parliament having been obtained for these appointments, the persons were designated to the offices, in the way the noble lord had said on a former night: members of parliament waited on the minister, they were received civilly, and the promise made. But the parliament met in December, and sat some months; the measure for sanctioning the appointment was not brought forward, and the hon. gentlemen opposite, when they lost the power of performance, were compelled to revert to the condoling letters which he had before alluded to. This circumstance would induce the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0362"/>
<col>695</col>
house not to place implicit or peculiar confidence in those gentlemen, who viewed every thing in the same light as the late administration. Another appointment made by the late administration, was that of Gazette Writer, created by patent, for Scotland, with a salary of &#x00A3;300 per annum. This office had been before divided between the editors of three newspapers (hear! hear!). He wished the hon. gentlemen to hear his statement, and to bear in mind that the business of the office was performed by these three persons, without any expence to the public, though they made a profit of &#x00A3;200 a year by the publications in their newspapers. These persons had been turned out of their employments, and an appointment by patent given to the present possessor; and he should ask whether any gentleman believed that this had been done with any other view than to give the place to that person? He should not dwell in detail upon all the acts of the late ministers, but he confessed himself at a loss to understand what they could mean by the appointment of a Professor of Medical Jurisprudence. (a laugh, and hear! hear!). He acknowledged that he was ignorant of the duty of that professor, and could not comprehend what was meant by the science he professed. There had also been three new sheriffs appointed in Scotland, with salaries of between &#x00A3;250 and &#x00A3;300 a year, on a division of counties, where the duties were before executed as in one Shrievalty. These were some of the many acts of the late administration, which would be likely to come under the consideration of the committee. Another appointment, which was equally censurable, was the grant of a pension, during pleasure, of &#x00A3;400 a year, to a civil and criminal Judge in Scotland. (loud cries of hear, hear!). This grant had, no doubt, not been carried into effect, but that was owing to the doubts entertained by the person who was to carry it into effect in Scotland, as to its legality. He should not go through the other exceptionable appointments made by these gentlemen, as he had stated enough to shew, that those who thought exactly with them were not to be exclusively confided in. He should next proceed to read the names of those whom he proposed to be appointed as the committee. It had been usual, that the person who named the committee should always stand the first on the list; but from this he begged to be excused. The noble lord opposite him (lord H.Petty) had done the same; but the house
<col>696</col>
had declared it to have been the usual practice, and on that alone he was induced to continue on it. He hoped, however, there would be no irregularity in his requesting to be left out of it. The following were the gentlemen he proposed;&#x2014;On the former committee&#x2014;Mr. Bankes, Mr. Biddulph, lord H. Petty, Mr. Grattan, lord A. Hamilton, Mr. H. Thornton, Mr. W. Cavendish, Mr. N. Calvert, Mr. Alderman Combe, Mr. Brogden, and Mr. T. Baring.&#x2014;New members&#x2014;Mr. Leycester, Mr. Alderman Shaw, Mr. Hawkins Browne, Mr. Joddrell, Mr. Hiley Addington, Mr. Richard Wharton, Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Sumner, Mr. Milnes, Mr. P. Carew, Mr. Leslie Foster, Mr. Ryder, Mr. Ellison, and Mr. Wigram.&#x2014;These were the persons whom he wished to have appointed on the committee; and he trusted that the house would be sensible of the propriety of the selection he had made. They would observe, that in the list, there were two of the Northern members for Scotland, namely, lord A. Hamilton, and Mr. Rutherford; and two for Ireland, Mr. Grattan and Mr. Foster. Having said thus much, he should first move, "That a Committee be appointed to examine and consider what regulations and checks have been established in order to controul the several branches of the public expenditure in Great Britain and Ireland, and how far the same have been effectual, and what further measures can be adopted for reducing any part of the said expenditure, or diminishing the amount of salaries and emoluments, without detriment to the public service." He should then propose the members individually.&#x2014;On the question being put upon the first motion,</p>
<p>Lord <i>Henry Petty</i> said, that it would be impossible for him not to admire the candour of the right hon. gent. who at the moment of moving for the appointment of a committee of inquiry, had introduced his motion by a gross and partial statement of facts, which the committee was to decide upon. He said the statement was gross and partial, because it was unsupported by any document. He did not impute any unfair intention to the right hon gent. who appeared to him to have spoken from that bias which gentlemen on either side of the house usually felt. If he should fail of refuting the observations of the right hon. gent. it was because he had no notice of the attack, and could not have had the advantage of consulting those documents which would have enabled him to repel it. The conduct of the right hon. 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0363"/>
<col>697</col>
gent. was the more extraordinary, as he had sheltered an hon. baronet, on the preceding night, from the effects of a charge against him, till the document should be produced to justify it; and yet, without any documents to bear him out, that right hon. gent. now called upon the house to receive his various charges against his majesty's late ministers. Unprepared as he must be from his ignorance of the intention or attack of the right hon. gent, he should, so far as his memory served him, endeavour to follow the right hon. gent. through his statement. One of the charges made by the right hon. gent. was, the appointment of a Collector for the Port of Buenos Ayres. Would not every gentleman imagine, from the manner in which this charge had been urged, that a considerable expense was incurred, a heavy burthen accrued in consequence to the public? Was it not common candour, or rather was it not a gross want of candour in the right hon. gent. not to have stated, that no expence was to be incurred on the part of the public, till the duties of the office were to be performed on the recapture of Buenos Ayres? Considerable inconvenience had been felt from the want of an establishment for the collection of the duties in the first instance, and the appointment had been made to guard against a similar inconvenience in case of the re-capture of the settlement. The right hon. gent. had renewed his statement with respect to the appointment of the 300 Surveyors of Taxes, a measure which had originated with the Commissioners of Taxes. As to the nomination of the officers, some might have been so nominated, but since the matter had been mentioned, several persons had stated to him, that they had recommended individuals to these offices, but it had been uniformly answered that no appointment could take place without the sanction of parliament. Another charge was the creation of an office, to which some might object, but which had been given to an individual, who had devoted a long life of disinterested service to the public, and who had in the University but an income of 135<i>l.</i> per annum. It had been thought a better mode to provide for this distinguished and meritorious gentleman, Mr. Dugald Stuart, by giving him that place, which had before been enjoyed by three newspaper writers, than by a pension. Were editors of newspapers the only literary men the gentlemen opposite would protect? was theirs the only science they encouraged? As to the pension to a civil and criminal Judge, he had heard
<col>698</col>
nothing of any such grant. He should not be bold enough to say, that any administration might not fall into abuses, and he had always, since he had a seat in that house, supported motions for inquiries, whether in the shape of naval or military commissions. He was glad to see the right hon. gent. following the example which he had himself, for the first time, given of excluding persons in office from such a committee. As to the gentlemen whom the right hon. gent. left out from the number of the former committee, he should only say, that he saw no good ground for such exclusion. He thought the object of the right hon. gent. would be gained by introducing eight new members in the place of those who were not members of this parliament, and of the hon baronet (sir H. Mildmay) and the hon. gent. opposite (Mr. S. Bourne) now in office. If the parliament was not dissolved to get rid of the committee, why not revive it, as far as that could be done, as it existed before the dissolution? The members who had proceeded with the business in the former committee, would more readily take it up in this, and he should therefore object to any individual who should be proposed to the exclusion of any of the former members who were eligible. The following was the list of the former members in the present parliament: Mr. H. Thornton, Mr. Bankes, lord Mahon, Mr. Biddulph, lord A. Hamilton, Mr. Lamb, Mr. Whitbread, Mr. Baring, Mr. Brogden, Mr. Calvert, Mr. W. Cavendish, Mr. Shaw, Mr. Western, and Mr. Alderman Combe. If these members should be appointed on the committee, he should not then object to the nomination of any other members whom the right hon. gent. might think proper to propose.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Boyle,</i> (Solicitor-General for Scotland), contended, that it was the duty of the committee to investigate the jobs of one administration as well as those of another. It was not only the cases alluded to by the noble lord opposite that challenged inquiry, but others also. The appointment of a collector for Buenos Ayres, among others, called most loudly for investigation. It was true, the appointment would not take place, unless the settlement should be reduced by his majesty's arms; but the nomination constituted a new species of reversion contingent on an event which might or might not happen. The appointment of Gazette writer of Scotland, an office quite new, and the purest of all possible sinecures, was also a proper object of inquiry. He allowed the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0364"/>
<col>699</col>
high merit of the individual who was appointed to this office, but that merit ought to be rewarded by a less exceptionable provision. The printers of the Edinburgh newspapers had been allowed to publish what was called a Gazette, when a change was introduced in the Bankrupt Laws of Scotland, in 1793, on the express condition stipulated by an illustrious individual now no more (Mr. Pitt), that it should cost the country nothing. Now it was taken out of the hands of those newspaper printers, to whom it had afforded a profit of &#x00A3;200 a year, and with a salary of &#x00A3;300 annexed, it was transferred to Mr. Dugald Stuart, his heirs and assignees. This was surely a grant which in every shape called for investigation. It was a sinecure and a reversionary grant united.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Biddulph</i> said, that though he had introduced the measure of the Committee of Inquiry, he had not been allowed to chuse the members. Yet he was anxious to impress upon the house the propriety of adhering, as much as possible, to the names of which it was originally composed. He had attended the committee constantly, except on a few days, on which he had been prevented by ill health, and he could say, that the candour, the good understanding, and the inquiring spirit that had been manifested in it, had never been surpassed. It was impossible to state any political grievance to which it did not attend. The act which it had brought forward, was the application to the house upon which the bill for restraining the grants of places in reversion was founded. The time required for the investigation necessary to prepare well founded and useful reports, had prevented those reports from being made as early as they might otherwise have been. As to the persons who were to be introduced to fill the vacancies created by the changes in the representation, he saw no great exception to the persons proposed. At the same time, he should take occasion, when the names should come to be considered, to propose the name of one person, whom he should, at present, designate no further than by saying, that he appeared to have the keenest sense of the public wrongs, and the strongest disposition to investigate and to reform the wasteful expenditure of the public money.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Brand</i> wished for a fair and honourable inquiry, such as was due to the character of the house, such as was expected by anxious country and a suffering people. He was partial to the right hon. gentlemen on the bench below him (the late ministers), from a high opinion of their talents and in-
<col>700</col>
tegrity. But if any charge should be made on them, he would be the first to call for inquiry and investigation into the grounds of that charge. But when he looked to the bench opposite (the Treasury Bench), and saw on it men certainly all remarkable for their talents, but of whom no two were without pensions, sinecures, and reversions, settled on themselves, or on their families, inquiry was loudly called for, to shew how they and their infants had become possessed of those drains from the public purse. He was shocked at the mode of meeting one accusation by retorting another. When those most remarkable for ability in investigation were excluded, when the names of the new committee were more numerous than those of the old, when the present ministers, not satisfied with introducing eight names instead of those of the old members not returned, he was sure the country would not think the present committee auspicious to the cause of retrenchment and reform. To baffle a people loaded with burthens by holding out a delusive investigation, could lead to nothing but disappointment and discontent. He lamented the insinuation, that no set of men could be found in the house free from party devotions, or from party animosity, an insinuation that must sink the character of the house in the opinion of the country, and must diminish the hopes entertained from the investigation.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Secretary Canning</i> had no doubt that the hon. gentlemen opposite wished for a fair inquiry, and perhaps they thought the appointment of the former members the best means of securing such an inquiry. In answer to them, and particularly to the hon. gent. (Mr. Biddulph), who was entitled to particular consideration in every thing connected with this subject, he had to say, that if human affairs could be conducted without partiality or prejudice, the plan they recommended would be entitled to preference. But as the contrary was the fact, and as personal and party attachments were known to be almost universally prevalent in that house, he saw no danger in avowing to the public what was already well known, the prevalence of those party attachments, and to guard against any unfair preponderance of those attachments, by balancing the numbers of the parties. It was therefore desirable to avoid appointing those whose party prejudices ran all in the same course. He would, indeed, be ready to allow, that if there was one set of men free from all party prejudice and animosity, that if those men had been for many years out of office, and if
<image src="S1V0009P0I0365"/>

on coming at length into office, they exercised their power, neither to stigmatize their opponents, nor immediately to reward their adherents, he would allow that it would be very fit to encourage so brilliant an example of purity, by appointing these men to be of the committee. If not perfectly pure, they would at least be perfectly unaccused, while the conduct of the inquiry would be in their own hands. If, however, he were called upon to point out the description of men most free from political animosity, it was not to the opposite bench that he would look. If he was called upon to point out those who had abstained most from the use of power for the advantage of their dependents, he would look there as little for the reality of the fanciful perfection which was so much to be wished for. If, on the contrary, he were to look for those who made the best use of a very short interval of power for the benefit of themselves and their adherents, the hon gentlemen were those on whom he should fix. A noble lord (H. Petty) had, upon a former occasion, told a story of an old Roman Moralist, who wished to live in a house of glass, that all his actions might be seen. The noble lord had expressed a wish to live in such a house himself. He could not avoid, however, repeating to him the vulgar proverb, "Those who have a house of glass, ought not to begin by throwing stones" [a laugh]. Those by whom this principle of parliamentary practice had been not long since laid down, were now unwilling that the house of glass, which this inquiry was to constitute, should be enlarged by a bow window, so as to include them (a laugh). It was impossible to state grounds for inquiry, otherwise than generally in detail. When his right hon. friend made general charges, he was called as loudly to particularise, and when he did particularise, those who forced him to do so cried shame. Well, indeed, might the specification be objected to by the noble lord opposite, and his colleagues. The noble lord and his colleagues had found out, that a collector, comptroller, searchers, and tide waiters, were wanted at Buenos Ayres, a place not yet in our possession. Common reversions were at least exempt from the fault of bringing immediate charges on the country. But this appointment conveyed so many reversions, which would become immediately chargeable, unless, indeed, the place should not be taken, and the mischief would fall entirely on the unfortunate collector, comptroller, searchers and tide waiters. But it was not only in the burthen that this ap-
<col>702</col>
pointment was mischievous, but in the influence which it created. If it had been in the contemplation of a government that covered sea and land with its glories, and was to extend its power over the world, to apply this system to all its conquests, not only to those actually atchieved, but to those they meant to accumulate one upon another, opening a scene which would have made Buonapart&#x00E9; little in comparison&#x2014;we should have had collectors and comptrollers of the Bosphorus, and searchers and waiters of Rosetta (a laugh). There was here to be observed, a great change in the tone of the hon. gentlemen on the subject of Buenos Ayres. When the conquest of that place was effected, the hon. gentlemen thought it not worthy of being mentioned in the king's speech. Now it had acquired a vast importance in their eyes; and why? not from its importance to the commerce, or navigation, or to the general resources of the country, but because it was a place that afforded room for the appointment of collectors, comptrollers, searchers, and tide waiters. This was a complete key to the whole policy of the late ministers&#x2014;and a most happy illustration it was of their large, liberal, and enlightened views! However far the range might have extended in contemplation, the actual list ended here, and it became necessary to return home to the 300 surveyors of taxes. The noble lord's defence here, as in the former instance, was, that the appointment was prospective. But was the influence prospective? Why did the appointment take place on the eve of a general election? If the coincidence was accidental, the hon. gentlemen were certainly the first favourites of fortune! He acknowledged the high literary merit of Mr. Dugald Stuart, who had besides the merit, and he thought it no light one, of having educated the noble lord. He acknowledged and lamented the general insufficiency of the rewards bestowed on literary merit in this country; but he highly condemned the mode of reward here adopted, by constituting a new sinecure, and bestowing it on Mr. Stuart and his assignees for 21 years. As to the comparison instituted by the noble lord between this grant and the rewards granted to the writers of the Anti-jacobin, he for one, felt no shame for the character or principles of that work; nor any other sorrow for the share he had in it than that which the imperfection of his pieces was calculated to inspire. He was told that this provision of Mr. Stuart was substituted for a professorship of medical jurisprudence, which it had been intended to institute. He should like
<image src="S1V0009P0I0366"/>
<col>703</col>
to see the hon. gentlemen in the full swing of their insolence of power, making this appointment, immediately after their unqualified attacks upon their antagonists, as much as to say, "Though you can do nothing, we dare do every thing." He doubted whether this same science of medical jurisprudence could be found any where mentioned, even in the Scotch Encyclop&#x00E6;dia. In answer to what the noble lord had said about newspapers, he would ask, was there no instance here of a newspaper (the Morning Chronicle) conspicuous for its attachment to the constitution, and for the fairness of its mode of detailing all transactions in which its party interests had a place, whose proprietor was appointed Secretary to the Barrack Board, at which a secretary was a new and a sinecure institution? With such an instance in their own conduct, how could they tax the present ministers with partiality to newspapers? There was another act which he looked upon as a flagrant breach of the constitution, the grant of a pension of 400l. a-year during pleasure to a Scotch Judge, [lord H. Petty said, across the table, he knew nothing about this matter]. The hon. gentlemen, when in power, were so united, that no difference of opinion prevailed among them; when out, and charged with a job, they fled in all directions, and left it to light on what head it would.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Curwen</i> rejoiced to see the right hon. gent. throw the first stone from the glasshouse. Though he was partial to his hon. friends below him, he was not one of those who would defend any man through thick or thin. He was sorry there were those who acted on the contrary system. There was a vote of the house, declaring the propriety of abolishing sinecure places. He was glad to hear the hon. gentlemen opposite so strenuous in condemning the creation of such places. It was a pledge that no such thing would be done in the administration of the hon. gentlemen. It was however reported, that all the right hon. gentlemen opposite held sinecure places for themselves or their families. If such a system was conquered, though our allies might have lost a battle, we should have acquired a great victory, when the money that was wrung from the people could no longer be absorbed in this manner. The right hon secretary had said, there was no independent man in parliament: he was at least thus far independent, that he had never accepted a favour from any minister, nor ever would. He would ask the right hon. secretary, whether or not he himself had a pension?</p>
<col>704</col>
<p>Mr. Secretary <i>Canning</i> denied having said there were no independent men in the house. He had asserted only that party attachments were prevalent. As to the hon. gent's. question, the answer was, that on his retiring from the office of under secretary for foreign affairs, Mr. Pitt and lord Grenville proposed to make a provision for him, which he had accepted, and settled by his desire one half on himself, and the other half on two very near and dear relations, who were dependent for their subsistence upon his labours.</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Laurence</i> thought it was extraordinary, that on the very day when we had received from the continent news most disastrous to our allies, the secretary of state for foreign affairs, should, in the course of his speech, amuse the house so much with idle fancies, with jokes and epigrammatic points. As to his argument, it did not bear at all upon the question. The question was for the appointment of a committee, to consider and report what retrenchments might be made in the public expenditure, and what useless places might be abolished. Now, there was no one instance mentioned, either by the chancellor of the exchequer or the right hon. secretary, which could be referred to that committee. As to the appointment of a Collector or Comptroller of Buenos Ayres, there was no burden now upon the country on that account, and if the place should be taken, it was evident that there must be such officers. The question, then, between the late and present administration on this point was merely who should have the influence that was to be obtained by the appointments? Next, as to the place given to Mr. Dugald Stuart, the right hon. gent. did not object to the burden but only to the mode, and thought it would be better to provide for him by a pension than a place. On this point, therefore, there was no retrenchment proposed. With respect to the 300 Surveyors of Taxes also, the right hon. secretary confessed that the appointment of them was right, and that the present ministers meant to pursue the same measure, but that they intended to appoint the surveyors themselves. In all those instances which the chancellor of the exchequer had mentioned, there was not one in which they proposed the least retrenchment of expence, or any matter which could be referred to the committee. They only seemed angry at having their own patronage and influence somewhat intrenched upon by the appointments of their predecessors.</p>
<p>Sir <i>S. Romilly</i> lamented that the simple question before the house had been so
<image src="S1V0009P0I0367"/>
<col>705</col>
much wandered from. Much was expected from the inquiry which it was now proposed to institute. The character of the house would depend upon the issue of that inquiry; and the confidence in it would depend on the description of men of whom it would be composed. When it was sought to replace in its proper situation every thing else that had been disturbed by the dissolution, this most important matter ought not to be deranged. Though other gentlemen might be as well qualified in other respects, the knowledge already acquired by those who composed the last committee rendered them by far the fittest persons to be re-chosen now. If they were not appointed, the pledge given in his majesty's speech would not be kept.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Bankes</i> said, that it was with the utmost pain he had heard the accusations and recriminations which had been brought forward this night. He thought the effect of them must be to degrade the character of all public men in the eyes of the public at large. He could not avoid expressing his strongest disapprobation of some of the acts which had been stated to have been done by the late administration. As to the granting a pension, during pleasure, to a civil and criminal Judge in Scotland, he thought it a measure so unconstitutional, and in every point of view so reprehensible, that it must be seriously investigated before the committee. As the Finance Committee was a committee of inquiry only, and had not the power of acting upon whatever might be the result of their investigation, he did expect that not a single member of the late committee would have been excluded on the re-appointment of it. What danger, he would ask, was there to be apprehended from the same persons that had already shewn themselves to be both able and industrious in the pursuit of these inquiries, continuing to inquire, and to report the evidence which they received, together with their opinion thereon, to the house, when the house would afterwards have the power of judging for itself upon the evidence, and of agreeing or disagreeing with their committee as to their discretion might seem fit, and of acting only according to the judgment of the house? There was one point, in fact, upon which the late committee had not entirely made up their minds; it was but justice, therefore, that an opportunity should be given them that they might be enabled to come at that final determination. The particular point to which he alluded was that of
<col>706</col>
a discovery which was made by the committee of some abuse in the office of the Paymaster-General. At the time when that discovery was made, no apprehension was entertained of the sudden dissolution of parliament which afterwards took place. Under the impression that they were likely to sit much longer, they came to a resolution not to deliver in their report, as to the facts on which their discovery rested, until they should have hit upon the means that would be most likely to prevent a recurrence of similar abuses in future. Upon that point they had not come to any determination; but for his own part, he believed that the only radical cure for such an evil was the speedy passing of Accounts. But, as the committee had not come to any determination on that head, that was one reason why he wished that the same persons should be again appointed to an office which they had already most honourably filled. But, exclusive of this consideration, there was another, namely, that the zeal, ability, industry and integrity which he had already witnessed in the former members, had such weight upon his mind, that he in fact regretted that any one of their names should be omitted on the present occasion; but he was most peculiarly sorry, he must say, at seeing the name of an hon. friend of his (Mr. Sharpe) omitted, as he had been one of the most active, the most eminently useful servant to the public in the former committee&#x2014;a gentleman to whose acuteness and industry, the house and the public were principally indebted for the discoveries which were made in the first report. But as a plain matter of fact, he was confident it must be obvious to every fair, candid and impartial man, that those who had already given up a good deal of their time and bent their mind to inquiries of the nature which was spoken of, must be infinitely better qualified to enter on such inquiries in the present parliament, than any other gentleman whatever who had not heretofore turned his attention that way.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Whitbread</i> said, that from an expectation that the committee would have much longer time to continue their investigations than he found was afterwards permitted them, and knowing as he did, that owing to his mind being otherwise engaged at the commencement of their sitting he was unable to attend at the first of their investigations; he therefore did not think fit to attend the committee during the latter part of their sitting, but waited until they should have made a report, intending then to join
<image src="S1V0009P0I0368"/>
<col>707</col>
them on their entering upon a fresh subject of inquiry. For this reason he agreed with the hon. member who spoke last, and on the ground which had been by him stated, he could not complain that his name was omitted in the list of members to form the present committee.</p>
<p>Mr <i>Addington</i> thought that it was necessary his vote on a former evening should not lead to any misconstruction. He did not vote for the address, and oppose the amendment, because he considered the dissolution of parliament a laudable measure, but because this recurrence to the sense of the people was to be justified on constitutional grounds. He was fully aware that it must be attended with great and serious inconveniences, and therefore he was most anxious that matters should be restored as nearly as possible to the state in which they were prier to that appeal, or to the condition in which they would have been, had there been no dissolution of parliament. Such were the views with which he conceived the chancellor of the exchequer brought in the bill last night, and he hoped his expectations would not be disappointed. With regard to the names, he had only, one objection to make, and it respected a person, of whose abilities or deficiencies he was the most competent to judge. He hoped the house would exclude himself, as he felt that he was not adequate to discharge the important duty. He entertained always a high opinion of his right hon. friend, the chancellor of the exchequer, and he earnestly hoped caution would be observed, in the present arrangement, in order to avoid those suspicions that any partiality must unavoidably produce.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Cochrane</i> declared, that he did expect that the same regulation would have been adopted on this occasion, as that which had been agreed to with respect to Private Bills. Besides this, from their actions he judged that the last committee was better than any new one that was likely to be appointed.</p>
<p>Colonel <i>Shipley</i> declared that the former committee had the entire confidence of the country, when what he felt himself entitled to call the unjustifiable conduct of ministers, the dissolution, deprived the country of the further benefit of their labours. For this reason he thought that ministers owed it to the individuals who composed that committee, to the house, and to the country, to re-animate, now they had an opportunity of doing so, that virtuous body whose vital powers the pestilential breath of ministers had for a time suspended.</p>
<col>708</col>
<p>Mr. <i>Stuart Wortley</i> asked an hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Bankes), whether the report was regularly drawn up before him, or with his approbation as chairman of the committee, and ready to be delivered at the bar of the house when the dissolution took place?</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Bankes</i> answered, that that was the only day on which he was absent from the committee. He understood, however, that the report was drawn up, approved of by the committee, and ready to be presented at the bar of the house. As he had already stated, the committee had come to the resolution of relating the facts, and pointing out the remedy at the same time, but such a resolution was very fairly alterable according as circumstances might suggest to the committee; of such circumstances the dissolution was certainly one.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Huskisson</i> observed, that the committee had adjourned to two o'clock on Monday; consequently they had not time to have prepared such a report as that which was spoken of, before the dissolution took place.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>H. Thornton</i> declared that he was of opinion that the statement of facts and the remedy proposed for those evils ought to be given together; the committee was of the same opinion; but the resolution of the committee, he thought was repealable, as circumstances might appear to them to justify it; and for his own part he was of opinion that it would be much better that a naked report of such facts as had came to their knowledge should be given to parliament, than that the report should be entirely lost, and the committee deprived of the power of stating what they knew, by the dissolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman <i>Combe</i> assured the house that in consequence of the absence of their chairman, another gentleman was called to the chair. The report was distinctly read, and he never saw or heard any act of any committee of that house meet with more unanimous approbation, than the report which was now mentioned.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Sharpe</i> acknowledged, that he felt the full force of the two compliments which had been paid him. To his hon, friend (Mr. Bankes) he was extremely thankful for the very handsome manner in which he had mentioned his name. To the gentlemen on the other side, he had also reason to express his acknowledgment of the kindness which they had done him; for he considered it to he as high a compliment as those gentlemen could bestow, when they thought proper to express their objection to him by the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0369"/>
<col>709</col>
omission of his name in the new list. There was one fact, however, with which he thought it right that he should acquaint the house, that was, that if he should not be again chosen a member of the Finance Committee, and should those that were to be the chosen people of the new ministry, attempt to suppress any statement of evidence that had been already entered on, it was some consolation to him to have it to say, that he had in his own hands a number of extracts and minutes from the intended report, which he pledged himself to bring forward whenever he should see any necessity for doing so. But in point of fact, he had much rather that he should not be again appointed to serve in the Finance Committee, as he would now stand in a very different situation from that in which he formerly acted.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Lamb</i> declared that he took on himself his full share of the responsibility which was attached to the framing of the report.</p>
<p>Lord <i>A. Hamilton</i> added his testimony to that of his hon. friend as to the necessity which there was for the formation of the report, and took also upon himself his full share of the responsibility which was attached to it.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Howick</i> said, there were some points in the debate upon which he could not forbear to offer a few observations. Before, however, he proceeded to these points, he begged leave to say, that there seemed to be some misunderstanding among the gentlemen on the other side, with regard to the Report, which was ready to be presented on the day of the prorogation. If gentlemen were but recovered from their warmth upon this subject, he thought it might be easily proved that the conduct of the committee alluded to was strictly correct and impartial; that they had done no more than their duty, nay more, that they would have violated their duty, if they had not acted as they had done. The hon. gent. who acted as chairman of that committee, had resolved not to report until a statement of the evils they discovered should be accompanied by a description of the remedy to be recommended. But that resolution was revocable, and the hon. gent. admitted that the committee had completed their inquiries. They had materials to report upon, and in fact, if he was rightly informed, the committee were in daily expectation of the hon. gent. coming down as chairman, with a report prepared for their consideration. But the report of a sudden dissolution being communicated to the hon. gent., that hon. gent.,
<col>710</col>
and he did not mention it for any purpose of blame, thought proper to leave town in order to secure another object, where he had reason to expect a contested election. The other members remained in town; and hearing the prospect of a speedy dissolution, he would put it to the house and the country, whether they were not bound to take care that the fruit of their laborious investigations should not be lost? With a view to guard against that, and with the prospect before them, the committee were, he contended, perfectly right in proceeding as they had done, although, owing to a little dexterity, the attainment of their object was prevented for the moment. That, however, this committee had, on the whole, acted a most meritorious part; that they had been active and diligent in their inquiries, and that in the conclusion of their labours they had done what their duty required, he would be ever ready to maintain. But this committee was not to be revived as it stood before, because, as the secretary for foreign affairs had stated, it was necessary to introduce into it a different set of men, of a different party in politics, which change that rt hon. gent. declared to be necessary with a view to impartiality. For according to that right hon. secretary's declamatory strain of observations there was no chance of obtaining impartiality, but through what he called a collision of opposite opinions, and that too in a committee of inquiry. Now, for himself, he would say, that he was now, and had always been, a party man, and for these reasons; first, because he thought a party connection was the most effectual way to promote any public object; and secondly, because, to say the least of it, he could not think from what he had seen in that house, or heard out of it, that men who disclaimed party, were the most remarkable for independence and purity. But, much as he preferred a party connection, and was convinced of its beneficial operations for the public, still he would deprecate the idea of it if he thought the attachments it engendered were likely to stifle inquiry, or to conceal the public malversation of a party man. Sure he was that among that party with which he had the honour to act, there existed no such disposition; and yet, unless the gentlemen on the other side entertained such a suspicion, he could not conceive a reason for the manner in which they prepared to new model this committee. Among the names of those members of the former committee whom the chancellor of the exchequer thought proper
<image src="S1V0009P0I0370"/>
<col>711</col>
to exclude, he desired to have one pointed out to whom any suspicion could reasonably attach, of being influenced by party attachments in the examination of public delinquency. He would take, for instance, without any disposition to particular preference, his hon. friend near him (Mr. Whitbread). Would the gentlemen on the other side object to his independence, after the swelling compliments which the house had heard some time since applied to his hon. friend's manly independence by the secretary for foreign affairs? He meant upon the discussion of the conduct of the negociation. He would ask of these gentlemen, whether they could suspect that his hon. friend would, if appointed to this committee, attempt to screen even him, were he guilty, from the consequences of any malversation? Upon what ground, then, was the name of his hon. friend excluded? And he might put the same question as to any of the other gentlemen on his side of the house, whose names were omitted; but it was the resolution of the gentlemen on the treasury bench, for the purpose of a fair collision of parties even in this committee, to construct it of an even balance of opposite parties. The house, however, would judge of this proposed fairness when it was understood, that out of the 25 members no less than 14 were selected from among the connections of the minister.&#x2014;With regard to the charges and insinuations thrown out against the conduct of the last administration, he should, in the first place, answer their accusers by saying, that he only desired inquiry. All he should ask of the house and the country would be, not to adopt any opinion; not to come to any conclusion; not to pronounce any judgment upon the accusations loosely thrown out by the gentlemen on the other side, particularly without any notice to himself or his friends, without affording them any fair opportunity of answering them. Upon every such charge he desired only inquiry, and that such inquiry might be made in the most hostile form. If the gentlemen on the treasury bench thought they could substantiate any charges against the last administration, let them do it. But let the old administration go on with its investigation, and his wish was, that a new committee should be formed to inquire into the conduct of the last administration, composed altogether of members from the ministerial side of the house (a loud cry of hear! hear!), excepting only such as held offices.&#x2014;The noble lord next proceeded to animadvert upon the particular
<col>712</col>
charges brought forward by the chancellor of the exchequer. First, as to the appointment of a collector to Buenos Ayres, with which was connected some question as to the sincerity of the late ministers. Upon the subject of reversions, he would appeal to the hon. gent. (Mr Bankes), whether he did not express to that gent. his anxious wish in favour of an act to prevent the further grant of reversions, and that long before the last committee was appointed? Indeed, the sincerity of the late ministers was proved by their conduct, for they did not grant a single reversion, and it was notorious, that, among others, a very valuable reversion fell in during their administration. But to return to Buenos Ayres; the appointment could only be objected to on one of three grounds; either that the office was quite unnecessary, that the person appointed was exceptionable, or that the late ministers by such an appointment, improperly interfered with the patronage of their successors. As to the first, no one could deny that a collector would be necessary at such a place as Buenos Ayres, if we had it in our possession, and if we had it not no expence would arise out of the appointment; as to the second, sure he was, that no objection was likely to be made to the person who was appointed upon his recommendation, namely, Mr. Wilberforce Bird; and as to the third, no interference with the patronage of the present ministers could be alleged, because the appointment was revocable at pleasure.&#x2014;After commenting on this and the other accusations advanced by the chancellor of the exchequer, the noble lord begged to observe, that for the most part he never heard of the cases to which they referred, until they were mentioned by the right hon. gent. in that house. This was particularly the case with regard to the 300 surveyors, for he had no connection with that department; but how, he would ask, did that case stand upon the right hon. gent.'s own shewing? Why, the appointment of these officers was recommended by the tax office, some short time after the late ministers came into office. Proper persons were immediately appointed to ascertain the number of officers that would be necessary to carry into effect the object proposed by the tax-office. It got abroad, that such appointments were intended, and applications were made to the treasury, and some of these applications succeeded. Promises were made, and such promises formed what the chancellor of the exchequer called the nomination, which he objected to. But these
<image src="S1V0009P0I0371"/>
<col>713</col>
nominations required an act of parliament to render them of any avail, and, strange to tell, unfortunately for the right hon. gent.'s argument, no such act was ever proposed. Thus, an administration so very greedy of patronage, so very anxious to provide for its friends, was so negligent as to go out of power without taking care to dispose of those good things!&#x2014;The third point to which the chancellor of the exchequer directed his accusations, referred to the appointment of what he called a new office in Scotland. But what was the fact? Why, that his majesty having determined to settle a pension of &#x00A3;300 a year upon Mr. Dugald Stuart, as a reward for his services, the late ministers rendered an office, already existing in Scotland, available, as far as it would go, to discharge a part of that pension, and thus produced a saving to the public. Such was the plain state of the case. Now, as to another charge, of which he declared, on his honour, he never heard a word until stated by the right hon. gent. this night, namely, as to the intention to grant a pension, during pleasure, to one of the Scotch Judges&#x2014;["Intention," observed a voice across the table, "the warrant was actually made out."] The noble lord repeated, that he was quite ignorant of the transaction; but it appeared that the thing was not completed. However, he was ready to say, that jealous as he was, and ever would be, of the independence of the judges, he could not approve of such a grant as that described. But he confessed that he had doubts of the fact; and he begged the house to suspend its judgment till inquiry should be made respecting it. This suspension of judgment, which justice warranted him in demanding, was all that he requested of the house and the country.</p>
<p>The <i>Chancellor of the Exchequer</i> replied to the observations of the speakers on the other side. The accusations of partiality in the nomination of the proposed committee he retorted upon the gentlemen on the other side, by stating, that in the names he proposed there were a considerable proportion of their friends, while it was to be recollected that in the former committee there were only two gentlemen who were understood to have any attachment to the party with which he had the honour to act. The right hon. gent. ridiculed the rumour so industriously circulated, that the dissolution was occasioned by a desire of ministers to prevent a certain transaction from being reported by the
<col>714</col>
former committee; which transaction was in fact notorious, and all the evidence with regard to which was to be referred to the new committee (we understood the right hon. gent. to allude to the affair respecting Mr. Steele, see Appendix to the present volume.) Adverting again to the appointment to Buenos Ayres, the right hon. gent. mentioned, that which he wished to contrast with the conduct of the noble lord and his colleagues, and as a proof that the present ministers were not so anxious about influence; namely, that Mr. Wilberforce Bird having applied to them for the office of collector of Monte Video, conceiving it to be included in his appointment to Buenos Ayres, they denying expressly the validity of his appointment, but still unwilling to disappoint the expectations of any man, did appoint Mr. Bird to the collectorship of Monte Video.&#x2014;The first motion, that a committee should be appointed, &amp;c. was then unanimously agreed to. Upon that for confining the number of the committee to twenty-five,</p>
<p>Lord <i>Howick</i> rose, and adverting to the suggestion made by an hon. gent. (Mr. Biddulph), relative to the propriety of the appointment of sir Francis Burdett as one of the members of this committee; took occasion to observe that, although he could assure the house there was no gentleman on the other side more adverse to the general conduct of that person than he was, although no man was more the subject of that person's attack, and that of the party, if such they could be called, who acted with him, still he would advise the adoption of the hon. gent.'s suggestion. It would be recollected by any person acquainted with the history of the times, that notwithstanding the attempts always made, said the noble lord, to connect us with this person's party, there was no party in the country more obnoxious to them than that with which I have the honour to act. This gentleman, it will be observed, stands forward as the enemy of public abuses, and I would recommend ministers to keep a vacancy open for him in this committee. There he will have an opportunity of inquiring into the abuses of which he complains, and proposing the remedy in a much more proper way than he has heretofore done, or attempted to do. I should therefore wish to have him afforded the opportunity, although I happen to be so obnoxious to his attacks, probably not so much from the impulse of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0372"/>
<col>715</col>
his own mind, as in consequence of the incitement of others.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Biddulph</i> observed, that he was actuated wholly by public motives in proposing the hon. baronet's name, and that he acted without any connection whatever with the hon. baronet. But having perceived that the hon. baronet had a quick sense of public wrongs, and was anxious to remove them, he thought him a very fit person to be appointed a member, and to promote the objects of this committee.&#x2014;A member under the gallery, whose name we could not learn, announced his intention of opposing the appointment of sir F. Burdett, as an ineligible person, upon the ground that he had not yet taken his seat, and also upon other grounds.</p>
<p>Lord <i>Howick</i> proposed the division to take place upon the proposition of a name from himself.</p>
<p>The <i>Chancellor of the Exchequer</i> said, he should put to the house the names he had already mentioned, and it would be competent to the noble lord, or any member, to propose such other name as they might think proper, in lieu of any that he proposed.&#x2014;The names of Mr. Bankes and Mr. Biddulph were unanimously agreed to. Upon the name of Mr. Leycester being proposed,</p>
<p>Lord <i>Howick</i> rose to propose the name of Mr. Sharpe in lieu of it, observing, that he should not wish it to be understood generally, that the division was to take place upon the propriety of nominating Mr. Sharpe. At the same time he had objections to Mr. Leycester, which the noble lord was proceeding to state, when</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Home Sumner</i>, who said, that he thought it improper that strangers should be present at a discussion of the merits of individual members, moved that the gallery should be cleared. Strangers were accordingly excluded during the remainder of the debate. On the division for the nomination of Mr. Leycester, the numbers were, for the proposition 244; against it 149; majority 95.&#x2014;After this division, we understood that the name of sir Francis Burdett was proposed by Mr. Biddulph. Upon this proposition a debate arose, which continued above an hour, and terminated in the rejection of the hon. baronet's name without a division.&#x2014;The Committee was then appointed, consisting of the members proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Adjourned at three o'clock.</p>

<p><member>[PAPERS RELATING TO THE POLYGARS.]&#x2014;Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>rose to give notice, that he would on Friday se'nnight move for the production of certain papers, relative to the Polygars. Being on his legs, he took occasion to advert to another subject, which was intimately connected with that to which his notice referred, namely, the subject of the Carnatic. Upon that subject he had, in the last session of the last parliament, moved for the printing of certain papers which were not ready before the dissolution, but which had since been distributed among most of the members, and of course they had full opportunity of becoming acquainted with it. For himself he could say, that he was quite prepared to enter into the discussion, but as a matter of courtesy he thought a noble lord (Folkestone) claimed the precedency, and as that noble lord's motion required some preparation, he could not look for a full attendance upon the question with which he meant to follow. He, therefore, could not feel himself able to promise the introduction of the Carnatic Question, in the course of the present session. However, if those who were immediately concerned for the noble marquis to whom these investigations referred, wished to have this question brought before the house, he could tell them that he was fully prepared to bring it forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>professed his anxiety to have this matter at once brought forward and decided. He begged the house to consider the time in which the friends of the noble lord alluded to had been kept in suspense. For no less than six years this question had been under the consideration of the house, and according to the manner in which those who undertook to manage it proceeded, it might be still six years more before they arrived at a final issue, during which the noble marquis and his friends were to be agitated by perpetual discussions, or rather by perpetual abuse. With such a consideration in their minds, it was of course the wish of all connected with the noble marquis, that the business might be determined as soon as possible. If, therefore, the hon. baronet was willing to prosecute the business, it was the wish of the noble marquis's friends that he should bring it forward at once.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>had no reason for hesitating
<image src="S1V0009P0I0373"/>
<col>717</col>
with regard to himself, for he was as much prepared at present as he required to be. But there was a precedency due to the noble lord already alluded to, which he could not discard. He begged, however, to have it understood, that he had no Wish for procrastination. The word <i>if,</i> used by the right hon. baronet, was by no means attributable to any part of his conduct in this transaction, for he had always shewn himself willing to proceed in the business, and no part of the delay that had occurred was attributable to him.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-07-02">Thursday, July 2.</date>
<p><member>[CLOATHING OF VETERAN BATTALIONS.]&#x2014;Mr. Rose</member>, <membercontribution>agreeably to notice, made his promised motion for the production of certain letters which had passed on the subject of the Cloathing for the Veteran Battalions, and which had not been produced in compliance with a former order of the house. He thought it necessary to explain what the nature of the letters and minutes, which in his opinion were material to the subject in question, and which he presumed to think had been improperly withheld, actually was. When he was appointed one of the joint paymasters of the forces, it occurred to him, that if any savings were likely to be made in the military department, the cloathing was a branch in which it might as probably be effected as in any other. He inquired accordingly, how other parts of the service were provided in this respect, and found that a person who contracted for cloathing the marines, did so at a rate greatly lower than that charged for cloathing the invalids. He sent for this person and found that his charge was only 1l. 1s. 6d per suit, whereas the charge then made for cloathing the invalids, was 1l. 7s. 9d. It turned out, however, that there was more lace on the cloaths of the Veteran Battalions than the contractor had been aware, he therefore increased his estimate to 1l. 3s. Having ascertained this, the right hon. gent. next sent for the person accustomed to cloath the Veteran Battalions, telling him that his wish was not to change any tradesmen, if they could continue to serve the public on nearly the same terms with others. He stewed to this gentleman (Mr. Dickie) the suit of cloaths, furnished by the person to whom he (Mr. R.) had applied, whose name was Courtney, and asked if he (Mr. D.) was willing to serve government agreeably to that pattern, for 1l. 3s.? Mr. Dickie replied he could not, and that if
<col>718</col>
he (Mr. R.) could get any person to contract with him on such terms, it would be wrong in him not to close with the offer. After the pattern suits had been approved of, Mr. Rose did give Mr. Courtnay the orders, and some of the battalions were served by him. When he wished, however, to deliver to the noble lord (Temple) 2000 suits which had been prepared, they were refused to be accepted of, on the ground that they were of bad quality, of bad workmanship, and too scanty. In the mean time the noble lord again applied to a Mr. Box, who was a partner of Mr. Dickie, and received an estimate from him, not indeed as he had formerly charged, amounting to 1l. 7s. 9d. but to 1l. 4s. 9d, being, however, 1s. 9d. Per suit more than those furnished by Mr. Courtnay, It appealed from the minutes in the office, that this change had been made in consequence of complaints that the cloathing was of bad quality, bad workmanship, &amp;c. and that letters had accordingly been written to the commanding officers of the different battalions who had been served by Mr. Courtnay, inquiring if the fact was so? The answers to this inquiry had not been produced; and it was of the suppression of them that Mr. Rose complained. He proceeded to read these letters, as they were to be found in the office, and stated, that so far from supporting the truth of the complaints made against the quality of the cloth and workmanship furnished by Mr. Courtnay, they uniformly proved his articles to be better, in these respects, than they had been for several years. The only fault they had, was that they were small, and under the general size; a fault which was immediately remedied. So, therefore, the minute in consequence of which the contract with Mr. Courtnay was set aside, and that with Mr. Box entered into, was unsupported by evidence, and proceeded on a false allegation. This might, in his opinion, become no improper subject of inquiry for the Committee of Finance, or the Commissioners of Military Inquiry. All, however, that he now wished to move for was that the letters from the commanders of the battalions as to the quality of the cloaths furnished should be laid before the house. He concluded by moving for Copies of all Minutes, Letters, &amp;c. relative to the Cloathing of the Veteran Battalions between the years 1804 and 1807.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Temple</member> <membercontribution>said, he should not inquire into the reasons which had induced the rights hon gent. to take on himself the present statement, when, if there was any thing in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0374"/>
<col>719</col>
it, the Committee of Finance or Commissioners of Military Inquiry, were, as he himself stated, the proper persons to inquire into the circumstances of it. At the time the right hon. gent. originally made his motion, he (lord T.) explained to him, that there were a great many of the letters referred to contained in the minutes, it would therefore be unnecessary to produce them, and in this the right hon. gent. seemed at the time to acquiesce. There was at that time other information and other letters on the subject, which, being of a private nature, and not addressed to him in his public capacity, he did not feel himself authorised to produce. He now, however, had certificates of the facts, contained in those letters, and which he thought material. Mr. Box had cloathed the battalions in question for 15 years previous to the time of Mr. Courtnay's having been employed. Shortly after he (lord T.) came into office, complaints were made to him of the badness and smallness of the cloathing. In consequence of these complaints, inquiry was made, and a comparison was also taken of a suit of them with a suit belonging to another corps. They Were found to be badly made up, and from this circumstance, joined to their being of an under size, the contract was given back to the man who had executed it for 15 years. Two things were to be considered in a contract. It might be too dear, or it might be too cheap. The inadequacy of quality and size was in this instance, found to be by no Means counterbalanced by the lowness of the price. There was a difference between the two estimates of 19001. which surely the public could not reckon any object when put in competition with the health, warmth, and comfort of those brave men who had been wounded in their service. His lordship proceeded to read a letter and a certificate from the major of the second battalion, and from the quarter master of the battalion at the Tower, stating that the cloaths furnished by Mr. Courtnay were by no means fit for men wounded in the service, who required large and comfortable cloaths, but might be fit enough for stripplings. They were in general too small, some of them had to be cut down to join out others; 600 could not be fitted out of 1000 suits: some of those furnished by the former clothiers, were required to be issued to supply the deficiency; 200 were obliged to be returned; and when remonstrated with as to the unfitness of the cloathing, the answer by Mr. Courtnay was, that he would be a great loser by the contract.
<col>720</col>
The noble lord referred to his successor, if applications had not been made to him, from more than one battalion, not to change the old clothier.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Long</member> <membercontribution>admitted that applications had been made to him, but the mode was now changed, being by advertisement for estimates. If the noble lord had been at all hurt by the agitating of the present question, he could not help thinking he had himself alone to blame, in carrying away in his pocket such evidence as seemed to support the step which he had taken, and leaving behind him in the office only such evidence as went to condemn him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>complained, that these charges were preferred without giving his noble friend the opportunity of a fair trial, From the information his noble friend had received, he was not only justified in transferring the contract as he had done; but he would have been highly culpable if he had not transferred it. He knew not whether the clothing of the marines was furnished by Mr. Courtnay; but he had heard while at the admiralty very general complaints of the marine clothing.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>thought the statement of this night entirely owing to the noble lord's own conduct. If he was inconvenienced he had himself alone to blame.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>thought that though the, right hon. gent. might be justified in bringing forward the measure, he could not be justified in not now proceeding in it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>approved of the mode in which the business had been brought forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>wished to know if the noble lord meant to say that the substance of the letters were contained in the Minutes, or only that they were referred to in them?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>answered the question by reading a part of the minutes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Tarleton</member> <membercontribution>begged the house to consider its own dignity. If this practice of recrimination was to be perpetually resorted to; if when a charge was to be made against one party, it was answered by a counter complaint, there never would be an end to any debate in that house. He thought the subject ought to go before a committee of inquiry, without further ceremony.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>read extracts of letters from various commanding officers, expressing their satisfaction with the manner in which Mr. Courtnay had executed his contract. The late ministry had written a circular letter,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0375"/>
<col>721</col>
inviting complaints against the clothing, and the uniform answer was in its favour, instead of complaining of it. But they did not wait until these answers were received; the fact being, that the new contract was hastily closed before they had received a single answer to the pompous inquiry they had affected to set on foot, previous to the dismissal of the former contractor.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>said, this was one of the neatest jobs he ever heard of in his life. He was glad the house had taken up the subject of the army clothing, as it would lead to the discovery of a great many abuses in that department, and tend to better the condition of our brave defenders.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SHERIFFS DEPUTE OF SUTHERLAND, &amp;C. AND LORD CULLEN'S PENSION.]&#x2014;Mr. W. Adam rose</member> <membercontribution>to make his promised motion on the above subjects. He entered into a description of the office of Sheriff Depute in Scotland. It was a selection of local jurisdiction of the highest importance, and one in which it was extremely necessary that the duty should be performed with as much dispatch as possible. The Shrievalties of Sutherland and Caithness were formerly united, but, in consequence of the inaccessibility of the former county, it had been deemed necessary to separate them and to appoint a sheriff for each. This occasioned an expense of only 350l. a year. Sutherland was a county containing 26,000 inhabitants, and he appealed to all who knew Scotland, whether the appointment of a separate Sheriff Depute did not stand recommended on public grounds of advantage. He then explained the situation of the counties of Kinross and Clackmannan, neither of which had a Sheriff Depute. The Sheriff Depute of Stirling had jurisdiction in Clackmannan, and the Sheriff Depute of Fife in Kinross. In the latter county, as long as he remembered, the Sheriff Depute never did himself discharge the duty of his office, but appointed a substitute for that purpose, who, though a very respectable man, possessed no legal information. It became necessary to remedy these evils, and on public principles of utility, Sheriffs Depute were appointed for those two counties of Clackmannan and Kinross. To effect this, it became necessary to obtain the formal resignations of the Sheriffs of Fife and Stirling, who were afterwards re-appointed with their salaries.&#x2014;He next proceeded to the subject of the warrant for granting a pension to lord Cullen, and expressed his regret that the sub-
<col>722</col>
ject should come forward in the present shape, more especially, as on that day, or on the next, the barons of the Courts of Exchequer in Scotland would come to a determination upon it. He passed the highest eulogium on his noble friend, and declared, that a more enlightened scholar, a more profound lawyer, a more agreeable companion, and a more perfect gentleman, never existed. He would shortly state the circumstances under Which the warrant was granted, and he was sure, he should satisfy the house that what was proposed to be done, was not more than what ought to be done. In Oct. 1805, he received an intimation from lord Cullen, that having spent a day with the Duke of Portland, at Bulstrode, his grace expressed a wish to Communicate with him (Mr. Adam) on the subject of a pension for lord Cullen for life, with a reversion to his wife. The change of administration, which soon after took place, prevented the completion of this business. In 1806, it was natural for lord Cullen, who had been connected with the late administration, to bring his case again under consideration. He did not contend that in any case, it was fit to grant a pension to a Judge for life, but he contended that the crown should have the power of doing so, and he contended, that in cases in which a Judge was involuntarily involved in embarrassments, it was incumbent on the crown to endeavour to relieve him. Lord Cullen was the eldest son of D. Cullen, one of the greatest men that Scotland ever produced, and who had raised the reputation of the Medical School of Edinburgh, to the height which it then stood. Dr. Cullen, however, died poor, and left a large family; the younger branches of that family were in a great measure provided for by the public; but lord Cullen, the eldest son, could not guard himself from the effect of the embarrassments which descended to him front his father, and was in consequence obliged to give up two-thirds of the revenue of his Situation, to relieve himself in some degree from those embarrassments. Those circumstances were taken into consideration by the late ministers, and there was every reason to suppose that in August last the affair was completed. However owing to the official delays, the warrant for granting a pension of 400l. a year to lord Cullen for life, with a provision of 200l. a year to Mrs. Cullen, was one of the last acts of the late administration. From that period until Monday last he had heard nothing more about it. He had no idea that the warrant
<image src="S1V0009P0I0376"/>
<col>723</col>
was for any thing else but a provision for life; he was sure lord Grenville Meant it to be for life. If when the grant was produced it should appear on the face of it, that it was during pleasure, he would contend that it was an error; the very circumstance of the reversion must shew it was an error. As he had before mentioned, the Barons of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, were at this time employed in considering the subject, and he deeply regretted that it had been mentioned in the house of commons, until their report had been made. As it was, however, he thought it his duty to move that an humble address be presented to his majesty, that he will be graciously pleased to give directions that there be laid before the house copies of the appointments of the sheriff depute of the county of Sutherland, and of the sheriff depute of the counties of Clackmannan and Kinross; and also of the warrant granting a pension to lord Cullen, one of the senators of the college of justice; together with copies of all representations and official correspondence relating thereto.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Advocate of Scotland</member> <membercontribution>was desirous, that the letters and applications of the Sheriffs Depute for these counties should be laid before the house. Without meaning to throw any imputation on the respectable individuals who had occupied the new offices, he termed their appointment an unnecessary or wanton expense. To prove this, he entered into a history of the sheriffs depute of Scotland; they were divided into 5 classes; each class receiving a salary proportionate to its labour; by the new arrangements, the sheriff of Sutherland, who was placed in the last class but one, because no peculiar difficulty attended his situation, was to receive a higher salary than some of those in the first class. The sheriffs of Stirling and Fife had, it seems, resigned, to gave an opportunity for the new arrangements. He would like to know if they were not solicited to do so. With respect to the pension granted to lord Cullen, he would not follow the learned gent. in his detail on that subject, but he was surprised that if it was thought advisable to take such a step, it was not done in such a manner as to preclude the necessity of bringing it under the consideration of the house of common. He concluded by some severe remarks on the creation by his majesty's late ministers of two new professorships in the University Of Edinburgh&#x2014;that of Medical Jurisprudence, and that of Military Surgery.</membercontribution></p>
<col>724</col>
<p><member>Mr. C. Wynne</member> <membercontribution>defended the institution of the two new professorships. There was scarcely a college on the continent, which had not long had a professor of medical jurisprudeuce, and the advantages of having a distinct professor of military surgery were obvious.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>declared, that a more honest, upright, and able judge than Mr. Williamson, the Sheriff Depute of Stirling, could not exist. He happened to be with him when he received a letter from lord Spencer, requiring him to resign, protempore, in order that a distinct sheriff might be appointed for Clackmannan. Mr. Williamson declared to him, that such an appointment was wholly unnecessary, and exclaimed, in his Northern dialect, "Gude God, Maister Johnstone, did you ever see sic a job!" (A laugh.) With respect to the pension granted to lord Cullen, the reversion. to Mrs. Cullen was a gross insult to the morals and feelings of the people of Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>never heard of the least necessity for the appointment of the new sheriffs. As to lord Cullen's pension, the character of that learned lord certainly stood very high; but when he was thus selected from a body of men, and shewn peculiar indulgencies, he thought if indispensible that more specific grounds should be stated for such a measure than what had hitherto been advanced.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Laing</member> <membercontribution>defended the appointment of the sheriffs. The question was not, whether the sheriffs of Stirling and Fife declared that there was nothing to do in Clackmannan and Kinross, but whether the people of Clackmannan and Kinross were satisfied with the sheriffs not coming there to do any thing for them. He had never understood that lord Cullen was a very particular friend to the last administration, and he could not therefore see the justice of imputing the grant which he had received to party motives. Adverting to the arguments urged by a learned lord against the appointment of the two new professorships at Edinburgh, he observed, that similar arguments might have been applied with equal force against the appointment of Dr. Blair, as Regius Professor of the Belles Lettres; or of Dr. Walker, as Regius Professor of Natural History. Those appointments might as well be called jobs as the present; but he confessed he was not surprised, that men who had belonged to an administration the most unfriendly to literature that ever existed, and by whom genius of every description had been left to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0377"/>
<col>725</col>
pine in want&#x2014;he was not surprised that such men should condemn conduct so opposite to their own.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Marquis of Titchfield</member> <membercontribution>expressed his belief that the duke of Portland was not acquainted with the particulars of the transaction which was then the subject of debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>defended the appointment of the sheriffs. In Sutherland, in consequence of the distance of the residence of the sheriffs, justice was not delayed but not done. The country was 80 miles from sea to sea, 50 miles in the other direction; had a population of 26,000 inhabitants, and ought to have a particular sheriff. Lord Reay, who had a large property in it, had intreated him for the last five years to procure that alteration, and he lamented that whilst he had the opportunity from his Connexion with ministers, he had not endeavoured to accomplish so desirable an object. He had said thus much just to give a warning to the right hon. gentlemen opposite, that if they meant this women's war of recrimination, for the purpose of gaining popularity, they would not find it succeed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor General</member> <membercontribution>for Scotland contended that the duties of the shrievalty were now as before done by deputy, and that eminent person who had been appointed sheriff of Sutherland resided in Edinburgh, and could not have given his presence in the county for the time required by act of parliament. As the matter had been brought before the house he thought it right to be fully, fairly, and thoroughly sifted, and therefore he moved as an amendment, That there be also laid before the house copies of all official correspondence upon the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Croker</member> <membercontribution>thought that literary merit ought to be rewarded in the usual way. He was not a friend to giving indirect rewards for direct services.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>did not think the public would derive much advantage from these discussions, but the right hon. gent. who represented them as women's war of recrimination, should not lose sight of the side from which the attack was made. He should look to those who sent forth charges of attempts to raise false cries, and wished no peculation to go to the country as their cry, as if they were all purity, and their opponents the advocates of peculation. He had observed, in the late administration, that they made great professions, without any corresponding performances, and attempted to gain popularity with the public upon false
<col>726</col>
pretences. Under these circumstances, the public would derive as much advantage from the recrimination, as from the attack. The appointment of the sheriffs for Sutherland had been proposed to Mr Pitt,but he refused to accede to the alteration. The grant of a pension during pleasure to a judge was not only dangerous to the independence of the judicature but contrary to law. He had introduced these facts to the house on a former night only to shew, that the house ought to pause before they would appoint a committee, in which those gentlemen would have a preponderating influence who thought with the late ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Martin</member> <membercontribution>was extremely happy to find that he had the approbation of a right hon. gent. on the other side (Mr. Rose) whose name was so proverbial as an enemy to all jobs! That right hon. gent. could, he was well convinced, be very serviceable to the country, if he was to devote his time to an endeavour to make out discoveries of this nature, and if he had the support of parliament, the Country would not say that this was a woman's war. He was not himself, he confessed, so capable of defending against an accusation of this sort as those who had spent 14 years in extending the power of France. But on Tuesday next all these independent gentlemen would have an opportunity of testifying their zeal for the detection of abuses, by supporting the motion of a noble lord (Cochrane) for a list of those members who held pensions, places, &amp;c. either in person or by other branches of their family.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Canning</member>, <membercontribution>in a strain of irony, lamented his ability to rise, after the very able, precise, and formal speech of the learned gent. However, the necessity of the new appointments of sheriffs, he confessed he did not see to be very clearly made out, neither was the term of Medical jurisprudence, very accurately defined. And the matter of the pension to lord Cullen was still less satisfactorily explained. As the learned gent. had not given him the most ample satisfaction upon the whole, he should vote in support of the motion for the production of the papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>got up in great Warmth and alluded to what had been said by the learned gent. (Mr. Martin.) If the hon. and learned gent., said he, thinks he can put me down by any such insinuations as he has just made, he will find himself mistaken. He says that my name is connected with jobs, I dare that hon. and learned gent. to shew the instance in any part of my life in which I was con-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0378"/>
<col>727</col>
nected with any jobs. All the rewards I have receive from the public are known to the public. I never put the public to the expence of a single shilling that is not publicly known. Whether I am under or over rewarded is another question. Over rewarded I have been, I am willing to admit; but still I say, that the public have not been put to a single shilling of expence on my account, that is not publicly known. If I had concealed any reward that I had from the public, I should think myself the most scandalous person in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Martin</member> <membercontribution>said, he hoped he had spoken under and within the rules and orders of the house, since he was not checked by the chair; and while he was in that order, he should convey his ideas to the house in the manner which appeared to him the most fit.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>thought the house had heard pleasantry too long pursued, and fury too much indulged in the course of this debate. Of accusations generally and loosely made, no one disapproved mere than himself; but they were not to be got rid of by abandoning the subject in discussion. The questions here were not to be gotten rid of by the species of declamation in which the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer had indulged. When he talked, in lofty terms, of having his eye on the late administration, that he would strip off their mask, and made use of such expressions, the right hon. gent. reminded him of a considerable person of the last age, and to whom during his life considerable attention was paid by the public; he meant Mr. Pope. He had as pompously written concerning his power of exposing others as the right hon. gent. had spoken:
<quote>Yes; while I live, no rich ignoble knave</quote>
<quote>Shall walk the world in credit to his grave.</quote>
These words made some noise, and they were alarming to some persons at the time when they were written, but they were now considered as perfectly ridiculous. He cautioned the right hon. gent. against the same sort of ridicule, which would overtake him sooner than it did Pope. If the late administration had acted in any manner by which public interest had been sacrificed to private favour&#x2014;if they had, for the sake of serving their own friends, done that which was injurious to the public&#x2014;if they had given away that which nothing but merit could deserve, and bestowed it on their favourites without merit&#x2014;let the facts be exposed, and the party brought to shame; but let not the minds
<col>728</col>
of the members of the house be led away by vague and general declamation. As to the appointments of sheriffs to the counties of Sutherland and Caithness, the measure on the face of it carried so clearly its own propriety with it, that it rather was the business of those who opposed it to shew why it should not take place, than that those who favoured it should shew why it should; and the only question which he thought could be put on this part of the case, as it regarded the late administration, was, whether the appointments were made fairly and <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i>. As to the pension to lord Cullen, it was clearly intended to have been a grant for life. As to the science of Medical jurisprudence, he had only to observe, that it was known to every university in Europe, and it would be a reproach to us to be ignorant of it; for these reasons he was favourable to the motion now before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>wished to know, whether it was by intention or mistake that the precedents in the case of the grant of pensions to lords Loughborough, Eldon, and Redesdale, were departed from in the grant to Mr. Ponsonby late Chancellor for Ireland. In the former cases, the pension was to cease in case the noble lords should again be placed in the same office, or in any other of equal profit; but this limitation was left out of the grant to Mr. Ponsonby; so that if their project, that gentleman would again probably have the seals without his pension being discontinued.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>had signed the warrant by virtue of which Mr. Ponsonby was to enjoy his pension. He had signed it under the impression that it was similar to the warrants for granting pensions to the other chancellors, and would not have signed it under any other impression.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Adam</member> <membercontribution>vindicated all the circumstances that attended the pension of lord Cullen: he was intimately acquainted with them all, and was the person with whom the duke of Portland and lord Cullen had communicated upon that subject. As to the pension operating as a corrupt motive on the mind of lord Cullen, no man of any administration would venture to assert it. The same propriety he might assert, presided in the choice of the professorships, in the Universities of Scotland, and he would defy the gentlemen opposite to say, that under and former administration, such impartiality had been observed.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<col>729</col>
<p><member>[PENSIONS TO CHANCELLORS.]&#x2014;Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>begged leave to differ with the learned gentlemen who spoke last, as to this very disinterested spirit which it was pretended pervaded and characterised all the appointments of the late administration Was the pension granted to Mr. Ponsonby on his retiring from the chancellorship of Ireland of that description? was it even accompanied and checked by the usual clause that the pension of 4000l. per annum should not be enjoyed by that learned gent. in case he accepted of any other office to the same amount, or up wards? In order to place this matter in a clear point of view, he thought it his duty to move, That there be laid before the house, a copy of all the warrants, granting pensions to Chancellors in England and Ireland since the 1st of Jan. 1800.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>declared, he had no objection whatever to the motion of the hon. gent.; at the same time he could not help thinking, that the hon. gent was not the most qualified person in the world to resist improper grants, when a Certain marriage settlement was recollected, and many other grants to the hon. gent. his family, and connections, got by what means, the Lord only knew, and for what the Devil only knew. It Was not a happy measure to come from that side of the house, when he looked round, and observed that every member then sitting on the Treasury Bench, all of them, to a man, enjoyed some place, pension, or grant, either contingent to themselves, or in reversion to expectancy, as provision for their families and relatives; he could not think this motion came with much grace from that side of the house. If he was to single out one man more than another, as the most unqualified man, taking all the circumstances into consideration, he would say the hon. gent. was the most improper and the least qualified to bring forward such a motion in that house. The noble lord believed it was not the intention of the late government, to give Mr. Ponsonby more than Other chancellors had received before him. Those who knew the character of Mr. Ponsonby, those who were acquainted with his independence and liberality of sentiment, well knew, that he himself would be the first to cancel any improper grant made to him, he would be the last man in existence to take advantage of such an act. He should say no upon this subject, except to declare, that it was not the intention of his majesty's late ministers to make this grant different from all others of the same kind; and if it became neces-
<col>730</col>
sary to bring a bill into parliament to rectify such an error, should the hon. gent. move it, he would be the first to second his motion. But what, he asked, was all this objection for? to what end did it lead? to what good could it tend? He thought all this was calculated for the sole purpose of diverting the Public attention from those inquiries which the house wished to set on foot. The cry of "No peculation," to be sure, was most properly applied by gentlemen at the other side of the house; and he hoped that the charges that had been made, would not be found to prevail with the public to give up inquiry; but that if any improper offices had been appointed, the house should examine and condemn or censure as they found expedient. But this was not the object of the gentlemen opposite; no&#x2014;their object was but too apparent&#x2014;their wish was to lead the attention of the house and of the public to these topics of improper appointments and grants in order to cover with some pretence or other, the late alterations in his majesty's ministry, and the new appointments on the committee of finance. Upon the latter subject, then, what had been done? The right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer had appointed 8 new members, all of whom were selected by himself, in order to give him a decided Majority. This, he trusted, would not be forgotten. It would also be recollected, that 3 members of the former committee, among whom he must first name Mr. Sharpe and Mr. Lamb, who were objected to by that right hon. gent. as unfit members of that committee, because they were the most attentive of all those who attended, and the most indefatigable in seeking out abuses and detecting peculation in every shape. The third gentleman, who had been rejected by this right hon. and learned gent. was his hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread), for no other reason whatever, but because he was the active prosecutor of lord Melville. Sorry was he to witness the general spirit of attack and recrimination witnessed within that house; it was not a season for it; but when one party was continually throwing out dark and ambiguous hints, threatening to expose a something here, and to detect a something there; perhaps the best, the most manly way to resist such vague attacks was by bold, express, and direct opposition&#x2014;to answer hints by facts, and senseless cries by a demand for immediate inquiry. He begged pardon of the house for trespassing so long at so late an hour; he had been hurried to a greater length than he had intended to have
<image src="S1V0009P0I0380"/>
<col>731</col>
gone, but it was not easy for a man to keep his temper, when he heard of charges and accusations, and saw what kind of men they were that preferred them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>denied that he had said any thing in the slightest degree derogatory to the late chancellor Ponsonby, for whom he professed the most unfeigned respect.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-07-03">Friday, July 3.</date>
<p><member>[PENSIONS TO CHANCELLORS.] Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>regretted that the noble lord (Howick) was not present, to whom he had last night addressed a question respecting the omission in the grant of a pension to the late Irish Chancellor (Mr. Ponsonby) on his retiring from office, of the usual clause respecting the pension, should he again accept a situation of trust or emolument. He had since received information that this was owing to a mistake in the grant on this side of the water, and that in the warrant issued from the Treasury in Ireland, the proper clause was inserted. He trusted that no one was less disposed than himself to throw out an unfounded insinuation on any man, or any set of men. But he had been deceived by the mistake in the grant, which certainly did exist. He therefore moved, that the order which had last night been made for the production of the grant be discharged. Ordered. Soon after,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>entered the house, and observed, that his anxiety on this subject had been so great, that on the adjournment of the house last night, he had lost no time, but had called on Mr. Ponsonby, to ascertain the truth of the hon. gent's, assertion. Mr. Ponsonby could not inform him whether or not the grant contained the clause alluded to; but he assured him that he had never the slightest idea whatever of accepting the pension, without the usual conditions; and he had since then written to lord Hawkesbury, stating, that should the clause actually have been omitted in the grant, he was ready to surrender it for the purpose of its insertion. He (lord Howick) confidently appealed to the gentlemen of Ireland, whether there had ever been a chancellor, who had discharged the important duties of his high office with greater ability, diligence; and advantage to the public? When he first succeeded to the office, the Chancery Court of Dublin was in arrears for six years of Notices, for 600 Motions, and for 427 Causes; when he quitted office, he had got under all the notices and motions, and had
<col>732</col>
brought down the causes to 200, besides going through with the current business. Had he remained in office a few months longer, not a single cause would have been left undetermined. He wished that the hon. gent. would, in future, be more cautions in preferring his accusations; it would have been more candid, had he carefully inquired into this subject; before he brought it forward for the consideration of the house of commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>repeated his former statement. The clause had certainly been omitted in the grant on this side of the water, and be was therefore justified in imagining that it might have been omitted in Ireland, and that it was intended to be so.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[NAVY, ARMY, AND ORDNANCE ESTIMATES.]</member> <membercontribution>The house resolved itself into a Committee of Supply. The Speaker having left the chair,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Ward</member> <membercontribution>stated that the Navy Estimates were, with little variation, the same as the last Estimates. He had nothing more to do, therefore, than to move the following resolutions. That 130,000 Seamen be allowed for the year 1807, including 31,400 Royal Marines. That 3,126,500l. be granted for wages for these seamen for 13 months, at 1l. 8s. per man, per month. That 3,211,000l. be granted for victualling the men for 13 months, at the rate of 1l. 18s. per man per month. That 5,070,000l. be granted for the wear and tear of the ships, at the rate of 31. per month. That 422,500l. be granted for the sea service in advance. That 1,135,474l. be granted for the half-pay of the navy. That 2,134,903l. be granted for naval buildings and extra works. That 1,500,000l. be granted for the hire of transports for the year 1807. That 300,000l. be granted for the sick and wounded seamen. That 500,000l. be granted for the prisoners of war at home and abroad.&#x2014;These resolutions were put and agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War</member> <membercontribution>then rose and said; that he need not trouble the house any farther than by moving the following resolutions;&#x2014;that 113,795 effective men be allowed for the land forces. That 4,051,623l. be allowed for the pay of these troops. That 2,609,143l. be allowed for the troops in the plantations. That 125,214l. be allowed for the dragoons. That 277,249l. be allowed for the charge of recruiting and contingencies. That 190,529l. 17s. 6d. be granted for the staff officers. 2,493,664l. for the embodied militia. 622,153l. for the militia contingencies. 157,227l. 16s. for the charges of clothing the militia. 34,483l. for the full

pay of the supernumerary officers. 467,273l. for the increased rate of subsistance. 186,082l. for the half-pay of the land forces. 55,330l. for allowances to reduced military officers. 44,000l. for the half-pay of our American forces. 406,380l. for the Chelsea out-pensioners. 43,258l. for Kilmainham hospital. 832,540l. for defraying the charge of foreign corps. 22,175l. for the Royal Military College. 21,247l. for the Royal Military Asylum. 18,462l. for Chelsea Hospital. 469,450l. for the barrack department.&#x2014;These resolutions were put and carried.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ashton</member> <membercontribution>moved the ordnance estimates, which were, 2,278,197l. for the ordnance of the land service. 301,406l. for the service of the year 1805. 262,365l. for the service of the year 1806. 471,246l. for the ordnance of Ireland.&#x2014;The resolutions were put and carried.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[PETITION AGAINST MR. GALWAY MILLS.] Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition from Mr. Elliott of New Bond-street, against Mr. Galway Mills, who was then in custody of the Marshal of the King's Bench, for a debt due to the petitioner, when he was returned to the present parliament. The petition stated, that in the course of business two bills of exchange had come from Mr. Mills into the hands of the petitioner, which had been respectively dishonoured; that Mr. Mills was also indebted in considerable sums to the petitioner for work done, goods sold, and money advanced; that in last Michaelmas Term the said Mr. Mills had, upon process out of the Court of King's Bench, been taken into the custody of the marshal of the said court, but had entered a sham demurrer, which he had afterwards abandoned; that in last Trinity Term the petitioner had obtained judgment for 1013<i>l</i>. but that execution had been stayed by a writ of error brought by the said Mr Mills, to evade justice, and in order to escape the payment of his legal debts; that as no bail can be taken to an action pending a writ of error, the said Mr. Mills was in custody of the marshal of the King's Bench, when he was returned to the present parliament as a representative for the borough of St. Michael's; that the petitioner was informed that Mr. Mills had it in contemplation to apply for his liberation to that house, he having a considerable colonial property in the West
<col>734</col>
Indies, with a view to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the courts, and for the purpose of evading justice; that under these circumstances the lord chancellor would not grant the writ "Ne exeat Regno;" that if the said Mr. Mills should be discharged out of custody by that house, the petitioner would be greatly injured; and that the petitioner therefore prayed that honourable house that it would be pleased to take such measures on the premises as to its wisdom should seem meet, and that petitioner might be heard by himself or his council, to prove the facts and allegations in his petition &#x2014;This petition was ordered to lie on the table, as were also similar petitions presented against the same gentleman, by Mr. Cochrane Johnstone, from Mr. Allen, of Bondstreet; and by Mr. P. Moore, from a creditor, to the amount of 19,200<i>l</i>.&#x2014;The petitions were ordered to lie on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[STATE OF THE NATION.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>rose and addressed the house as follows:&#x2014;I am not, Sir, altogether unaccustomed to address this assembly. During the number of years I have had the honour of a seat among you, it has been my lot to bring forward several important propositions, some of which have experienced a favourable reception, but the greater part a determined opposition. Yet never have I been in the habit of making any apology for the insufficiency of the proposer, however strongly I felt it, thinking it better to rely on the solidity of the grounds upon which my propositions rested, than to attempt conciliating attention by apologies. But I must confess on this occasion, whether from the growing diffidence of the public in public men; whether from the manner in which I have been recently spoken of in this assembly; whether from the nature of the debates which have lately taken place amongst us, in which a spirit of attack and recrimination has been manifested, by no means calculated to raise the character of this house [a loud cry of hear! hear!] whether from the disastrous state of the times, or whether from all these feelings combined, I never rose with so great a degree of diffidence and solicitude. If in my endeavours to bring back the gravity of debate&#x2014;to get rid of the spirit of recrimination which has too long prevailed amongst us, and to retrieve the falling fortunes of this mighty empire &#x2014;Here </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dennis Browne </member>, <membercontribution>of Mayo, moved the standing order for the exclusion of strangers; in consequence of which the gallery was immediately cleared, and strangers
<image src="S1V0009P0I0382"/>
<col>735</col>
were not re-admitted during the remainder of the evening.&#x2014;Notwithstanding the above circumstance, we are, however, enabled, from an authentic source of information, to communicate to our readers the following outline of this important debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>proceeded to lay grounds for the motion he intended to offer, and stated as the reasons and objects of inquiry, the state of our Sugar-colonies, and the danger to which our East-India empire was exposed; he alluded to the mutiny at Vellore, and seemed to think it arose from a deeper and more general feeling, than the impolitic and ill-judged military regulations which had been assigned as its cause. The state of the sister kingdom, he also thought, should be inquired into in a committee of the whole house; he feared Ireland was not so cordial as she should be in our common cause, and he desired to place her in the same situation of loyalty and good affection and security as Devonshire or Yorkshire. He was aware that Catholic emancipation could not and ought not now to be farther attempted, but there were other means of allaying animosity, and conciliating affection; among many such means he should allude to that of a system of tythes which an hon. gent. on the other side (Mr. Croker) who did not usually agree with his hon. friends, had allowed to be a subject of much consequence, and if carefully managed, pregnant with good effects. He should not dwell at greater length on this subject, because he felt it might be more effectually discussed hereafter, but beyond doubt that discussion in a committee on the state of the station was absolutely necessary. He would also assert that the extraordinary dissolution of the late parliament demanded an enlarged inquiry, and he insisted that the doctrines on which that and the preceding measures were sought to be justified, viz. that the king could at any moment act without an adviser, tended to despotism, and the subversion of the constitution. He disapproved of his majesty's late choice of ministers: he thought one of them (the chancellor of the exchequer) a person not likely to gain the confidence of Ireland; and he considered the right hon. secretary (Mr. Canning) as little calculated, from his temper, his feelings, and the whole course of his political life, to conciliate that country with which he (Mr. W.) should never cease to hope that negociations for peace might speedily be renewed. He ob-
<col>736</col>
served also that the recal of lord Melville to his majesty's councils deserved serious inquiry and deep reprehension, though he would not say that it was illegal, or contrary to the resolutions of that house. He concluded by recapitulating his statements, and moving that a committee be appointed to inquire into the State of the Nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Milnes</member> <membercontribution>replied to the arguments of the hon. gent. He stated that the proposed inquiry would be vague and delusive; that it was an attempt to censure the late change of administration, and to embarrass the measures of government; that many of the grounds which had been urged by the hon. gent. for going into the committee, had equally existed, during the continuance of the late administration, when no such notice had been made by the hon. gent. or his friends; he represented the state of the country to be such as required the exertions of the united energies of all descriptions of its subjects, which it was the object of this motion to distract. Looking to our resources, to the patriotism and valour of the country, he saw nothing to fear, but much to expect. Were we to countenance the exertions of our allies by examples of British valour; were we to evince by our conduct a conviction of the fact, that the path of peace was only to be found under the arch of victory, he had no doubt but the ultimate issue of the contest would be honourable to the country. With a conviction of these truths on his mind, and for a variety of other reasons, he was so far from giving his support to the motion, that he should move that this house do now adjourn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>said a few word nearly similar to those he had used on a former occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Pigott</member> <membercontribution>went into a legal statement to shew the illegality of the doctrine of the king's acting without advisers, and drew a distinction between the sovereign in his executive and in his legislative capacities, and asserted strongly that it was in his executive capacity alone that the coronation oath was binding upon him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Henry Smith</member> <membercontribution>considered the proposed mode of inquiry to be of all others the least eligible, and indeed to be only brought forward for party purposes; he therefore thought it beneath the dignity and justice of the house to bend itself to such a proceeding: the present ministers had done nothing to forfeit the confidence of the country, and
<image src="S1V0009P0I0383"/>
<col>737</col>
till they skewed themselves unworthy, he, and he trusted the house, would support them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dennis Browne</member> <membercontribution>apologized to the house for the haste and perhaps indiscretion with which he had obliged strangers to withdraw, but he trusted the house would pardon what had been occasioned by an impulse of surprise and sorrow at hearing the hon. mover talk of "the fallen fortunes of this country;" nor did the continuation of the hon. member's speech shew that his measure was so unnecessary or indiscreet as it might have been thought; for surely the manner in which he had treated the affairs of Ireland was not calculated to do good by being promulgated. He assured the house he had acted from the impulse of duty in this matter, with great personal pain and reluctance; a pain that would be greatly increased if he thought the house disapproved of his proceeding.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. M. Montague</member> <membercontribution>opposed the motion as tending, to no good practical end.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. A. Herbert</member> <membercontribution>said a few words in favour of the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Tarleton</member> <membercontribution>went at some length into the details of the campaign in Poland, and expressed his confident opinion, that, in a military point of view, the position of Buonaparte was extremely critical.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. William Adam</member> <membercontribution>spoke in favour of the motion. He argued some of the legal points already touched upon by sir A Pigott. He observed freely on the state of Ireland, and concluded by shewing, by many examples, how constitutional the proposed measure was at all time, and how peculiarly useful it would be at this.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>opposed the motion, as nugatory and even dangerous. It stood on no good theory, and it tended to no good practice; the variety of topics which would divide the attention of a committee of the whole house, would tender it impossible to maintain any regular discussion, or to arrive at any useful conclusion; every gentleman would introduce his own favourite subject, and the committee would lose, its patience and its time in endless debate. But, really, from those party subjects, he wished gentlemen would turn their attention to the awful situation of public affairs. He had heard an honourable friend of his (Mr. Milnes) with great pleasure and admiration, but he would not be so sanguine in his hopes of the country, as the more ardent mind and the better spirits of his youthful friend caused him to be. He did fear much, and with that so-
<col>738</col>
lemn impression on him, he could not avoid lamenting that gentlemen in that house and the people at large, seemed not aware of the extent of the danger, and suffered their thoughts to be distracted to petty objects, from the great and paramount duty of preparing for the most momentous of contests. He had, indeed, hopes, which arose, however, from causes different from those that some hon. gentlemen seemed to build upon; he had hopes from moral causes, surer than mere human agency in their effect, and more complete and decisive in their results. He trusted that those causes would act as they had hitherto in all ages and times invariably done, and in that trust it was that he had hopes for this country. The hon. gent. then alluded to the state of Ireland, and quoted Dr. M'Nevin's opinion before the Secret Committee, to shew that the denial or delay of Catholic Emancipation was not the real cause of the disturbances of that country. He recommended to the gentry of that part of the empire, an indulgent and conciliating conduct with regard to the people; and above all, he recommended to the consideration of the well-wishers of Ireland, the introduction of some general system of education and morality, which, he ventured to assert, would do more towards composing that country, than any political measures that could be devised.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>went over, at considerable length, the arguments already urged in favour of the original motion, and followed sir A. Pigott and Mr. Adam in the line of their arguments on the legal points which had incidentally arisen.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>would opposes the motion as unnecessary, and in some degree impossible to be carried into effect. If inquiry was necessary, why not institute it on specific grounds&#x003F; would it not tend to a more clear and satisfactory exposition, to consider each article that called for consideration, on its own single merits, than in the general and sweeping stile proposed by this motion. The right hon. member adverted to the opinion pronounced by him on a former occasion, viz. that there are particular conjunctures in which the king must act for himself: he had reconsidered, he said, this opinion, and he found himself strengthened in it by that reconsideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>made some observations on Mr. Wilberforce's speech, in which he attempted to correct some errors and mistatements of the hon. gent. He then proceeded to say a few words on the original
<image src="S1V0009P0I0384"/>
<col>739</col>
question, and finally expressed his resolution to support the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Croker</member> <membercontribution>rose to defend the hon. gent. (Mr. Wilberforce) from the erroneous and uncandid reply of the right hon. baronet. He contended that Mr. Wilberforce's quotation of doctor M'Nevin was correct, and whatever might be his own opinion on the great question, he must say that the hon. member's statements were fully warranted and supported by the passages referred to. Mr. Croker replied to the several articles of Mr Whitbread's speech, and said that his surprise at this vague motion was the greater, from his knowing that there stood in the order-book of that house, notices for specific inquiry into almost every one of the topics which the hon. gentleman proposed to treat of in the indefinite and desultory stile inseparable from a committee on the state of the nation. He proceeded to refute the assertions and arguments of the hon mover, which, whatever he thought of them, had so pleased the gentlemen on the opposite side, that they had used no other, but had contented themselves with repeating the speech of the hon. mover. One learned doctor (Laurence) in particular, fearing, he supposed, that its strong sense and reasoning were too hot, pungent, and essential for common palates, had kindly diluted the hon. gentleman's arguments in a quantity of his own cool weak, and innoxions eloquence.&#x2014;The hon. member, after observing in a strain of irony on the merits of the last administration, concluded by referring to Mr. Wilberforce's awful description of our political situation, by expressing a wish that we should excite no divisions at home to encourage enemies abroad, and that, while the farmer, the artizan, and the tradesman cheerfully contribute their little profits and comforts to the exigencies of the state, those whose superior fortunes rendered the payment of taxes no sacrifice to them, should contribute what their country did claim from their patriotism&#x2014;the sacrifice of their passions, their prejudices and their parties, to the common interests of England and of Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>blamed the style of confident accusation which the last member had indulged in. That hon. gent.'s parliamentary experience was not long, and he thought it would not be too much to ask, that the hon. gent. should be more known to the hon. members, before he arraigned them so freely. After alluding to what had fallen from the hon, member for Yorkshire,
<col>740</col>
the hon. gent. was returning to some observations on the gentleman who had spoken last, when the cry for the question became so loud and strong, that after a few words, the hon. member was pleased to sit down.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>refuted the legal doctrines of the hon. gentlemen on the other side of the house. He insisted that occasions must and ought to occur in which the king could have no adviser, and must act from his own feeling and sense of duty; he would state a case to the house, which, he relied upon it, would, in their opinion, warrant his assertion; he would suppose that, on the very first occasion on which the noble lord opposite (Howick) had proposed a late celebrated measure to the consideration of the king, his majesty should have thought fit to tell the noble lord that he conceived the measure to be so mischievous, that he could no longer confide in the proposer of it. Suppose he had, at that very audience, and without quitting the noble lord, demanded from him the seals of office, and so dismissed him from his service, would it be asserted that, in this case, the king would not have acted for himself? would gentlemen say, that, in such a case, he must have had an adviser, where advice was impossible; and would it be asserted, that such a case as he now put was an improbable one? He relied not on this case alone, though that were enough, but any true constitutional principle, and all true constitutional practice, was also with him. He never denied, or would deny, the general principle that ministers were responsible for all acts done in their ministry; but he would deny that they were responsible for acts done before their ministry. What if the king of England should choose (he would for argument's sake suppose the case).capriciously or improperly to dismiss a minister, must the successor to that minister bear the responsibility of the dismissal he disapproved? If he were doomed to that responsibility, no man could accept the office, and the consequences would be, Unit no man in England could fill the employment, except the very man who had been dismissed, and who, from the difference between him and his sovereign, was the last man in England who should be called to it. But, though he thus chose to argue the matter upon principle, he would say that, in point of fact, he should have no hesitation or fear in taking upon himself the full responsibility of his majesty's late measures. Were the king now placed in a situation
<image src="S1V0009P0I0385"/>

similar to that in which he stood on a late occasion, and were to ask for his advice, he would, under the weight of his official responsibility, fearlessly advise his majesty to the very measures which the gentlemen on the other side had arraigned. The right hon. gent. said, that the other parts of the question had been so ably and decisively settled by his hon. friends who had spoken in this debate, that he felt it unnecessary to consider them; and he concluded by saying, that the hon. gent. (Mr. Milnes) who had moved the question of adjournment, could not have been aware, that some other orders of the day remained undischarged, and he would therefore suggest the withdrawing that motion, and putting a direct negative on the original question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>rose at that late hour, not to trouble the house very long; he would willingly have declined speaking altogether, but what fell from the hon. gentlemen on the other side imperiously demanded some notice. He asserted that the able speech of his hon. friend had not been answered; the observations of an hon. gent. on the other side (Mr. Croker), professing to be in reply to his hon. friend, he thought contained more of fresh accusations against his majesty's late ministers, than of reply. The hon. gent. with sense force, undoubtedly, had pressed some points upon the house; but he must call upon that hon. gent. if he saw real grounds of charge against his majesty's late ministers, to bring it forward specifically and boldly, and <i>he</i> pledged himself to meet it as specifically and freely. The hon. gent. had deprecated his (lord Howick's) advocation for Ireland, he must say, that not only as a member of the united parliament, but as one privately connected with Ireland by the dearest ties, he was as interested in the welfare of Ireland as the hon. gent.; and he hoped the hon. gent. would give him credit for saying, that he never had, nor never would speak a syllable, or do an act injurious to Ireland. He considered that part of the empire as the most imperative in its calls for attention and care, and though he could not say that any measure of catholic indulgence should now be brought forward, he would say that good policy called for a general system of conciliation and kindness; a system which he found the Irish did not very confidently expect from the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer. The noble lord answered, in much detail, the legal arguments of the right. hon. gent. which he contended were
<col>742</col>
founded on suppositions which the house would not presume. He also adverted very warmly to the accusations made against him, and those who acted with him, by two hon. gentlemen on the other side. To one in particular (Mr. Milnes), he begged to say, that his and his friends conduct, for twelve years preceding his coming into office, which had been so seriously reproached to him by the hon. member from the Sister Kingdom, had had, during all that period, the support and assistance of the father of that hon. gent. (Mr. Milnes); he would also say, that the young and hon. gent. the son of a man he entirely esteemed, had dealt in assertions more easy to make than to prove. He was anxious to have his conduct examined, but he thought he might at least claim, till it was examined, a suspension of the heavy judgments which the hon. member had passed upon him. The noble lord entered into some details relative to our foreign relations, and concluded with saying, that he should vote for the committee, as timely, useful, and necessary.&#x2014; Mr. Croker, general Stewart, and Mr. Whitbread, each said a few words; and, Mr. Milnes withdrawing his motion for adjournment, the house divided, when there appeared,

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-07-07">Tuesday, July 7.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>The Speaker called the attention of the house to a letter which he had received from Mr. Galway Mills, a member of the house; which he read from the chair, as follows:&#x2014;"Temple Place, Black-friars Road, July 6. Sir, I have to inform you, and through you to submit to the house, that I was in arrest with the Marshal of the King's Bench, upon mesne process, previous to my being returned to the present parliament for the borough of Midshal, and that I still continue under the same restraint. Under these circumstances, I beg to submit my case to the house, that it may afford me that redress, and adopt the proceedings, which the occasion will seem to it to require. I have the honour to be, &amp;c." On the motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the proceedings upon Mr. Speed's case (Dec. 1795) were read, He supposed
<col>744</col>
the house would of course follow this precedent now. He thought it right at the same time to move, that the petitions presented yesterday, by persons stating Mr. Mills to be indebted to them, should be referred to the said committee.&#x2014;An order was accordingly made to that effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[STANDING ORDER FOR THE EXCLUSION OF STRANGERS.] Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, no person was more disposed to respect the general standing orders of the house than he was, and he was sure that when any member moved that any of these orders should be enforced, it was from the impulse of the best motives. The proceedings, however, which were sometimes adopted with respect to the order for the exclusion of strangers, seemed to him to require to be explained, and to be placed on more satisfactory grounds. When it was considered that strangers were, by the standing order, never to be admitted, no construction of that standing order could be interpreted into a right of commanding those to withdraw, who were to he presumed not to be present. The words of the standing order were not to admit strangers, and if any stranger intruded, the order provided that he should be taken into custody by the serjeant at arms. He did not think it right that a matter of such moment should he left in so undefined a state, and after what had happened yesterday, it became more necessary than ever to come to a fixed understanding upon it. If the public was not to be allowed to know what the state of the nation was, it was hard to say what it should be allowed to know. He therefore gave notice, that he meant on Friday to draw the attention of the house to this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dennis Browne</member> <membercontribution>was extremely sorry if any thing had fallen from him contrary to the general sense of the house. The fact was, that he had not moved that the gallery should be cleared, but on hearing things fall from the hon. gent. which he thought might be injurious, if suffered to go abroad, he thought it his duty to notice that there were strangers in the house; and it appeared, that when once such a deviation from the standing order was noticed, there was no discretion for him, or for the Speaker, or for the house; it must necessarily and immediately be enforced.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>said, that as this matter was mentioned, he thought it his duty to state what was the present practice and usage of the house, and what, as being the usage, he thought it his duty to adopt and enforce,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0387"/>
<col>745</col>
till it should be altered. Whether the house should lightly alter a usage so established, would be for its consideration. From the standing order, forbidding the admission of strangers, it was clear they could be in the house only by sufferance. For enforcing the exclusion, if necessary, the standing order directed that those who intruded themselves should be taken into the custody of the serjeant at arms. But this he looked upon only as a mode of getting rid of their presence if it should be an inconvenience, or if they should improperly come in, or persist in remaining. With respect to the obligation of enforcing the order, it was indispensable: if any member noticed the presence of strangers, he (the Speaker) had no choice, the house had no choice, they must be put forth. This was the ancient and established usage. If the house should now be disposed to alter it, it would do well to consider whether any new practice that might be substituted would accord equally well with its dignity or its convenience.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>wished the ancient and established usage on this head to remain unaltered, for, although he deprecated, as much as his hon. friend, the exclusion of strangers, he was satisfied no new arrangement with respect to them would be equally conducive to the dignity and the convenience of the house. The right of exclusion had been seldom exercised, and in the course of his experience, he had never known it to he exercised with advantage. The exclusion of last night was particularly unwise. It seemed the hon. gent. thought something that he had said would have an injurious effect on the public mind, if suffered to go abroad. But the expression, whatever it was, that struck the hon. gent. as improper, did go abroad. If what he had said was capable of refutation, it ought to go abroad, accompanied by the refutation. If it could not be refuted, it ought to go abroad with the authority of incontrovertible truth. The member who enforced the right of exclusion ought to be sure that he exercised it with a sound discretion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[PLACES, PENSIONS, SINECURES, &amp;c. HELD BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.] Lord Cochrane</member> <membercontribution>rose in pursuance of the notice he had given; in doing which, he was influenced by no other motive than that of an anxious wish to discharge a great public duty. If his motion was acceded to, the result would prove, whether there was any possibility of making those who had lived
<col>746</col>
and grown rich upon the public money, feel for the extraordinary burdens under which the people laboured. The late plan of finance had proved that as much as could have been exacted had been drawn from the people, and that it was not possible to draw more: ingenuity had exhausted itself in devising new sources of taxation. The people knew all this. If he was asked, how he could so judge of the public sentiment, he in answer should appeal to the universal sentiment without doors; the variety of publications; the language held upon the hustings throughout the empire during the late election; the language made use of in the different advertisements from the successful candidates to their constituents, and if all these together did not enable a man to form a just estimate of public opinion, he did not know what could do so; nor was it to be forgotten, the different shameless notices that appeared in the different papers, concerning the sale of seats in a certain assembly. At the same time he wished it to be understood, that nothing was farther from his intention, than to complain of the allowances made to the efficient public officers; so far from thinking those allowances as extravagant, he thought them rather under than over what they should be. Revolutionary views might be imputed to him, as they were to others who wished for such investigations; but he was actuated by the purest motives, and he hoped for the unanimous concurrence of the house. It was proper to shew the people, that there was nothing in the character and habits of those who composed the house, that ought to be concealed. He therefore moved, "That a Committee be appointed to inquire into, and report to this house, an account of all Offices, Posts, Places, Sinecures, Pensions, Situations, Fees, Perquisites, and Emoluments of every description, paid out of, or arising from, the public revenues, or the fees of any Courts of Law, Equity, Admiralty, Ecclesiastical, or other Courts, held or enjoyed by, or in trust for, any Member of this House, his wife, or any of his descendants, for him, or either of them, in reversion of any present interest; with an account of the annual amount of such Office, Post, Place, Sinecure, Pension, Situation, Fees, Perquisites, and Emoluments, distinguishing whether the same arises from a certain salary, or from any average amount; that this inquiry do extend to the whole of his majesty's dominions, and that said com-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0388"/>
<col>747</col>
mittee be empowered to send for persons, papers, and records."&#x2014;Mr. Cochrane Johnstone seconded the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bankes</member> <membercontribution>thought the information desired by the noble lord desirable in many respects; but it would be neither practicable nor proper to pass the order in its present shape. There was no precedent of such an order on the Journals, though the house had frequently thought it right to interpose and check the excessive or improper distribution of salaries, pensions, and emoluments, derived from the public. So extensive a field of inquiry could hardly be reduced to any of the known rules adopted by committees of the house. The places held by members of parliament were besides known, and the pension list was either regularly laid on the table every session, or might be on the motion of any member. The committee in which he had the honour to preside (the Committee of Finance) had ordered the pension list to be laid before it, and would proceed to examine the circumstances connected with it in the next session. It was invidious and improper to convey to the public an insinuation, that members of parliament were influenced by considerations of private advantage for themselves or their dependents. He knew no ground, for casting at the present time an imputation never cast at any former time. For it was most essential, that at this critical period, the character of the house should not be degraded or depreciated. It was also unfair, as well as impolitic and unpatriotic, to depreciate the resources of the country, as the noble lord had done, by stating that we were on the verge of bankruptcy. Though sensible of the difficulties of the times, and of the relief arising from the judicious suspension of taxation, every man of judgment, who considered the situation of the country, would allow there were ample resources to meet the difficulties that we had to encounter. He did not see how the advertisements for the purchase and sale of seats, in a certain assembly, should be construed into an argument of the general corruption of members of parliament. He agreed with the noble lord, that the public servants, and particularly those of the higher classes, were rather under than overpaid. There was only one species of pensions, which it was necessary to inquire particularly into. Within the 3 last years the several public departments had got into the practice of granting pensions within themselves,
<col>748</col>
without complying with the provisions of Mr. Burke's act, that all pensions should be from the Exchequer only. Some of the public departments had withdrawn themselves even from the controul of the treasury in this respect. On the whole, however, anxious for enquiry and desirous to afford the public information, he could not consent to pass the noble lord's motion in its present shape.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Curwen</member> <membercontribution>had hoped the noble lord's motion would have passed without a dissenting voice. He had hoped some measures would be taken to put an end to the disgraceful scenes that had formed the subject of such discreditable crimination and recrimination a few nights since. It was no objection that there was no precedent; the unprecedented state of the thing was a stronger ground for the investigation. When the exigency of the times was such as to require the exertion of every arm, the want of precedent was not to be pleaded in bar to the satisfaction due to the public mind. The Finance Committee had an extensive range of enquiry before it, and ought not to suffer a day to elapse without reporting something. That committee was not constituted exactly as he thought it should be; as the change was made, he had no objection to the gentlemen introduced. The practice of granting pensions without the controul of the treasury or the exchequer, was a stronger ground of inquiry. When it was recorded on the journals, that seats in the house were bought and sold like bullocks in Smithfield market (Mr. Horne Tooke's petition), it was too much to find fault with the noble lord for adverting to newspaper advertisements. He complained that the power of the crown had greatly increased since it had been declared to be already excessive; and as a friend to the democratic part of the constitution, he wished to see that excessive power reduced within proper bounds. The excess of power rendered it insecure; and when the influence of corruption and weakness was combined with the operation of that excessive power, the danger was enhanced, and the mischief aggravated. While he said this, however, he did not go the length of the individual (sir F. Burdett) who had so rashly expressed himself in wishing to see the accursed leaves of the Red Book destroyed. He conceived that that person must not have been well acquainted with the nature of that book. It was one which differed materially from the Livre-Rouge in France;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0389"/>
<col>749</col>
for it contained many offices of great utility to the country; also, he did not deny that it contained many abuses; and he wished to God that they were effectually removed. To refuse such an inquiry as this, would be to do the house more mischief than all the abuse of all the Corresponding Societies could do. Without shewing a disposition to satisfy the public in a case of this kind, the right hon. gent. (Mr. Perceval) would count in vain upon his majorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>hoped, that as there was no doubt that an opinion prevailed as to the existence of much corruption in the house, the motion would be so framed, as to refute that opinion, or at least to shew in what degree and in what instance it was warranted. The object of the noble lord seemed to be, to place under one collected view, a mass of information now detached, and in many instances inaccessible. If the motion was referred to the committee of finance, with an instruction to inquire into and report upon the matter contained in it, the report would probably be of a most useful description.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, that no opposition would be made to the motion, if the noble mover would assent to a modification, such as was suggested from the other side. It was his wish to give all possible information. To call for a return of all those connected with members of parliament would be to lead to an endless list of persons, from which no practical result could be derived. Officers in the army and navy, for instance, and on the half pay would be included. If the matter was referred to the committee, it might inquire not only into pensions held by members of parliament, which would be distinguished by the names, but into all pensions, by whomsoever held. The lists of pensions and places might be had from the different departments; but, if the inquiry of the committee was deemed satisfactory, he saw no objection to it. He thought the motion ought to be extended in some respects, and narrowed in others, in order to give it a useful and not unnecessary range. The crown being allowed the power of granting pensions to a certain amount, it would be competent to inquire before the report of the committee, as well as after, whether the pension list ought to be reduced. The house having fixed the amount to be granted, he questioned whether it would be right to canvass the propriety of every individual grant. He did not know whether the course be proposed fell in with the views of the hon. gentlemen opposite. He looked
<col>750</col>
for no support, but from a strict performance of his duty. He should never seek popularity by false representations injurious to members of parliament, and tending to excite a distrust of the means of the country. He was unwilling that any information practically beneficial should be withheld. The committee would inquire into the nature and extent of the pensions and emoluments, and by whom they were held.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Ossulston</member> <membercontribution>was of opinion that it was most desirable the house and the country should be acquainted with the facts, whatever they might be. He thought that the noble lord's motion did not go far enough, and was afraid that the return to it would not be completely satisfactory to the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. J. Smith</member> <membercontribution>had extensive communications with his numerous constituents; and he was sorry to say, that their sentiments, and especially the sentiments of the middling class, were not favourable to the independence of parliament. An opinion certainly prevailed that the house of commons was not so independent as it ought to be. For his part, he had a high opinion of the character of parliament; and he was anxious that the motion might be agreed to, in order to prove how small was the number of corrupt. He differed completely from an hon. gent. who had spoken against the increasing power of the crown. At the present awful moment, it would be most injudicious to diminish it. He was as adverse to the diminution of the power of the crown at that moment, as he was to the disunion of the people by a religious cry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lethbridge</member> <membercontribution>complimented the fairness with which the chancellor of the exchequer had met this question. He Was glad that such a motion had been brought forward, because he knew many populous districts in his county who were open-mouthed about pensions and places; this motion, if adopted, would tend to undeceive them, by shewing, that they did not extend to that degree as to endanger the safety of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Littleton</member> <membercontribution>defended the noble lord's motion, against the objections of the hon. gent., who had said that there was no precedent for such a step. Were not the times unprecedented? It was worth while at a period like the present, when the minds of the people were so full of suspicions at least to endeavour to shew that they were without foundation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Sebright</member> <membercontribution>would support the noble lord's motion, or something resembling it, because the public entertained doubts on this
<image src="S1V0009P0I0390"/>
<col>751</col>
subject, which an investigation of this sort was best calculated to remove. He disclaimed all connection with party, although he entertained a high respect for his majesty's present ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>thought that the adoption of this motion would tend to strengthen the constitutional power of the crown, and he agreed that this was not the time to weaken that constitutional power. At the same time, he did not so well approve of the mode proposed by the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, nor did he approve of referring this motion to the Committee of Finance, who had already enough upon their hands; considerable time must therefore elapse before any return could be made by them, or else other things which they had in hand must be neglected. He wished a committee to be appointed for the express purpose of carrying into execution the object of this motion. He was not sanguine enough to suppose that any curtailing of pensions would cause any diminution of the public burdens, as they are felt by individuals; for when 50 millions a-year were required to be raised, even supposing &#x00A3;50,000 a year could possibly be diminished from the pension list, no remedy could thereby be afforded to the burdens of the individual; but the public, if encouraged to hope for this, would reap the advantage of those schemes for the national advantage, so necessary in the present posture of affairs. He had the authority of Judge Blackstone to say, that it was the duty of the house to inquire into the amount and circumstances of the pensions granted by the crown; and he considered that it was also competent to the house to inquire into the specific grants, as well as the number of sinecure places and reversions. He denied the position, that the man who had a reversionary interest in a place, had a sort of freehold in which the public had no interest. If there existed certain patent places which originally were for small sums, but had now grown into enormous ones, and these held by persons who could have no claim to such places, in his opinion the continuance of them formed proper subject of inquiry by parliament. If the salary of a person who held an official situation under government was not sufficient, he would willingly increase it, for he thought there should be no monopoly of important offices to a wealthy aristocracy, otherwise no man could accept an office, who had not a handsome fortune of his own. He thought it was a mischievous practice to
<col>752</col>
grant pensions to persons after holding offices for a short time. It was no good plea for the person retiring on such pension to say, that he had been induced to take the office against his will, and had abandoned more lucrative situations.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce </member>, <membercontribution>after adverting to the integrity and independence of his hon. friend (Mr. Bankes), expressed his regret, that he should have said any thing on the present occasion, which might have the appearance of a desire to prevent inquiry. It was highly gratifying to him, and must be so to the noble lord (Cochrane), to see that his motion was received with general approbation, and that there appeared to be scarcely any difference, except as to the form. He thought the mode proposed by the chancellor of the exchequer the most proper, but differed from him as to the grants by the crown, which might be examined, though not malignantly nor invidiously. With regard to the salaries of public men, he thought that here, too, a prudent parsimony ought to prevail, for it ought to be considered that they were paid not only by their salaries, but by the distinction they enjoyed, and the opportunity of transmitting their names to posterity as faithful and able servants of the public. Yet he thought that they ought to have pensions upon retirement, upon the same principle, that officers in the army and navy had halt-pay. He was convinced that nothing was better calculated than openness and fair dealing, to make public Men and parliament stand well in public opinion, and he was glad that this motion had been made, as it would tend to secure that object. But there was a danger of hunting too eagerly after popularity. The circumstance that rendered popular governments more capable of great exertions than others, was the affection of the people to their institutions, and their consequent willingness to bear the public burthens. It was, therefore, of the last importance that the house of commons should stand well with the considerate part of the community, particularly with the middle classes, which formed the most valuable part of it. If an idea had gone forth that there was a great deal of corruption in that house, it was desirable that the public should be satisfied that there, was a great deal more independence in it than was imagined. This motion came rather suddenly, and he was desirous to adjourn the debate fur two or three days, to consider about the most proper mode of attaining the object in view (a cry of no, no!). He doubted whether it ought to be referred
<image src="S1V0009P0I0391"/>
<col>737*</col>
to the Committee of Finance or to a separate Committee. The Committee of Finance had certainly a great deal of business already, and would probably bring sums into the public service that were at present lost to the state. But the point deserved consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the noble lord very wisely had not prefaced his motion with much argument, because, if he comprehended him rightly, his object was not so much to diminish the public expenditure, as to ascertain the degree of influence which the crown possessed in that house. As to the mode proposed by the right hon gent., it appeared to him to be a most round about way to go into the general investigation of the subject, to obtain a list of all the places, pensions, &amp;c. enjoyed by different individuals, and from that list to select the names of the members of that house who participated in them. Why not the individual list called for by the noble lord? Every gentleman seemed to be tender upon this subject; but the only way to convince the public that its suspicions were unfounded, was not to mask the matter, but to shew at once what part of the house received these emoluments, and what part did not. In his opinion it was much better that government should expend fifty, aye, a hundred and fifty millions of money annually in the general service of the country, than that they should expend 50,000l. in the house of commons. He objected to any alteration in the noble lord's motion. If the result of the production of the list, for which the noble lord had moved, should be to astonish those who were not disposed to think very favourably of the house of commons, it would be most fortunate; but if, on the contrary, it should be found that there was an incredible number of members who either directly or indirectly derived advantages from sources not the most pure, that was a fact which ought to be known to the people. At any rate let not the question be blinked.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson </member>, <membercontribution>adverting to some observations made in an early stage of the debate, wished to set himself right with the house. While now in place, he did not enjoy the pension which had been granted to him on his formerly quitting office.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Calcraft</member> <membercontribution>said he would not trouble the house long. The noble lord's proposition was, that a list of the members who were directly or indirectly under the influence of ministers, should be laid on the table. If there were persons who had their patrimony out of the public money, it was
<col>738*</col>
proper that they should be known. There were some who could not have their marriage settlements without pensions, reversions, &amp;c. &amp;c. The hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Huskisson), had a grant, which, from its nature, ceased when he came into office. This was only 1000l. and his office brought him 4000l. he could not therefore hesitate in his choice between them. But, if he was not mistaken, the hon. gent. had a sinecure place too, which he enjoyed along with the office, and indeed, in casting his eye along the Treasury Bench, it was difficult to find one who had not some great emolument of this nature. It ought to be seen on which side of the house the greatest portion of independence existed, and the list ought to be laid on the table unmixed with baser matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. George Rose </member>, <membercontribution>with great warmth, said, that the extent of his rewards for public services were well known to the public. He challenged inquiry, and wished that the terms of the present motion might be rendered as satisfactory as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>then proposed as an amendment; that a committee should be appointed to investigate the subject, and that it should be an instruction to the committee to examine into all places, pensions, &amp;c. in the words of the original motion, except into commissions and appointments in the army and navy, and into places in the revenue, not exceeding, &#x00A3;200 a year in value.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Cochrane</member> <membercontribution>replied shortly to the arguments that had been urged. His motive was not the expectation of great national saving, but because a general feeling existed in the country of the corruption of the house of commons. As to commissions in the army and navy, he knew that the latter had been given for votes in that house; and it had been found by some, that the best way to obtain preferment was, to buy a house or two in a contested borough: for his part, he was actuated only by a desire to serve his country. The assent to his motion would tend to establish ministers in their situations; for, though they should secure all the votes in the house, they could not keep their places long against the current of public opinion, which would set against them if they negatived it. The Committee of Finance, had sufficient business already. If, after the committee for which he moved should have made their report as to the members, it should be thought desireable to have an alphabetical list of all places, pensions, &amp;c. he should have no objection. It would be an
<image src="S1V0009P0I0392"/>
<col>739*</col>
object of great curiosity. He thought that the subject should be gravely considered in parliament. He was of opinion, that many would be ashamed of these practices if they were exposed to public view, and therefore he was anxious to give them publicity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>declared, that as the noble lord did not wish to depart from his original motion, he would certainly support him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member> <membercontribution>expressed great satisfaction to find, that whatever difference of opinion existed in that house with regard to the form of the motion, there was but one opinion as to the propriety of giving information to the public upon a subject of such vital importance. This general concurrence of sentiment would make a most favourable impression upon the public mind. He objected to referring the matter to the committee of finance, and would vote for the original motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the house by referring this matter to the committee, would not interfere with its functions, because the committee would only have to issue their precept for the returns to the public offices, and to lay these returns before the house. He objected to that part of the noble lord's statement which asserted, that officers in the army and navy acquired promotion by their seats in that house. This charge appeared to have been made lightly, and the best refutation of it would be to refer the noble lord to a comparison between the naval officers who had seats in that house, and those who had gloriously earned their seats in the other house, and he was sure the noble lord would then be convinced, that there was no reason to complain upon this head.&#x2014;The question being loudly called for, the house divided; For the Original "Motion, 61. Against it, 90. Majority 29.

When strangers were re-admitted to the gallery, we found the chancellor of the exchequer upon his legs; who, after some prefatory observations, concluded by moving, "That it be an instruction to the committee of finance, to inquire into the nature of all pensions, places, sinecures, and salaries, arising from the public revenues, and to ascertain the names of the persons so receiving, with the exception of officers holding commissions in the army and navy, and of all the collectors of taxes and revenue, whose salaries do not exceed &#x00A3;200 a year."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. N. Calvert</member> <membercontribution>disapproved of these instructions, as calculated to restrict the exertions of the committee of finance. Circumstances might occur in the course of their investigations, which might render the instructions proposed an impediment to those pursuits for which that committee was appointed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Cochrane</member> <membercontribution>proposed as an amendment, that the inquiry of the committee of finance should be forthwith, and that it should be limited to the places and sinecures at present held by members of that house and their immediate friends.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>thought an order of the house to every public office to produce the lists in question, would do better than adopting the motion as it now stood. He hoped the motion would be so worded as to instruct the committee immediately to proceed in the inquiry in question, or that it would be withdrawn, and the papers be called for by an order of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said he had already stated, that he at first thought of this mode of proceeding; but it afterwards occurred to him that the committee might be able to direct the attention of the house to something in the accounts which might escape his observation. He could not forbear observing how unfortunate he had been, after having adopted the suggestion of the hon. gent. (Mr. Whitbread) that that gent. should have abandoned his own opinion the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0393"/>
<col>741*</col>
moment he (Mr. P.) thought of acting on it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, in answer to the allusion to his conduct, that concurring as he did in principle with the noble lord who had brought forward the motion, and differing from him only as to the mode of proceeding, he submitted the suggestion which he had thrown out to the noble lord, and not to the right hon. gent. The right hon gent. had indeed fallen in with his (Mr. W's) suggestion as to form; but it did not from thence follow, that he must agree in the motion of the right hon. gent. to the principle of which he objected. He thought the right hon. gent. would better consult the feelings of the public by agreeing to the original motion. He hoped at least the right hon. gent. would allow his motion to be so altered, as that the committee should be instructed to proceed forthwith, and that they should also in their report distinguish those sinecures, &amp;c. which were held by members of that house, so that the noble lord's motion might not be entirely evaded. The noble lord unquestionably meant that there should be exhibited during the present session of parliament a list of all the members of that house holding sinecure offices, places, &amp;c. under government, and in that way liable to have their conduct influenced. If such a return was not made the house would disgrace itself. Those who respected the house at present would suspect that all was not right, and those who already suspected them would have their suspicions confirmed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bankes</member> <membercontribution>wished that the accounts might be ordered to be laid before the house, that the committee might not fall into disgrace. It was impossible they could report this session, and it was equally impossible to say how early they might be able to do so in the next. If the returns were to be made to the house, no time would be lost in completing them, and then if it was thought the committee could be of service, it would be time enough to refer the papers to them. It would be but doing them slender justice, to allow the delay which might take place in making the returns to seem to attach to the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>thought it impossible, after what had fallen front the chairman of the committee of finance (Mr. Bankes), that the chancellor of the exchequer could persevere in his motion, or if he did so, that the house would support him in it. It was nothing but an evasion of the noble lord's motion. Its object was to see how many members of
<col>742*</col>
this house were possessed of sinecure places, pensions, &amp;c. and of course might be supposed to be under the influence of the crown. The motion of the chancellor of the exchequer, however, went to exhibit a list of all persons whatever having any place, pension, &amp;c. This was to overwhelm the inquiry, and to strangle and suffocate the object which the noble lord had in view.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>was surprised at the great change Which had so lately taken place in the language of gentlemen on the other side. Lately they confessed that there was little or no difference in the object which seemed to be in view by all parties, and that the form was the only obstruction to unanimity. Now they had all at once discovered, that the motion of his right hon. friend the chancellor of the exchequer, was calculated only to evade and defeat the object which the noble lord had in view. He contended that the motion of the chancellor of the exchequer was completely adapted not only to the object sought to be gained, but that the evidence to be obtained by it might also be of importance in other respects.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>lamented to see gentlemen who talked so much of their independence, and prided themselves on that circumstance, so entirely forget in what it consisted as to lend their countenance to a deception on the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>supported the motion, maintaining that all the places, pensions, &amp;c. were already well known, and that sinecures were not now so numerous as they had been.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Calcraft</member> <membercontribution>observed, that such a list as that now spoken of, might, if any person Were to give himself the trouble to do so, be collected from papers that were already on the table of that house. The object of the motion he conceived to be simply this, to bring fairly before the house in one point of view the names of all the members of that house, who either held places or enjoyed pensions, or else whose wives or children derived a similar emolument from the crown. He could not avoid remarking, by the way, the great activity of the member for Yorkshire (Mr. Wilberforce) in interposing with his shield in behalf of those who were in that situation. With regard to the right hon. gentlemen on the Treasury bench, he might certainly find some room to compliment them on their ingenuity upon this occasion; but he was certain that they had not left him the smallest opportunity to compliment them on a much more solid qualification&#x2014;their sincerity.&#x2014;The house then divided, when
<image src="S1V0009P0I0394"/>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-07-08">Wednesday, July 8.</date>
<p><member>[EAST INDIA COMPANY'S BONDS.] Mr. Grant</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition from the Directors of the East India Company, praying for leave to bring in a bill to raise an additional sum on bonds, until the increase of their capital authorised by parliament took place. On his moving that the petition be referred to a committee of the whole house,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Creevey</member> <membercontribution>rose and declared, that this was the first instance in which any public body had made such a request to parliament, without the production of the necessary documents on which it was founded. In 1772, an attempt was made by the ministry of the day to bring in a similar bill, but this attempt was defeated by general Burgoyne, who contended that an explicit account of the reasons which called for such a measure, ought first to be laid before the house. He trusted that the house would pursue a similar mode of conduct in the present instance, and that a complete disclosure of the state of the company's affairs would now take place; especially when it was recollected, that there were two India budgets in arrear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the hon. gent. was under a mistake in this business, and that the precedent of 1772, adduced by him, was not in point. The East India Company only wanted to raise by bond what they had been already authorised to raise in capital. With respect to the state of their affairs, that might be discussed in the committee of the whole house, to which his hon. friend had moved that the petition should be referred. As to the budget, it was his intention to-morrow to move for the papers which ought long ago to have been on the table of the house, and which it was not his fault were not so.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Peter Moore</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the company were precluded, under two acts of parliament, from extending their debt beyond a certain sum. An act, of 1793, bound them to extend it no farther than 1,500,000l: but an act of the very next year allowed them to increase it to 3,000,000l. That debt remained to this hour undiminished; and the act of parliament was as imperative against their extending their debt now, by the issue of bonds, as by any other mode. It was for the house to consider how far it was wise to extend the existing
<col>744*</col>
limitation; but certainly it ought not to be done without a full investigation of the company's affairs.&#x2014;The petition was then referred to a committee of the whole house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES&#x2014;MR. GALWAY MILLS.] Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>brought up the report of the Committee of Privileges, to Whom the letter addressed by George Galway Mills, esq. to the Speaker of the house of commons, and the petitions presented against the said G. G. Mills, esq. had been referred. The report stated, that the committee had examined and found that the said G. G. Mills, esq. was a member of the house of commons, and that he was then in the custody of the marshal of the King's Bench. The committee had consulted precedents, and had abstained from examining the allegations contained in the petitions which had been referred to them, conceiving that even had these allegations been proved, that would not have influenced their judgment, or prevented them from coming to the resolution which they had adopted, namely, that the said G. G. Mills, esq. was entitled to the privileges of parliament. He then moved that the house do agree with the committee in that resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. P. Moore </member>, <membercontribution>as a member of the committee, and as having himself presented a petition to the house against Mr. Mills, stated a few points, which in his opinion, the house, duly regarding its own honour and dignity, circumstances much more important than the privileges of an individual, ought deliberately to consider. The petition to which he alluded had been presented by him with the concurrence of the person against whom it was directed, and for whose interests he and others had exerted their utmost efforts; those efforts had been fruitless; because that hon. gent. did not chuse to abide by his own propositions. Mr. Mills's debts, of various descriptions, exceeded &#x00A3;30,000. Not one of his creditors wished to interfere with the privileges of parliament; but they thought, and certainly they were justified in thinking, that while the house of commons attended to the preservation of their privileges, they should also attend to the demands of justice, and to the preservation of their credit with the public. As far as time would allow, the committee had examined all the precedents which appeared to bear upon the present subject, but in his opinion, not one was found that met the case stated in the petitions. The petitions contained this allega-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0395"/>
<col>745*</col>
tion, that the petitioner had obtained his seat in parliament as a temporary protection, in order to evade the demands of his creditors, and ultimately, he was compelled to say so, to defraud them. He was sorry to be obliged to use such language when speaking of one with whom he had been in the habits of intimacy; but in a case so glaring, which so strongly excited the public attention, in times like these, it would be well for the house to pause before they granted to any man under such circumstances, the benefit of the privilege by which the ends of public justice would be defeated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. C. Wynne</member> <membercontribution>agreed most cordially to the report of the committee. The house was bound to support their privileges, which were given to them, not for their advantage, but for that of the country at large. The privileges which members of parliament enjoyed of freedom from arrest, was as good for the electors as for the elected; were it not so, many of the former might be unrepresented. There was not a single instance on the Journals of the house, refusing the privilege when clearly defined.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>thought that a special report ought to have been made by the committee on an inspection of the petitions which contained so strong a charge on the character of one of the members of that house: they stated that he had procured a seat in that house for the express purpose of enabling him to evade the payment of his debts and to escape to the West Indies. He understood that four or five persons now in the King's Bench were anxiously waiting the decision of the house, in order that if that decision were favourable to Mr. Mills, they might avail themselves of his example, and take similar steps in order to relieve themselves from similar embarrassments. He entreated the house, for their credit's sake, before they ordered liberation of this gentleman, either to refer the petitions back to the committee, or to take the subject into their grave and serious consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ellison</member> <membercontribution>declared, that the committee had entered upon this subject with feelings as allied to the foulness of the case, as could possibly be entertained. If the allegations of the petitions were proved against Mr. Mills, he thought that no hon. member ought to sit in the house with him; but he also thought, that, circumstanced as they were, the committee could do no more than they had done. Although he was of opinion that it would be better to consider this subject
<col>746*</col>
generally, yet if it was deemed adviseable to take it up particularly, he would go as far as any man to rescue the house from the imputations that might otherwise be cast upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>deprecated any interference with the privileges of the house on this single case. If it could be proved that Mr. Mills had procured his election for fraudulent purposes, that would be a fit subject for the consideration of an election committee. He thought that Mr. Mills had been rather hardly treated, in having such grave accusations urged against him in his absence, when he was unable to reply to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>declared, that it was impossible not to approve the conduct of the committee, in refraining from entering into the allegations of the petitions. Mr. Mills's letter had been referred to them to ascertain the facts which it contained, and not to consider the law dependant on those facts which had never been questioned. Even had such a special report been made, as was wished for by an hon. gent.., and had the allegations been found proved, still the house must have granted the privilege. What the law was, and what it ought to be on revision, were too very different considerations. On this subject he would at present say, that it would require some very strong arguments to induce him to believe that the public convenience and advantage would be promoted by the abandonment of this privilege of parliament, although he was aware that in some cases it was productive of private injury. Neither could he agree with the hon. gent. (Mr. Barham) that, if it could be proved that an election was procured for fraudulent purposes, such election must become void. If the charge against Mr. Mills, with the aggravating circumstances attending, could be substantiated (which, in justice to that gentleman, he must remark had not hitherto been done), it might amount to a question of expulsion; but even in that case, it would be proper that the accused should be within the walls to defend himself and his seat.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Herbert</member> <membercontribution>spoke on the same side. He said the privileges of the house were the privileges of the people. Some of the most illustrious members of that house had been known to be in very poor circumstances; and if it were not for this privilege of freedom from arrest in civil suits, it would be in the power of any administration, by buying up the debts of a person who was so unfortunate as to be in that predicament, to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0396"/>
<col>747*</col>
immure any man of the first rate talents, and deprive the country of his abilities in that house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>observed that this was not a law, but a privilege of parliament, which it might dispense with or not, as it thought proper. Therefore, though the house should give it up in this case, it by no means followed that it must do so in other cases. If fraud was proved, the guilty person ought not to be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong. The committee were perfectly right in their report, but it was for the house to consider allegations. These, indeed, were not proved, but there was a prayer in the petitions for permission to prove them. The privileges of the house existed only for the benefit of the public, and rested on no other foundation. The only question, therefore, was, whether a greater general mischief would result from giving up this privilege in particular instances, than from maintaining it in its full extent.&#x2014;The motion for agreeing with the committee in their resolution was then carried, as was also a motion by Mr. Rose, that the said G. G. Mills, esq. be discharged out of the custody of the Marshal of the King's Bench.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SIR H. MILDMAY'S MEMORIAL.]&#x2014;Sir H. Mildmay</member> <membercontribution>rose pursuant to notice, to move that there be laid before the house a Supplement to his Memorial which was already upon the table. He took that occasion to state that he owed considerable acknowledgments to lord Sidmouth's government, for the fairness and liberality which he had experienced from it. His first offer had been made to the Barrack Office during that administration, but the whole of the business respecting the letting of his house, had taken place after that administration had gone out of office. His principal object in rising had been to move that there be laid before the house, certain letters which he had received from some individual of the Jury, that had awarded him the compensation for the injury his property had sustained. Of the whole of those who composed the Jury, he was not acquainted with the addresses of more than four, one of whom was the foreman. They were amongst the most respectable persons in the county. The hon. baronet then read extracts from these letters, which explicitly stated, that the 16 acres, with the house, were not included in the estimate of compensation; that the award did not preclude the hon. baronet from residing in, or disposing of the house; that of the 1300l. awarded by the
<col>748*</col>
Jury, 700l. was for the injury done to the ground by the works, and to defray the expence of restoring it to the state in which it was before the construction of the works; and that the Jury were aware at the time of making their award, of his being in treaty with government for the house. And here he begged to call the attention of the house to the situation in which he stood, with respect to this transaction. In June next he should be obliged to return to that house, with a barrack within half a-mile of it on one side and on the other. The sums he had received as compensation for a house that had cost 70,000l. to build, were very inconsiderable, though that house had been destroyed, at least as a residence for his family. If he had been upon the Jury, he had no difficulty in saying, that he should have awarded considerably more than had been awarded to him. However, whether the Jury had awarded him 50l. or 500l. he thought himself equally bound to abide by their judgment. He only wished that the house should be able fully to judge of his conduct in the Whole of this transaction, and with that view he moved, that the letters he alluded to, should be laid before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the production of this paper, and he hoped it would prove as satisfactory as the statement just made by the hon. baronet, though he lamented that it did not appear to him yet as satisfactory as could be desired. There seemed to be some strange mistake in the case, because the hon. baronet had stated in his examination before the committee, that the 400l. a year was to procure him another residence; and now it was said to have been granted, on the general ground of enabling him to restore the land from the injury done by the works. If the sum had been awarded for the rent, it would have been an exorbitant allowance to make an award at the rate of 20l. per acre; and if for the land, the whole of the compensation ought to go to the tenants. But the hon. baronet in his examination had stated, that the 4001. per annum was to provide another residence for him; in this view, therefore, the statement did not appear to him to be satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>was surprised at so complete a misunderstanding in so plain a point. The fault he found with his hon. friend, was, that he had carried his delicacy too far in the steps he had taken to justify himself; unless it could be made out that he had had a corrupt understanding with the Jury, he was not more responsible for their
<image src="S1V0009P0I0397"/>
<col>749*</col>
award than any member of that house. The answer of the hon. baronet to the commissioners was one which he was not bound to give, nor the commissioners authorised to ask, because it was not for him to account for the award of the Jury. The 700l. were awarded to his hon. friend to replace the land in the state in which it was, previous to the construction of the works. But the noble lord forgot that his hon. friend could not get back into possession of his premises, till government should give up the lease.&#x2014;The question was then put and agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SALE OF COMMISSIONS IN THE ARMY.] Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member>, <membercontribution>in pursuance of his notice, rose to move, "that there be laid before the house, an account of all sums of money that had been received for the Sale of Commissions, which at any time became vacant by death, dismission, or in consequence of the promotion of officers, who were not allowed to sell out, from the year 1795 to the present time, specifying the names of the persons by whom paid and received, and the uses to which those sums were from time to time applied, together with receipts which had been given for the same."<lb/>
The Secretary at War said, that although he had no objection to the substance of the motion, it must universally be allowed, that the sole disposal of commissions in the army was vested in his majesty, and he doubted whether it were quite proper for the house to inquire into the exercise of this prerogative; however, as he knew that the illustrious Commander in Chief was exceedingly desirous to give every information on this business, he should not object to the substance of the motion now made. The mode was for military commissions to be presented to his majesty, upon which his majesty's pleasure was taken, as to filling them up. The purposes for which any commissions were sold, were two-fold, and which shewed that the illustrious commander in chief both studied public economy and the private advantage of individuals, and that at the expence of his own private patronage. The first object in the sale of commissions was for the half-pay fund; and, secondly, for the relief of families of meritorious officers, who might fall in the service of their country. He particularly instanced the case of colonel Vassal's widow. The bulk of commissions was generally by purchase, particularly in time of peace; in time of war there generally remained a number of Vacant appointments, for which no purchasers were to be
<col>750*</col>
found. At the conclusion of the late war there were a number of vacancies for which no ensigns were to be found. It had been proposed to lieutenants upon half-pay to serve on the pay of effective ensigns, and that ensigns' places should be sold. The price of 300l. was fixed for the sale of such commissions; but if every commission had been sold as it became vacant, it would have proved injurious to many officer. The commander in chief, therefore, suffered promotion in many instances to go on in a regular course; but still, from time to time, commissions were sold, and the money was vested in the half-pay fund. Another source from which this fund received support, was, when an officer wished to quit the army, he was allowed to sell what he had purchased, although not to sell the rank which he already possessed; thus, the difference between the price of an ensigncy and of a majority went to the same fund. The illustrious person at the head of the army had done much for its benefit; for formerly great abuses had crept into the purchase and sale of commissions. In the year 1793, officers had been advanced from the lowest ranks of the army up as high as that of lieutenant-colonel. This system had been put a stop to, and a salutary regulation had been established, that an officer, under two years standing, could not be made a captain; nor a field officer under six years standing. The practice of giving exorbitant prices for commissions, the effect of which tended to the deterioration of the army, had also been checked by the commander in chief. From what he had stated, he thought an address the most proper mode of proceeding, and therefore concluded by moving an amendment to that effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>had no objection whatever to shape his motion in that form. He could assure the house, that in bringing it forward he had no other than a public object. He had never entertained the smallest suspicion, nor given the least credit to the malicious and unfounded reports which had been in circulation, against the illustrious personage at the head of the army. But he thought it his duty, as a representative of the people, to watch over the expenditure of the public money, and he looked upon these sums to be public money. The account he was persuaded ought to be laid annually before the house, especially if, as he understood, the sums received amounted to one million.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-07-09">Thursday, July 9.</date>
<p><member>[IRISH INSURRECTION BILL.]&#x2014;Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>rose to move for leave to bring in a bill, for the suppression of Insurrection in Ireland, and to prevent the disturbance of the peace in that country. The house would remember, that the circumstances which preceded and attended the suppression of the rebellion in Ireland, had rendered stronger measures than the established laws afforded necessary in that country. An act was therefore passed by the Irish parliament, in 1796, to prevent unlawful assemblies, and to authorise the lord lieutenant on a report of the magistrates to proclaim any county where disturbances existed. That law required all persons in such counties to keep within their dwellings between the hours of sun set and sun rise, and gave to the magistrates the power of sending persons who should be found to offend against it on board his majesty's navy. The act had proved effectual for the suppression of the insurrection, as appeared from the acknowledgement of the leaders of that insurrection before a committee of the Irish parliament. But, though such a law might be necessary, it was the duty of that house to guard against the abuse of the powers which it gave. The bill he proposed to bring in contained the same provisions as the Insurrection act, with respect to the power of the lord lieutenant to proclaim disturbed counties, and the authority of the magistrates to arrest persons who should be found out of their dwellings between sun setting and sun rising; but, in order to prevent hardships to the subjects, the bill required that persons so arrested should be tried at the quarter sessions, by the magistrates and assistant barrister, assisted by a king's counsel, a serjeant specially sent down for that purpose. Besides this bill, he meant to move for leave to bring in another to prevent improper persons from keeping arms, by obliging all persons to register their arms, and authorising the magistrates to search for arms. These bills had been prepared by his predecessor, and the only difference was, that the bill of his predecessor gave a negative to the king's counsel or serjeant, which he proposed to take from him, as it appeared to him that such a negative would render the measure nugatory. He meant, however, to substitute a clause, which should, in case of any difference between the serjeant and the bench, suspend the execution of the decision of the magistrates, till the serjeant should
<col>752*</col>
have reported the matter to the lord lieutenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>wished to know what was to be the duration of the bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>proposed 7 years, but his mind was not yet made up on that head.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>had asked the question, because he thought that the shortest possible duration should be given to bills which created such extraordinary powers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>agreed with the hon. bart. that 7 years would be too long a period, for which to enact the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>was concerned that a bill of that nature should be necessary. But this and every other such bill was a violent measure, and against the principles of the constitution. The period of such measures ought to be short, in order to shew to the people that they had at least a reversionary interest in the constitution. These measures could only be justified by an imperious necessity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>viewed this question in a very different light from his friends on the bench near him. His right hon. friend had said, that the measure could only be justified by an imperious necessity; now, it was that necessity which he wished to have clearly made out to exist before the measure was resorted to. It was no answer to him that the measure had been prepared by his friends. If it had, the Threshers were then engaged in their disturbances and administering unlawful oaths. Ireland was now on the contrary as loyally tranquil as any part of the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>thought that the measure had never been, and ought not to be, enacted for so long a period as 7 years. He found himself in different circumstances from his right hon. friend as to the measure; for he must look upon it as necessary, inasmuch as the committee of both lords and commons on both sides had agreed upon that point.&#x2014;Leave was then given to bring in the bill, as also a bill to prevent improper persons from having arms in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

He was desirous of knowing, whether it was the intention of his majesty's government to pro-

pose, during this session of parliament, any measure connected with the Defence of the Country. He had it in view to call their lordships? attention to this subject, independent of any reference to recent events; but the information which had just been received, rendered its consideration more indispensible. It was his wish to be informed, whether his majesty's ministers intended to carry into full execution the acts already passed for arming the people, or whether they had some more extensive measure in contemplation? He understood there would be a full attendance of their lordships on Monday next, and he should take that opportunity of asking the question he had just mentioned.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>said, that the noble lord alluded to had not attended for these two days past, because he knew there was no business before the house which required his presence.

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>&#x2014;Petitions were presented complaining of undue returns for Chippenham, Kincardineshire, Malden, Penryn, Beverley, Malmsbury, East Grinstead, Bridgewater, Christchurch, Newcastle-under-Lyne, and Westminster. The Petition respecting the latter was from the right hon. R. B. Sheridan, complaining of b<ob/>ibery treating, &amp;c. on the part of lord Cochrane. The whole of these petitions were appointed to be taken into consideration, on the 25th instant.&#x2014; Mr. Sheridan, though he thought it a matter worthy of the consideration of the house, to put the Standing Order relative to the exclusion of Strangers on some established footing, yet, in deference to the sentiments of many persons, for whose opinions he had a high respect, would not press the motion he intended to have offered to the house this night, but would leave the matter as it stood, hoping that a wise discretion would produce all the effect of the proposition he intended to bring forward.&#x2014;Mr. Grant moved, that the house should go into a committee on the Petition of the East India Company praying for leave to raise money on Bonds, instead of increasing their capital. Mr. Creevey repeated his former assertion, that a previous statement of the company's affairs ought to have been made; but as some information would probably soon be acquired on the sub
<col>754</col>
ject, he would not object to the motion. The Speaker then left the chair. After a few words from Mr. R. Dundas, Mr. W. Smith, sir T. Turton, Mr Wallace, and sir A Wellesley, Mr. Grant moved that leave be given to bring in a bill to enable the company to raise 2 millions by Bonds, instead of encreasing their stock. This resolution was agreed to.&#x2014;Mr. Sharpe adverting to the circumstance of the chancellor of the exchequer having put off his motion respecting the Lottery, stated that it was not his intention to oppose that measure, as a part of the ways and means of the present year, but gave notice, that he should take an early opportunity of taking the sense of the house on the general question respecting Lotteries.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[NAVAL ABUSES ]&#x2014;Lord Cochrane</member> <membercontribution>rose and spoke as follows:&#x2014; Sir; A wish to avert a part of the impending and hitherto accumulating dangers of my country, has induced me to resolve to move for certain papers relative to the naval service, not with a retrospective view to blame individuals, but that unnecessary hardships may cease to exist.&#x2014;I am willing, sir, to believe that members of this house who are capable of doing justice to any cause, have remained ignorant of circumstances which for some years have embittered the lives of a portion of the community, I mean those employed in the naval service of their country; and as to the gentlemen of the naval profession who have seats here, I suppose they either left the service before the establishment of the system of which all employed grievously complain; or, that a degree of diffidence occasioned by the awe which this house at first inspires, has prevented any other from performing this important duty. I wish, sir, it had fallen into other hands. I lament that the means by which I have acquired a knowledge of the subject, has in a great measure, unfitted me for the task I have now undertaken but no personal considerations shall prevent my doing that which I consider for the benefit of my country. I shall be as brief as possible, but as the nature of some of the papers for which I am about to move is unknown to many members of this house, it will be necessary that I should give some explanation.&#x2014; The first motion is, "That there be laid before this house, copies of all letters or representations made by the commanders of his majesty's sloop Atalante, and schooner Felix, received by capt. Keats, commanding officer off Rochfort, respecting the state and condition of those vessels and
<image src="S1V0009P0I0400"/>
<col>755</col>
the sick therein." The object of this motion is to prove that vessels are kept at sea under the present system in an unfit and dangerous state, and that the lives of many officers and men are in constant peril.&#x2014;Lieut. Cameron who commanded the Felix, and since lost in that vessel, was one of the best and ablest officers I ever knew&#x2014;correct in all respects. He, sir, though just appointed to command the Felix, and anxious to distinguish himself, found it incumbent upon him to represent to the commanding officer the necessity of the Felix being sent into port for repair. I shall read part of two letters from the surgeon of the Felix to his private friend. One of them dated three months before they all perished, and previous to lieut. Cameron's commanding that vessel. The other about eight days before that melancholy event.&#x2014;Although, Mr. Speaker, these letters may not amount to legal proof, yet the official letters and other documents will. But, sir, it cannot appear that this unfortunate officer could have any interest in mistating matters to a private acquaintance. On the 14th Nov. he says, "our noble commander has been very active in his endeavours to get confirmed to this vessel, much more so than I should be&#x2014;she sails worse and worse, and I think the chances are against us ever bringing her into an English port." In the other, dated 14th January, 1807, the passage to which I refer is as follows: "Our stock is all out, and we are praying for some God-sends. Clean linen are very scarce. Every endeavour has been put in force by Cameron and myself to get her in without success. He attacked the commodore with most miserable epistles of distress throughout, and I attacked him with a very formidable sick list; but all, my friend, would not do."&#x2014;I may be told, that there is a danger in agitating such subjects, but there can be none at any time in bringing to the knowledge of the legislature, for redress, that which is notorious to those who have a right to claim it. Though we shut our eyes, the mischief will not be averted! Shall evils be suffered to continue, merely because timid people fear to acknowledge their existence? No, sir; let grievances be redressed in time, and complaints will cease.&#x2014;I shall be very short as to the circumstances relating to the other vessel, the Atalante. When the Imperieuse, the ship I commanded, was about to leave the Rochfort station, I was ordered to provision the Atalante for six weeks, though she had been out 8 months and upwards, a time sufficient
<col>756</col>
to break the energy, to weary the spirit, and ruin the health of men employed in such a vessel. The Atalante came alongside, and the commander and several officers were on board necessarily to settle their accounts; they then informed me of the bad condition of their sloop. They said she was wholly unfit to keep the sea. Several material spars were sprung, which in a gale of wind on shore would cause their inevitable loss. I think they said the foremast and bowsprit or fore yard were sprung. Besides, in blowing weather the Atalante made upwards of 20 inches of water an hour.&#x2014;Although a survey had been held by some carpenters previous to this, I thought it proper to mention circumstances as they had been reported, and as they appeared to me, to the commanding officer off Rochfort; for I well knew, that the minds of persons of their description under the system of terror, were impressed with fear lest a vessel surveyed having gone into port, might possibly be found not quite so bad as represented. Their usual plan, therefore, is, to say that she can keep the sea a while longer; knowing that if lost it will only be reckoned an excess of zeal on their part for the good of his majesty's service. So much impressed was I with the bad state of this vessel, that I said to the builder of Plymouth-yard, in the presence of Admiral Sutton, on my arrival there, that the first news we should have from off Rochfort, if they had a gale of wind there, would be the loss of the Atalante. Under the harrassing system of 8 and 9 months cruises men get tired of their lives, and even indifferent as to choice between a French prison and their present misery. I shall make no further observations on this subject until the papers are produced.&#x2014;Another paper that appears necessary, is an Abstract of the weekly accounts of his majesty's ships and frigates employed off Brest, and of ail his majesty's ships and vessels employed off Rochfort, from the 1st March, 1805, until the 1st March, 1807.&#x2014;From this, sir, we shall be able to ascertain the number of men in each vessel, the number of sick, the time ships have been kept at sea, and the time they have been allowed in harbour to refit the vessels, and to recruit the crews. First, it will appear that the ships have been greatly short of effective men. Next, the extreme length of cruises and hardships that our seamen have suffered, which the low state of the enemy's navy did not require, and which in its most flourishing times had never been put in practice, because well
<image src="S1V0009P0I0401"/>
<col>757</col>
known to be highly injurious. The Plantagenet, for instance, was 8 months within 4 hours sail of England; she was forced into Falmouth, and remained 12 days wind bound at one time; but an order existed, which I shall presently make the subject of a motion, by which neither an officer nor a man dared to stretch his legs even upon the gravel beach within 20 yards of the ship.&#x2014;As a subject connected with the foregoing, and to shew how little benefit has been derived from supplies at sea, as a substitute for the refreshments the crews were formerly suffered to enjoy in port, I shall next move,&#x2014;"That there be laid before this house an Account of the quantity of fresh provisions <i>expressed in days</i> allowance, received at sea by each of his majesty's ships and vessels employed off Brest and Rochfort, from the 1st March, 1805, to the 1st March, 1807."&#x2014; Formerly, Mr speaker, when a ship had been out till the provisions with which she had been supplied were consumed, the return of that vessel to port was the natural consequence. For Channel service the time was 4 months, and the officers and men with satisfied minds looked forward contemplating with pleasure the little relaxations and indulgences they might then enjoy. But now, sir, being victualled and re-victualled at sea, there is no probable end of their misery. An East India voyage is performed in less time and with more refreshments than a channel cruise. Capt. Cook, whose authority will not be treated lightly, says, that "notwithstanding the Discovery had been out 117 days, the scurvy had made no great progress, which he ascribes to the essence of malt and fermented liquors." Limo juice is now the substitute, and a cure it is&#x2014;but a debilitating cure &#x2014;not fit to re-establish the strength of body impaired by living without vegetables for a long period on salted provisions. How matters of such material consequence have escaped the notice of the latest admiralties, I am at a loss to know; unless an excess of confidence reposed in the late commander in chief of the channel fleet has been the cause; and that this security existed on the part Of the admiralty, I think will be proved by the paper to which the motion I hold in my hand refers: "That there be laid before this house such orders as have been issued or acted upon between the 1st March, 1805, and the 1st March, 1807, by the authority of the commanders in chief of his majesty's ships and vessels employed in the channel soundings, respecting leave
<col>758</col>
to be granted or withheld from officers or men; distinguishing who was commander in chief at the time of issuing or acting upon such orders."&#x2014;In harbour, too, that neither officer nor man shall be permitted to go on shore is a hard case, and an order which I do not hesitate to condemn. And, sir, it appears not less striking, when I recollect, that during the greatest part of the time the commander in chief resided in London, enjoying not only the salary of his office, but claiming the <i>emolument of prize money,</i> gained by the toil and danger to which those engaged in the active service and defence of their country are exposed.&#x2014; Such, indeed, sir, is the example shewn in this case, that I shall not be surprised to see some future minister confer the office on a fool or on a child, and make the situation of commander in chief of the channel fleet a sinecure as complete, and a means of corruption equal to any that has lately been the subject of debate in this house.&#x2014;With respect to the sick, I consider it necessary to say a few words; but I shall first read my motion on that subject: "That there be laid before this house such orders as have been issued or acted upon between the 1st March, 1805, and the 1st March, 1807, by or by the authority of the commander in chief of his majesty's ships, &amp;c. employed in the channel soundings, allowing or restraining commanding officers or surgeons of his majesty's ships, &amp;c. from sending men to the naval hospitals, or restricting their admission into such hospitals."&#x2014;In consequence of the regulations established in those institutions, mess were frequently refused admittance. A grievance connected with this point has made a strong impression upon my mind; that is, an order, rigidly inforced, that no man, whatever his state of health, be permitted to be sent to the hospital from any of the ships in the Channel Fleet, unless previously examined and allowed by the surgeon of the Commander in-Chief. The mischiefs resulting from this arrangement were notorious in the navy. In consequence of the inconvenience and difficulty, if not impossibility, of this surgeon's going from ship to ship at such times as vessels might be going into port, various diseases, deaths and amputations, too frequently ensued before such surgeon's examination could take place. There is another subject of complaint which appeared to me peculiarly ruinous. When the cry of &#x0153;conomy was the order of the day in the naval depa<ob/>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0402"/>
<col>759</col>
the house and the country must be surprized to hear of so singular an application of it as in limiting surgeons necessaries allowed to the navy. Some of the indispensible medicines, too, were cut off. The &#x0153;conomists of that day seemed to consider the health of men as a thing of trifling account, compared to their favourite principle. So pertinaciously were regulations observed, that although I once sent a lieutenant sick and a seaman ruptured to the Hospital, I could not obtain their admission. The disease of the one was pronounced quite inadmissible, and though sent through sleet and rain, the only day for nearly three weeks in which they could go ashore, they were returned refused, and the country would be astonished, if not indignant, to hear the reason why the man was not admitted, because every thing possible had not been done to reduce the rupture on board, and he had not been hung up by the heels in a rolling sea, in order to reduce the rupture.&#x2014;Why the evils connected with this system have not been before submitted to parliament and the public, I cannot pretend to say. Perhaps gentlemen may have been prevented from exposing it from motives of delicacy or personal interest; but no such considerations shall restrain me from the performance of a great public duty, to which, from its nature, I feel it peculiarly incumbent upon me to attend. The system of Naval Hospitals presents a variety of grounds to justify censure. In military hospitals, some little luxuries are allowed: to suit delicate stomachs, and to promote the revival of depressed spirits; and where can such luxuries be more necessary than to seamen, with diseased constitutions, after being eight or nine months living upon salt provisions, at sea. But in naval hospitals, no such luxuries are to be had; no eggs, no oranges are allowed. I know an instance, in which a lieutenant, who was dangerously ill, was refused a cup of egg wine. The answer was, that no eggs were allowed: the lieutenant died of his disease.&#x2014;But this regulation is maintained on the ground of economy: indeed, this economy has gone to such a length as to reduce the quantity of lint before allowed to the surgeons. In consequence of which, in many cases, there is not for the purpose of the wounded, one fourth part enough of this article, so material for use, although so trifling in value. This limitation took place under one of those who were appointed by the commander in chief of the channel fleet, whom perhaps it was not necessary for him otherwise to name [a cry of
<col>760</col>
name, name], by earl St. Vincent, observed the noble lord, these appointments were made&#x2014;and under his regulations the navy has endured the sufferings I have faintly described. Unworthy savings have been unworthily made. Though sheltered by the plea of economy, a greater loss has, I contend, resulted to this country, than can ever be compensated by any savings economy is capable to produce.&#x2014;I mean in the lives of men destroyed by long cruises and otherwise. Were it possible to consider the value of these lives in a pecuniary view, which I never can, it would require more money to supply the losses sustained by the application of economy in the manner I have described, than can be well imagined. Indeed, the grievances of the navy have been so severe, through rigour and misapplied economy, that I can see nothing in the character of that body more meritorious than the patience with which they have suffered those grievances.&#x2014;The noble lord concluded with making his first motion; which being seconded by the hon. Mr. Dillon.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Samuel Hood rose </member>, <membercontribution>and expressed his astonishment at the statements and observations which he had just heard; which really were such that he had hardly thought it possible that they could have come from so gallant an officer. If any thing of blame, said the hon. officer, attaches to the loss of the Atalante and the Felix, that blame is attributable to me and to commodore Keats. But the fact is, that the loss of the Atalante was not at all owing to her having been in a bad state. She drove ashore in a swell upon a fine day, and if she had not been sound, her crew could not have been saved. But the noble lord could not ascribe blame in consequence of this vessel's going ashore. For such an accident was no proof of neglect on the part of the officers. No censure could apply to them, any more than it could to the conduct of the noble lord himself, when he lost his ship some time since. A clear understanding of the case, therefore, was only necessary to refute this part of the noble lord's charges, and to shew that neither the officers nor any other person could be fairly blamed for the fate of the Atalante, for that fate was owing to an accident against which any commander, however vigilant, might be utterly unable to guard. Now, as to the Felix; that vessel perished in a gale of wind in St. Andero Bay, where she was sent with a flag of truce. She remained four days in the bay; and, had the soundest vessel in the navy been in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0403"/>
<col>761</col>
the same situation in a gale of wind, she would have very little chance, if any, of escaping a similar fate. Indeed, there was ample proof that the Felix was not in a bad state; but when she was in port, the lieutenant wanted to go ashore to settle his accounts, and was refused. There is the secret, and hence probably this charge. I do not mean to impute to the noble lord any disposition to state any thing which he does not himself strictly believe. But the noble lord may be, I know he has been, misinformed, and when he comes forward with such misinformation to breed discontent in the navy, I feel it my duty, as it is the duty of every man who respects the best interests of that body, to resist him.&#x2014;With regard to what the noble lord has said about provisions, and sickness, and medicines, I challenge him to prove any of his allegations. I. sailed from Plymouth, and when I recollect it, I cannot help laughing at the noble lord's statement. I had several men sick on board, but they recovered at sea. I had in one engagement 30 men killed and 100 wounded, and there was no such thing as a want of medicines or lint; nothing of the kind was to be heard of. I am fully of opinion, that none of the noble lord's assertions on this subject can be maintained. I have, I think, sufficiently replied to his statement relative to the Atalante and Felix; and I see no good to which any part of his statements can tend, though I can perceive in them very strong grounds to apprehend serious mischief.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Admiral Harvey</member> <membercontribution>followed on the same side. He deprecated the attempts made perpetually to harass a gallant meritorious old officer [a cry of hear! hear!] He had no hesitation in saying, that the grounds of attack appeared quite fallacious. For himself, he could confidently say, that he never saw any scarcity whatever of medicines, surgeons stores, or provisions, on board any ship that came under his observation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Admiral Markham</member> <membercontribution>never rose with more regret, because he did feel the utmost apprehension, that the effect of such a discussion as that provoked by the noble lord, would do material injury to the discipline of the navy. No redress had ever been applied for to the Admiralty upon any of the grounds stated by the noble lord; and in what condition, he would ask, was the navy to be placed, if an inferior officer could bring his commander in chief to the bar of that house. With respect to the time a ship ought to be at sea, that depended on
<col>762</col>
the necessity of the case, and not on the will of a commander in chief. But a good officer would not be forward to complain of such a thing. His hon. friend who spoke last was 13 months off Cape Finisterre, and his hon. friend who preceded him, was 5 months off Rochefort; yet neither were ever heard to complain. No; they knew their duty too well, and, like good officers, were reconciled to it. As to the injury to the health of the men, by keeping ships at sea, he would maintain that nothing was inure erroneous than the notion of the noble lord; for the fact was, that it always so happened, that seamen came ashore to get sick, and went to sea to get healthy. [A laugh, and cry of hear! hear!] As to the charge about fresh provisions, the hon. officer maintained, that nothing could be more untenable; for fresh provisions were sent to the fleet as often as they could be necessary, and in the best state that was practicable to convey them. With regard to surgeons stores, they were supplied under the administration of lord St. Vincent, precisely according to the plan originated either by lord Melville or lord Barham, he could not recollect which; and this was the first day he had ever heard it stated, that there was any scarcity whatever of those stores. If, however, such stores were wanted, why not apply to the executive government, and not bring it forward in that house? Unless such an application was found ineffectual, he contended that such a business ought not to be brought before that house.&#x2014;As to the order for having persons reviewed, by the surgeon of the commander in chief, before they were sent to the hospital, he explained that to be with a view to prevent men to he disposed of who were fit to serve. For while officers could send men to the hospital on the Mere certificate of their own surgeon, they, naturally anxious for a good crew, were too apt to make use of their influence with the surgeon, to send any man to the hospital whom they did not happen to like.&#x2014;The allusion to the residence of the commander in chief in London, could derive no influence but from delusion. He did so on account of his health. Besides the Channel Fleet was in different divisions, and the fact was, that for the purpose of communicating with each, the noble lord had better be ashore than at sea. Indeed, unless he took the station of junior admiral, he could not consistently join any of the divisions. For that noble earl he could only say, that he had no objection whatever to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0404"/>
<col>763</col>
the production of any paper or document that related to his conduct; but for himself, he must observe, that disliking the whole discussion, or the introduction of such a subject at all in that house, he could not assent to the noble lord's motion. If the noble lord had any good grounds of complaint, they should be referred to the admiralty, who would, no doubt, give them all the attention they deserved.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>declared, that no grounds whatever had been made out for the motion, which it was so seriously to be lamented that the noble lord had thought it his duty to bring forward. The house of commons would ever be anxiously alive to the welfare and interests of the brave men of whom our navy was composed; but he was convinced, that it would at the same time be very backward in adopting such motions as the present, unless the perion who proposed them could distinctly state that he had taken all other means of redressing the grievances complained of unsuccessfully.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>coincided completely in opinion with the right hon. gent. who had just sat down, and contended, that besides the just reasons for opposing the motion, which that right hon. gent. had stated, the noble lord had in no way whatever proved his assertions, but had been completely contradicted by the gallant admirals. He made an eloquent panegyric on earl St. Vincent, the history of whose whole life was a most brilliant answer to the accusations of his enemies.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Robert Ward</member> <membercontribution>observed that the highest encomiums were due to that illustrious character earl St. Vincent. Illustrious character he must call him, because whatever opinion might be entertained of his civil services, there could be no difference of sentiment as to the glory of his professional career. He admitted also the high professional character of the noble lord who made the motion; but he was sorry that such a motion had been brought forward in this house, before complaint had been made through the proper channel. No man could cherish more than he would the power and the right of this house to examine into abuses; but when there was a channel by which application ought to be made in the first instance, he thought it unnecessary and improper to bring complaints before this house, before any effort was made to have them corrected in the most natural and ready way.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Charles Pole</member> <membercontribution>in reply to the implied
<col>764</col>
censures of the noble lord upon the late administration of the navy, observed, that since the reign of king William no one had done so much for the navy as the late administration. The first act of the noble lord below (lord Howick), when he came into that department, was to examine into the state of the seamen; and he came down to the house for an increase of the number and the pay of the petty officers, thinking this one of the best methods of rewarding distinguished service among the men. All this he did gratuitously, without waiting for an application&#x2014;a measure which had not a little increased the confidence of the seamen in the government, an object in the highest degree desirable and advantageous. The noble lord had not stopped here. He also extended this beneficial measure to the Warrant Officers, without any application, a thing which had never been done since the days of king William. Neither did the noble lord stop here; he had followed the aged, the decrepid, wounded, and worn out seamen, to the obscurity of their cottages; chaced poverty and wretchedness from them, and diffused health, cheerfulness, and comfort. He had raised their allowance from 7 to 18l. a-year, and made seamen look with confidence towards the government which thus paid attention to their situation unasked. He had also followed up the measure, by an increase to the masters, lieutenants, and commanders. In short, every attention was paid by the noble lord to the interests of the service, a conduct which deserved the acknowledgements of all who wished well to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that he heard with regret and surprize, those assertions stated here, which he had heard on a former occasion; and he had thought from the manner in which the noble lord had at last dropped the accusations, that he had even convinced himself from the most authentic documents that he was wrong. He had read a letter from commodore Keats, taking the whole blame to himself, respecting some of the transactions, but where there was certainly no blame. And notwithstanding the boisterous manner in which the audience at the hustings at Covent Garden generally expressed their opinions, yet even they had rejected these clamours as dangerous, when they sufficiently understood their nature. They set their faces against them as out of time and place; as brought forward for manifest purposes, and not for the good of the public, and as attended with incalculable mischief, without being productive of any good. Sup-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0405"/>
<col>765</col>
pose he had not had the good fortune to be acquainted with the noble earl accused, whom he regarded with the highest respect and veneration; suppose he had not had the opportunity of making the inquiries he had made&#x2014;he had refuted the charges at the time; but suppose he had not had that opportunity, was it nothing to consider the injury that might be done by these accusations going on board the ships months before they could be answered? He regretted that they were now again brought forward, but he certainly felt less alarm than before. Even as it was, they had before done some injury, as he had learnt from officers, who said that they were every day in dread, when the papers with the reports came on board. What was their effect on commodore Keats! They were such that he thought it necessary to demand a court-martial on his conduct. That had been refused, because there was no grounds for it. But was it nothing to have moved the feelings of a meritorious officer thus far? He approved of what had been said, as to the conduct of his noble friend near him (lord Howick), but in fact no board of admiralty would refuse to listen to the complaints of experienced officers. This house would be always ready to attend to the complaints of our gallant sailors, and redress their grievances, but it was necessary to ascertain whether complaints had been made to the proper department, and redress refused. The only motion he therefore thought which could be agreed to on this subject in the present instance was this, "that there be laid before the house copies to the representations of the right hon cap-fain lord Cochrane to the Board of Admiraity, with the answers thereto, if any."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Cochrane</member> <membercontribution>rose to reply and said:&#x2014;I disclaim, sir, any motive whatever except a regard for the real interests of my country, though I am free to confess that I cannot help feeling in common with others the treatment received.&#x2014;Improper motives have been imputed to me, and I might reply to one of those gentlemen who has denied facts which I can prove, that he was one of those who established this abominable system. What his abilities may be in matters not connected with the naval service, I know not; but in the navy it is understood to be a fact, that his noble patron, the earl St. Vincent, sent the master of the Ville de Paris to put his ship in some tolerable order [here there was a cry of order! order! from Admirals Pole, Harvey, and others. The Speaker observed, that
<col>766</col>
when the noble lord said that improper motives were ascribed to him, it was a reproach to him (the Speaker), but he was in the judgment of the house whether he deserved it.] With respect, sir, to the assertion made by the same gentleman, that the health of the men is increased by long cruises at sea, and that that of the commander in chief is improved by being on shore, he may reconcile it if he can &#x2014;Tho', sir, I shall not follow the example of imputing improper motives, another complaint and a just one too (looking at Capt. Sir Samuel Hood) in the naval service is, that under this obnoxious system, captains have been appointed to large commands of 6 or 7 sail of the line, as many frigates, and as many sloops of war, the right of admirals who have served and can serve their country and who have bled in its cause. But perhaps, sir, for such times, their rank did not afford a prospect of their being sufficiently subservient. I believe this house need not be told that there are admirals of ability who from these causes, have lingered in neglect. [a cry of order! order! from admiral Harvey and others. Sir, two parts of the statement of the hon. knight are worthy of remark in so far as they were meant in reply to my statement. He has said he had a hundred men killed and wounded in his ship, and no complaint, no inconvenience, was found from want of lint or any thing else. First, this was at a time when surgeons received an allowance to buy extra medicines for the sick, and, in the second place, the wounded of whom he speaks were sent on the day following to Gibraltar hospital.&#x2014;Now, sir, with respect to the blame said to be directly attributed by me to lord St. Vincent for the loss of the Felix and Atalante I have to remark, that it is of the general system and its consequences of which I complain, of endless cruizes, thereby rendering surveys at sea on the state of vessels a substitute for a proper examination of their condition in port, or in dock. The hon. knight has been a little unfortunate in the comparison he made that lord St. Vincent was no more to blame, than for <i>my</i> getting the Imp&#x00E9;rieuse on shore on the coast of France. Now, since this subject has been touched upon, I must state that I made application for a Court Martial on my conduct, but it was not granted, because it was known that the blame would fall, where it ought to fall, on the person whose repeated positive command sent the ship forth to sea in an unfit condition. The artificers of the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0406"/>
<col>767</col>
yard had not finished the ship; all was in confusion. The quarter-deck guns lay unfitted. Forty tons of iron ballast, beside provisions and stores of all kinds, remained on deck. The powder, allowed to be taken on board only when the ship is out of harbour, was received then, and the Imp&#x00E9;rieuse was hurried to sea without a cartridge filled or one gun loaded. The order issued was to quit the port the <i>instant that she would steer,</i> regardless of every other material circumstance. [Another cry of order! order! from the same gentlemen. The Speaker said, the noble lord must confine himself to the matter before the house.] I consider what I have now said as an answer to a statement made without a knowledge of facts.&#x2014;Another hon. gent. who has attempted to contradict my statements (Admiral Pole) has in his great zeal mentioned an increase of pay which took place some time ago as relative to the present subjects of complaint, and perhaps he has done so with as much sincerity and as laudable an intention as the person who asserted that a profusion of oranges were given to the fleet <i>at Lisbon,</i> in refutation of my statement that none are allowed to the hospitals <i>at home.</i>&#x2014;I have remarked, sir, that I have not heard from any of those who have so zealously spoken on the other side a defence of the obnoxious order to keep all officers and men on board, altho? I think it as tenable as the position that men are to be kept healthy by being kept continually at sea.&#x2014; All these things may appear matters of indifference or of small moment to some who are here at their ease, but I view it in a different light, and if no one better qualified will represent a subject of great complaint, I shall do so, independent of every personal consideration.&#x2014;In the course of the debate, it has been stated, that I asserted lime-juice to be a bad cure for the scurvy; no, it is a cure, and almost a certain cure, but debilitating; it destroys the disease, but ruins the constitution.&#x2014;An hon. gent. (Mr. Sheridan) has said, all this should have been represented to the Admiralty; that this house is an improper place for such discussions, and he has threatened to call for all letters from me to the board of Admiralty. To the first, I answer, that boards pay no attention to the representations of individuals whom they consider under their command and control; next, that if the hon. gent. calls for my letters, he will find some that will not answer his purpose.&#x2014;Sir, beside the public abuses, the oppression and scandalous persecution of
<col>768</col>
individuals, often upon anonymous and encouraged information, has been matter of great complaint. As a single proof of injustice, I have only to mention that one of the most flagrant of those personal injuries done by the Admiralty of which the hon. admiral (Markham) above me was a member, was lately on the simple merits of the case redressed by the noble bold below me (lord Howick), Who sympathized and felt as he ought to feel for a gallant wounded and persecuted officer, (lieutenant R. W. Parker).&#x2014;Sir, the present admiralty, by en-creasing the time allowed for the refreshment of the crews, instead of corrupting their bodies and then drenching them with lime juice, will deserve the gratitude and thanks of all employed. In the navy, we have had to lament the system that makes the admiralty an appendage of the minister of the day, and just as the members of that board began to see and probably to plan the reform of abuses, they have been removed. I trust, sir, that I shall not be denied the papers, and that these motions will not like those on a former occasion be got rid of by a blind vote of thanks, or by any subterfuge of a previous question.&#x2014;The motion was then put and negatived without a division.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[ELECTION PETITIONS.] The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>rose in pursuance of his notice. He observed, that as the session would not be long, it would be inconvenient to take into consideration such Election Petitions as were likely to occupy any considerable length of time. He had thought it his duty to inquire into this subject, and he found that there was not one petition, on which the house could rely in this respect. He proposed, therefore, to discharge all the orders, for the purpose of nominally appointing subsequent days, at such a distance of time, as should shew the parties that the house did not intend to take petitions into consideration during the present session. If the parties to any of the Irish petitions could agree on the subject, it might be well to enter into the consideration of such of them as would require commissioners to be sent to Ireland, in order that the commissions might act during the vacation.&#x2014;The several orders were then discharged, and, beginning with the petitions complaining of double returns, the various petitions were fixed for consideration, on the 9th, 1Oth, 11th, &amp;c, of September.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<date format="1807-06-13">Monday, July 13.</date>
<p><member>[DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY.] Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>rose, and expressed himself happy to see a noble lord (Hawkesbury) in his place, from whom he felt desirous to obtain an answer to a question, respecting which his uneasiness every day increased. The object of that question was to learn from the noble lord, if it was the intention of his majesty's ministers to propose any new measure for the Defence of the Country, or to follow up, on a more extended scale, the system that had already been adopted, so as to make it bear some proportion to the increasing dangers of the empire. He felt it his duty to take this step, in order to relieve not only his own anxiety, but the anxiety that every one must feel at a moment so alarming as the present: should he have the satisfaction to receive such an answer as he expected, then he should have to request the noble lord to state the time when it was likely such a proposition could be brought forward, adding his wish that it might he on an early day; for as the danger increased every hour, he thought it a matter of the most urgent importance, that it should be provided against without delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>was happy to be able to assure the noble viscount and the house, that the subject of the military state of the country had occupied the attention of ministers from their very entrance into office. It might not be proper at the present moment to enter into any explanation of the principle, or of the details of the measure they should have to propose, but the day was not distant when such an explanation should be amply given, and when reasons should be adduced for having deferred it till now. Indeed, on this very day it was expected that a notice would be given in another house, of the introduction of the measure to which the noble viscount had alluded.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Suffolk</member> <membercontribution>intimated the necessity of doing now much more than had as yet been attempted, towards the defence and security of the country. He had observed, with the greatest satisfaction, that on the part of the coast which he had lately visited, the system of the Martello towers had been considerably increased.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[AMERICAN INDEMNITY BILL.] Earl Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day, for the second reading of the bill to indemnify ministers for continuing in force the provi-
<col>770</col>
sions of the American trade bill, which had expired during the recess. The noble earl defended the measure, on the ground of policy and precedent. He allowed that the law had been violated by ministers, but that violation was justified by the reasons of public advantage and benefit which resulted from it, and which parliament had almost uniformly received as a satisfactory justification of such a conduct. Indeed, were it not a violation of the law, why should the crown surrender its prerogative, and come to parliament for a bill of indemnity, when it was obvious no law had been infringed? He could safely deny that the rate of duties had been raised or diminished in any material degree, or where it would have been safe to have acted otherwise. As to the allowing American ships to carry certain articles contrary to the navigation act, that permission was justified by the same policy and necessity; for it would have been much to the detriment of our trade if American ships were on a sudden prohibited to carry such articles,while there were no British ships ready to convey them. In every point of view he could not help thinking that government had acted wisely in continuing the provisions of the bill; and he should therefore move, that the bill to indemnify them for so doing be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>said, that after the sentiments he had already expressed respecting the subject of the breach of the law by issuing the order of council,he could not,without incurring the imputation of inconsistency, agree to the passing of this bill of indemnity. He fully concurred in that part of his noble friend's speech, in which he stated that no money could be levied in this country, without the consent and approbation of parliament. His noble friend, however, went a little farther, and contended that though the law was broken by the crown, no higher duties were levied than it was authorized to collect. Now, it did appear, from a paper which had been laid on their lordships' table, not above three minutes ago, that a system more favourable to the commerce of America, had been adopted, than would have been, if the laws had been observed. His lordship here referred to the document, to shew that in various instances, higher and lower duties had been levied, than the act for continuing the provisions of the former treaty authorized. The order of council remitted the duties upon some articles,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0408"/>
<col>771</col>
while it increased them upon others. It was not to he denied, that both of these were contrary to law, and that they could be only justified by the extreme necessity of the case. But what proof had ministers, either by, documents or by their speeches, afforded the house that any such necessity existed? Were they not, he would ask, aware that it would soon be necessary to renew the act for continuing the former treaty with America? .Why, then, convinced as they must have been of that necessity, did they dissolve the last parliament? Parliament, which bad not the grounds of the dissolution before it, was not bound to take into consideration the necessity which might have existed for that measure. The dissolution of 1784 was justified by the dispute which then arose between the two houses of parliament. That was an unhappy incident in the legislative proceedings of this country, which would always bear out the sovereign in the exercise of his, prerogative, and in appealing to the people. But did any such necessity exist for the dissolution of the last parliament? The convenience of ministers was not in itself sufficient grounds, and he had never hear any other, for that most rash, dangerous and imprudent measure, than which, in all these respects, a greater had never been committed. It was not his custom to dwell upon the dangers and difficulties the country. It had never been his practice to aggravate calamity, or to utter in his place in parliament, any sentiments which might lead to despondency or despair. On the contrary, he always wished to keep alive, not merely the principle of hope, but the principles of resolution and, steadiness, because it was these principles, and these alone, which could enable us to bear up against the dangers with which we might at any time be threatened. He wished, therefore, before he sat down, to draw the attention, of their lordships to what had fallen from a noble viscount. He trusted, that in the most critical period at which this country ever arrived, its security would not rest upon partial and temporary measures. It was desirable that all the resources, strength, energy, and spirit of the country should be called forth The crisis was at length arrived, when it would be necessary to call around us all the military energies of the empire. The first step upon so awful an emergency, which prudent government would take, would be to see whether anything could be done
<col>772</col>
to unite the people. If we were to meet dangers greater than any which had ever threatened us, a divided people, What arms could we employ, what bulwarks raise, or what armies create, adequate to repel them? Much had been said upon this subject, but not, according to his way of considering it, sufficient for its importance. The situation of Ireland could not be too often submitted to the deliberation of parliament, provided it were handled with judgment and moderation. He was sorry to find that an idea had gone abroad, that both the parliament and people of England were pledged, that no farther concessions should be made to the Catholics of Ireland. He was sorry for it; for a more unwise, indiscreet, and mischievous declaration could not have been uttered. Such a melancholy condition was not that of any country, most certainly not of any free government. The noble lord Opposite to him well knew, that the judgment of one parliament often differed from that of another; nay, even in the same parliament, there had been more than one instance of such change of opinion. The appeal from the hasty decision of one meeting, to the prudence of another, bad not been unfrequently successful. Was it, he would ask, right to say to (bur millions of people, You must despair? And despair of what? why that they, subjects of the British empire, were. not to be entitled to the privileges of its constitution. Was it possible that, under any circumstances, there could have been a more improvident declaration? This was his reason for wishing to impress once more upon their lordships these considerations, because he was informed such language had been held. It was not under the impression that the Irish Catholics were to be excluded from the pale of the constitution, that the great question of the Union was carried, No pledge respecting their admission to the same benefits with their fellow subjects, had been either given or required. There were some persons, indeed, who wished to make their participation in the common benefits of the constitution, one of the conditions of the Union. These intentions, however, were overruled, and it was decided that every thing respecting them, should be left to the discretion and liberality of the united parliament. He would ask, why those who now appeared to be of a contrary opinion, did not then speak out? Why they did not I maintain the exclusion of the Catholics, as
<image src="S1V0009P0I0409"/>
<col>773</col>
a fundamental principle of the constitution? Why they did not protest against destroying the bulwarks of our religion in church and state, and letting the Pope into the country? That great minister, who framed the project of the Union, told his sovereign that the union could not be carried into effect,it that boon was not granted to the people of Ireland; and finding, that they were not likely to obtain it,he acted upon it in the same manly manner that he did upon all occasions. Where was this sentiment of exclusion to be found? Was it any where but in those libellous addresses upon the Catholics of Ireland? which he could not but consider ministers as deeply responsible for having advised his majesty to receive. If, in addition to dangers from abroad, we were to encounter divisions at home, the. stoutest of us could scarcely hope that such an accumulation of peril could be successfully resisted. If we resolved to encounter the question, we should do all that was to be done. As this was, perhaps, the last time that he might have occasion to address the house, during the present session, he felt it his duty to intreat their lordships to consider as nothing what had taken place; to meet the question with new feelings and ideas; to reflect that we were in the very crisis of our fate, upon the point, perhaps, of being assailed by the roost formidable enemy that had ever menaced the existence of the government of any country. It was his misfortune to have been a most unsuccessful advocate in favour of the Catholics; but, it his recommendation could have any weight, he would say, that though this was the moment for parliament to grant all those immunities which they claimed, it was not the moment for them to ask for them. Under any of those acts which had been made for restraining that description of his majesty's Irish subjects, under the harsh and compulsory statutes which were repealed in 1793, under the sanguinary and dreadful code which preceded it, their condition, he was persuaded , would be far better than any they could hope to enjoy underthefriendship or domination of France. The first question which was asked by that power, when it meant to overturn the government of any country, was, What are the principles of disunion which prevail? To the excluded, to the dissatisfied, and to the suffering of every country, France threw out these lines and baits; but her professions and her conduct had never accorded with each other. The infatuated persons who
<col>774</col>
listened to her, soon discovered that the state which they renounced was far preferable to that which they obtained. So it would be found in Ireland, should ever the person who now wielded not only the force of France, but of the greater part of the continent, ever succeed in establishing his power in that part of the British empire. To prevent the possibility of any event of this dangerous and alarming nature, he called upon parliament to step forward with a lenient hand, to make a sacrifice of its prejudices, and to throw open the pale of the constitution to those who were interested in defending and upholding it. The question might be stayed off for a time, but a must must be discussed sooner or later. He was aware that it might be objected to him, that those who predict danger, contribute not a little to create it; and that this was not a time to harass and obstruct government. Any one, however, who conceived as he did, who saw not only danger but certain ruin and destruction in maintaining that system of policy he had condemned, would but ill discharge his duty if he hesitated to attack it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>was not anxious to defend the bill of Indemnity on precedents only, but on the grounds of the necessity of the case out of which it grew. Nor would he deny that that necessity arose from the necessity of the dissolution of parliament; for, as often as that topic should again he forced into discussion, so often should he insist on the absolute necessity of that measure. The real authors of that necessity were the very persons who have since so repeatedly and so acrimoniously inveighed against it; for when his majesty, in the legitimate exercise of his prerogative, thought proper to make the late change in his councils, the noble lords opposite him made an appeal to parliament, and brought the question to issue between themselves and their sovereign. What then was left to his majesty, but to appeal to the sense of his people, while the events which made that appeal necessary were still fresh in their recollection? How else was his royal prerogative to be supported? This was the fair, obvious, simple ground upon which the late dissolution rested, and the result had amply proved how well his majesty understood the disposition of his people in making that appeal. For never was their sense more clearly,distinctly, and unequivocally expressed. No means were left untried by the opposers of government, to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0410"/>
<col>775</col>
procure the fullest possible attendance of their adherents in parliament, at the beginning of the present session; yet the sentiment of the nation in favour of the prerogative, was pronounced in the fullest house that ever sat in deliberation, by the largest and most decided majority.&#x2014;Among their lordships it had met with the same loyal and triumphant support. Here then was the necessity and the propriety of the dissolution proved at once in the most marked and forcible manner. He earnestly wished to let the question rest here, but it was impossible to pass over in silence the latter part of the noble baron's speech to which the former part served only as a stalking-horse. The deep regret he felt at some of the sentiments and expressions that fell from the noble baron, he was at a loss how to express; but he was sure they must have made nearly the same impression upon most of their lordships. He was ready to believe that the same feeling and sentiment pervaded every class and description of the community, and that they all were disposed to act with one heart and hand in support of the constitution against the attacks of the most formidable foe that they ever had to contend with, and now made much more formidable by the influence of recent events. Then, what could be the tendency of the noble baron's observations? what the effect they were calculated to produce? But where was the practical good that could result from them? Was it not well known how different were the opinions entertained respecting the chief topic upon which the noble baron had so widely, and, in his mind, so unnecessarily expatiated. Neither could he be ignorant how very generally the opinion of the country had been expressed upon that subject, Where, then, was the utility of the recommendation which the noble baron had so anxiously urged? Was there in past experience, was there in any prospect before us, the slightest ground for considering us a divided people? Even in defence of the Catholics, and in mere justice to that respectable body of men, he would ask the noble baron, when were their exertions wanted, if the threat of danger required them to put them forth? Whatever the difference of opinion they might have entertained upon the other points, were they ever backward, when the appearance of a foreign enemy called for the zeal and activity of their services? Whatever the deprivations under which they had they not always considered
<col>776</col>
them as prosperity and luxury when compared with the promises and the boons by which the enemy would endeavour to seduce them? Then the representations made by the noble baron were unfair, of any description of men who had uniformly manifested such a spirit of loyalty and patriotism. It was unfair surely to describe their conduct and principles in a light that would justify him in calling them a divided people. Respecting our internal policy, there might perhaps be difference of opinion; with regard to the threats and attempts of a foreign enemy, we should always prove an united people, those who possessed least, vying with those who possessed most. He must therefore again express his surprise and regret at the observations of the noble baron, the more so, as they now could be attended with no practical effect, and when his own mind did not appear to be made up respecting any practical remedy. The moment called for universal unity of action, and under such circumstances as the present, he hoped to see all party spirit and animosity turn into zeal for the common defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Spencer</member> <membercontribution>conceived the question to be, whether the necessity which it was admitted had occasioned the breach of the law, was forced on his majesty's ministers, or had been forced on by them. The noble lord opposite had said that his majesty having reason to be dissatisfied with his former servants, had exercised his undoubted prerogative in choosing others in their stead, and that the old servants of the crown had thereupon come to parliament with a statement of their case, thereby making an appeal to parliament on the differences which had occurred between them and their sovereign, and that his majesty had, in these circumstances, been advised to recur to the sense of the people. A more unfounded or a more erroneous statement than this, the noble earl contended, had never been made, as must be well known to the noble lord (Hawkesbury) himself. The fact was, that after certain confidential communications had taken place between his majesty and his late servants, in consequence of which a change in his majesty's councils had taken place, the new servants of the crown, betraying the trust reposed in them, had given garbled and unjust representations in the newspapers, and otherwise, of the conduct of their predecessors, and of the circumstances which had preceded their dis-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0411"/>
<col>777</col>
missal from office. In this state of things, a representation of the actual state of matters, and of the whole circumstances attendant on them, became necessary to clear the characters of the late ministers from the obloquy with which they were thus unjustly loaded. In making this statement, they had been accused of bringing their sovereign to the bar of both houses of parliament. Such a charge, however, they disclaimed. Their only wish was a vindication of their own character, and to bring forward to the bar of both houses of parliament and of the country those persons who had given evil advice to their sovereign. As to the policy of their conduct towards Ireland, it was not his intention to enquire, as that had been already so ably discussed by his noble friend (lord Grenville). But if that part of the population of these kingdoms really did possess the loyalty admitted by the noble lord (Hawkesbury), he could not help thinking that they by no means experienced a corresponding return. He was convinced the time must and would come when the immunities now denied them would be granted. At a season so perilous as the present, we should look to every possible means of strengthening our exertions; but it was impossible that the Catholics in Ireland could feel the same interest in the concerns of the country till they participated in all the privileges of then fellow subjects.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Erskine</member> <membercontribution>said, that it was a fundamental principle of the constitution of this country, that no act could be dune contrary to law, and for which the persons advising it were at the same time intitled to be indemnified, unless such breach of law was occasioned by an act of imperious necessity. If this was a case. of the kind, God forbid that it should be resisted for a moment! No man could question the right of the king to dismiss his servants, or to dissolve the parliament. These were undoubted prerogatives, but they were granted for very distinct purposes. If his majesty saw reason to question the conduct of his servants, he might dismiss them; or, if he saw reason to doubt the parliament, he might dissolve it, and take the sense of their constituents as to their conduct. But the law never intended that both of these prerogatives should be exercised at one and the same time, and with reference to each other. It was never in the contemplation of the constitution of this country, that parliament should be dissolved simply
<col>778</col>
to accommodate a change in administration. This would be to consider parliament not as a controul on the conduct of government, but as an appendage to it, to be dissolved and changed to suit the different aspects which it might assume. The unjustifiable measures which might be adopted, would, in such a view of the case, be objects of little consideration to those by whom they were recommended. Having by the influence of the crown got a parliament to their mind, they had only to begin their career by an act of indemnity for any measure which they might have taken against law, and without necessity. The arrival, of such a period, he must consider as one pregnant with danger. It might be very well to talk of appealing to the sense of the people: what would the community think, however, when informed that there were a number of Boroughs at the disposal of the very persons who advised this dissolution ; and that there were others, the property of, or influenced by, a number of individuals, who, again, were under the influence of the crown? so that success was in such an appeal next to certain. But, still farther, when they saw the seal of indemnity ready prepared for those who advised the measure, must they not be of opinion that the period was most dangerous? If any thing could add the the peril of such a situation, it was the state of things at the present moment, so awful, so unprecedented as it must be admitted to be. The only way at such a moment, to insure confidence and respect from the public, was for the government to shew itself prudent, and for parliament to shew itself independent. That house could do much to effect this object. No person could dissolve them. They had it in their power by a single vote to check such an evil. To protect at once the crown and the people, and to make themselves beloved and esteemed. Their lordships might, by .a single vote, shew that they held a balance between the king and. the people; and might say to the noble lord,: "You advised the king to dissolve the parliament, and if you have since done an illegal act, for which you had no necessity but the dissolution of parliament, we will not grant you an indemnity for an act, the only necessity for which was of your own creation." As to the other part of the question, it had already been so fully and so often argued, that he would not at present detain their lordships any longer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>maintained that the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0412"/>
<col>779</col>
proper question now before the house was, whether it was a right thing in ministers to advise his majesty to pass the order in council? Though ministers might be blameable in advising the dissolution of parliament, still the house was bound to give them indemnity for the act now alluded to, if it could be vindicated. It was not fair by a side-wind to come at a question which he, for one, was ready to discuss and to vindicate openly and fairly. Let the noble lord come forward with a special motion and charge on the subject of the dissolution of parliament, and he should be ready to answer it. The noble and learned lord, while he admitted the excellence of the British constitution, did not seem inclined to trust either the electors or the elected. It was to that house, which could not be affected by the dissolution, that he seemed to look. They could not be dissolved, and from them his lordship seemed to expect a redress of all the evils he supposed to exist. He desired of the noble and learned lord to look to the year 1806, when parliament had been formerly dissolved; there had then been no embarrassing circumstances to render the dissolution necessary; there had been no votes of either house, which indicated a wish to impede the Measures of government; yet that ministry, of which the noble and learned lord formed a part, had chosen to advise a dissolution of parliament. He wished to know in what respect the present ministers were more to blame for having recourse to such a measure, than the late ministers had been. The enquiry into which the late ministers bad forced the two houses of parliament, he considered the most unconstitutional proceeding in which that house had ever been engaged. The permission of his majesty to bring forward this statement, so far from mending the matter, made, it infinitely worse. It was using his majesty's own permission to drag him to the bar of parliament. Such permission ought never to have been asked, and never to have been acted on. His majesty's conduct, however, had in consequence been made a subject of enquiry in both houses of parliament, in a manner which had never formerly been witnessed; and nothing, he presumed, could be more natural than, after such a discussion, to submit the subject to the sense of the country, while the circumstances were fresh in the recollection of the people. A firm and vigorous administration, it was ad-
<col>780</col>
mitted, was necessary for the country. He had no hesitation in declaring it as his opinion, that the present was as firm and gorous as the late administration. It was his wish to render it as firm and vigorous as possible; and with this view, he. had no hesitation in acknowledging, that he was probably one of the most strenuous advisers of his majesty to the dissolution of parliament. His lordship contended that so far were the acts of parliament against Roman Catholics, from being calculated to exclude them from the pale of the British Constitution the only way to secure that constitution both to them and to every other class of subjects in the country was. to maintain these acts. Toleration and power were very different. The British constitution gave toleration to every class of its subjects; but the very nature of the thing rendered it necessary that that power should be vested where it was most calculated to produce and to preserve the good of the whole. If persons who by refusing to qualify themselves for offices of power and trust, had still complete toleration allowed them, they had the benefits of the British constitution. With what consistency, however, he would ask, could the noble lord stop with the officers of the army and navy? why should not the immunity extend to the lawyer also, and to every officer in the civil government of the country? Granting all that the most zealous friends to Catholic emancipation could desire, he was convinced would not produce unanimity in the country. At all events, little would be gained if, in conciliating the Catholics, government should lose the veneration of the Protestants.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Carysfort</member> <membercontribution>contended, that. the, order, of council was a violation of the law and the constitution, springing out of an act as ill judged as it was unnecessary, meaning that exercise of the prerogative in the dissolution of the late parliament, which ministers so unfortunately, in his opinion, advised. It was a dangerous doctrine, his lordship observed, to hold up the plea of necessity for that dissolution: he was exceedingly apprehensive that the precedent might lead hereafter to results destructive of the people's rights; and in such a way too, that even the authors of it might not be able to avert the consequences. It was giving such an enormous addition to the power of the crown, already too much increased, as might eventually bring this country into as complete subjection to the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0413"/>
<col>781</col>
minister of the day, as any of the Barbary States Taking a view of the causes which gave rise to the late change, his lordship observed, that lord Bacon had said that to lead on men from hope to hope, and still to keep them from despair, was the sign of a great statesman. How very different were the ideas the present ministers. The noble and learned lord would employ Roman Catholics neither in civil nor military affairs; he would exclude them from the service of the state either by council or arms. The noble and learned lord seemed also to forget that we passed acts annually dispensing with those very statutes which the noble and learned lord reckoned so material a part of our constitution. Patriotic zeal, not bigoted prejudices, had produced the Revolution, and our ancestors Sent down to their posterity a great example of giving liberty of conscience upon constitutional expediency; and all that had ever been conceded to the Catholics of Ireland, had been well deserved; for, to the present hour, no part nor portion of his majesty's subjects so magnanimously opposed the inroads of a foreign enemy. The noble lord vindicated the wisdom and policy of the intended measure that was to have permitted them to enjoy promotion to the state, and he deplored its failure. He shewed the interest that the Catholics of Ireland had in a Political union with the empire at large, and he thought it hard that four millions of loyal persons should be deprived of that common interest with the rest of their fellow subjects, which in common with them they were entitled to. When he reflected on the late dissolution, and on the principle that actuated it, namely, to add vigour to the new administration, he deprecated it, not merely for making the most unjust sacrifices, but because it attacked the very vitals of the constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Limerick</member> <membercontribution>wished to know what was that undescribed something so often alluded to, but not openly spoken out by the noble lord (Grenville)? Did he mean that we should now go to the Catholics in <i>form&#x00E2; pauperis?</i> should confess that what we had refused ,to them when our enemy was in the east, we were then wrong in withholding, and were ready to grant now he was returning to the west; and that we were now ready to hug the Catholics to our bosoms, and to grant all that we had lately refused? Did the noble lord wish this? Did he really think such a conduct would do good? He was happy, however,
<col>782</col>
to understand from. him that the wordy contest was now over, and that the members of that house were at length to think of something besides debating. Noble lords talked of four millions of Catholics, whose claims were to be granted: but did they recollect, that there were other inhabitants of Ireland, to whom the proposed measures might be disagreeable and disgusting? He spoke as an Irishman and as a Protestant. It would be an act of the greatest baseness to desert the Protestants of Ireland. With respect to the late dissolution, what was the cause of the previous one? Was there no trick, no arrangement, no influence in the elections then? He would name Hampshire; but he could speak more particularly to the county of Wexford. At this moment of public danger, public men ought to suspend their bickerings, to unite their efforts to save the country&#x2014;and not be,like the Greeks, disputing on matters of faith, with the enemy at their gates.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>considered the present crisis as pregnant with the greatest dangers; but he did not express himself so from fear, but from a conscientiousness of our having great exertions to make. He spoke not as a person having any particular local feeling or interest, but as feeling an equivalent interest for every part of the kingdom. The imputation of personal or factious motives, at such a crisis, was beneath any senator in that house to answer, or to attempt to vindicate himself from. Such grovelling sentiments he disdained to notice. The noble secretary of state had admitted the dissolution as entering into the question of the propriety of the conduct of the ministers. He had stated, that the American vessels could not come but by indulgence. But, was not all the money so raised, raised contrary to law? The raising of this money under such circumstances, foreseen by ministers when they projected the dissolution, was, under all its consequences, a very important consideration; and such practices were among the chief causes of the glorious battles fought for the country, in the reign of Charles I., in parliament. It was not merely to rescue us from enormous taxation, that such practices were opposed, but it was to preserve the constitution of king, lords, and commons: it was, in fact, to insure the sitting of parliament. He then proceeded to combat the arguments of the noble and learned lord, in favour of the necessity of the dissolution, upon which he animadverted. warmly.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0414"/>
<col>783</col>
That noble and learned lord, he believe from all he had heard, was, in the practice of the law, very learned; but as a constitutional lawer, and a statesman, there was no unlearned peer in that house whose opinion he would not as soon take; no unlearned Englishman, or foreigner, whom he would not as soon consult on the subject of our constitution. Such perversion of facts such misrepresentation of statements, and of the whole constitutional history of the country, he had never heard, as from the noble and learned lord. The inconvenience of outstepping the law of the land, in raising money, was one of the many inconveniences, and one of the charges consequent upon the recent dissolution. Did the noble lords opposite mean to say, that what they called the improper conduct of the minorities in both houses of parliament, was a sufficient reason for that premature dissolution? Was it a sufficient reason that a strong minority disapproved of the manner of their coming into office? But he would tell these noble lords, who were no friends to a reform in the representation of the people, of which reform the noble lord took care to declare himself an enemy, but to which he (Lord Holland) had been and still was, with certain qualifications, a friend that such measures tended greatly to degrade parliament in the eyes of the country. He thought this consequence too plain to be denied. It was impossible to understand the king's speech but as an appeal on the Catholic question, as it was called. The noble and learned lord had gravely told the house that it was necessary to carry the dissolution immediately. Why?Because four or five days more might have spoiled all the hopes of ministers from the " recent events," and have destroyed all the good effects of the garbled extracts from confidential papers. This was, truly, necessity; out it was necessity for the ministers, not for the country. If parliament did not speedily put an extinguisher upon the doctrines contained in the speeches of the noble lord respecting the impracticability of carrying a measure on which parliament had not pronounced, we should shortly come, after repelling the enemy, to the discussion of a danger second only to that. There never was a speech more calculated to heal wounds than that of his noble friend. Far from exciting agitations, he had stated that he should advise the Catholics not to press their claims. But if they did not press, was that a sufficient reason
<col>784</col>
why parliament should not grant? It was asked whether we should beg the Catholics to help us? Certainly we ought not to go in <i>form&#x00E2; pauperis</i> to a foreign state; but there was no loss of our dignity in redressing grievances at home; in making a few sacrifices to millions of Catholic fellow-subjects, by restoring them to their just rights. He reprobated and abhorred the intolerance of saying that the gates of concession were finally shut, or that the sense of parliament was definitively pronounced. He certainly should not select Mr. Pitt's conduct concerning this question as a chief topic on. which to enlarge in praise of that person. But it was certain he always seemed to look at the subject as one respecting which a favourable opportunity would arrive. It was not true, that noble lords on his side the house had urged on this question No the circumstances of the times had urged it, the improved state of knowledge in Ireland had urged it, the rapid successes of the French had urged it, on the house and on the country. He had less means of knowing the views of Mr. Pitt than many others; but he had that respect for his memory and his understanding, that he thought, were he now alive, he would he found among the, supporters of it. He readily agreed, that, in our circumstances, church and state should be united together: but he saw no reason to decline stating his opinion that the constitution of England did not depend upon my form of religion whatever. From what sources did the great defenders of our constitution draw their lights? Was there not constitution in this country even before the Reformation? Was there none before he test and corporation acts? How, then, could these acts belong essentially to the constitutions? No: they were not declaratory, but merely enacting statutes, which the wisdom and justice of parliament might repeal at pleasure. Was the test act any part of the reformation? Did the noble. and learned lord know that it was a breach if the declaration of Breda? of that proclamation promising complete liberty of,conscience, which that profligate monarch, Charles II. violated? The test was not, passed in Ireland till several years after the accession of king William, though repealed. there for several years past, and the exclusive clause against the Catholics of Ireland were directly against the treaty of Limerick; but, to be told that these were tied to the act of union! let noble lords look to the facts, and see how grossly they were per-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0415"/>
<col>785</col>
verted. The noble and learned lord had talked of the union with Scotland securing those laws. The Tories at that time did, indeed, try to introduce a clause, for maintaining the test, into the articles, the earl of Nottingham making the motion; but it was rejected by a great majority. These were strange perversions of the doctrine of church and state, which was so differently represented by different persons, but which the learned lord thought so simple. He had been told, when he first attentively turned his mind to this subject, to look at bishop Warburton, who was described as unanswerable. He had not a very high veneration for bishop Warburton; but he found that he laid down his principles in a much broader and more statesmanlike manner than the noble and learned lord. He says, it is not the tenets, but the opinion o<ob/>: the great majority of the people that, lays the foundation of this alliance: and let the learned lord apply this to Ireland, and to Scotland. Would he revive in the last-mentioned country the horrors suffered there in the attempt to force episcopacy on the people? He could not think himself an enemy to the church of England in stating the result of his reflections on this subject. which were those of the revolutionists of 1688, and of that excellent prince William III. The learned lord's words were pretty nearly what was said formerly against the Scottish Presbyterians: "But there was no constitution before all this." What! none in Edward the third's time, when the treason laws were passed? To be sure the learned lord had not appeared to like those laws. Very much. Lord Clarendon, who was a very eminent man, but not always enlightened, nor always just, had said that the church of England could never be safe, if the Presbyterian form was established in Scotland. Accordingly, episcopacy must he established in Scotland, and that was attempted by acts as bad as any of those of the inquisition. They had recourse for that purpose to torture. But did they succeed? Mark the conclusion. Read the history of Scotland, and then suppose the union passed, establishing episcopacy in that country, and the king overruled by the sophisticated law of cry lord Clarendon. What would have been the state of Scotland now? But then, should we establish the Catholics in Ireland? To that he would say, that we might, it the case were similar to that of. Scotland. Let the learned lord state what he thinks of the case of Scotland. Why did he propose 
<col>786</col>
episcopacy there, and let there be but one religion, as well as but one parliament? He had never heard of the few bishops in Scotland doing any harm to the establishment of the country. It had been asked, were the Protestants of Ireland to he disgusted? It was not a church-of-England, a Protestant, nor a Christian maxim, to be disgusted at the acquisition of rights, by our fellow subjects. If it be sate to do it, it ought to gladden every Protestant heart. There were degrees of persecution, but these were not to be estimated like the obtainable possession of freehold or other franchises, by any act of special pleading. This eminent country, which had produced such great ornaments of the human race, ought not, to perpetuate a system that other nations had discarded from its narrowness. Was it no privation, no injury to a man, to shut up to him the path of preferment, in arts, in arms, and in councils? His lordship here quoted the strong language of the house of lords in the conference of the 8th of January 1702, which :stated, "that nothing out a crime should incapacitate an Englishman from serving his country."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the statement which had been made on this subject by his majesty's ministers, was so clear, that only one point remained to be explained, and chat was, why the duties levied by the order of council were higher than those levied by the expired acts. He allowed that the law had been infringed, and consequently that a material inconvenience had been incurred. Was the order of council a measure of political necessity, which it would have been criminal in ministers not to advise his majesty to adopt? He thought it was. At the same time, it was perfectly fair in those who disapproved of the dissolution, to tell ministers that they had put themselves into a situation, in which they were compelled to break the law, and that therefore they must abide by the consequences of their ill advice to his majesty to dissolve parliament. Every faculty and energy of the country ought to be called forth in this momentous crisis; but nothing could give him greater alarm than to see such concessions granted to the Catholics as seemed to be recommended by his noble friend who had just sat down. He contended that it was untrue to say we were a divided people. He had opposed the catholic measure, because he thought it pregnant with the utmost danger to the constitution; for, differing completely from his noble
<image src="S1V0009P0I0416"/>
<col>787</col>
friend on this subject, he owned that he had always understood that Protestantism and civil liberty were as inseparable as popery and civil liberty were incompatible. This country must have an established church, if it wished to preserve religion and morals; and what church was preferable to the Protestant?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Redesdale</member> <membercontribution>was adverse to any further concessions to the Irish Catholics, not so much. on account of the objection he entertained against the Catholic religion, as because there were certain political opinions which these Catholics held to be religious. These opinions they adopted in consequence. of their alliance with a falling poliatical party in Ireland, and to the influence of that party might he attributed all the disturbances which had so long agitated Ireland, and also all the difficulties which stood in the way of a complete conciliation of the Catholics. Between the Catholics of Ireland and those of this country, there did, the noble lord observed, exist a material difference is this respect. But he was sorry to perceive that of late years the English Catholics seemed to have adopted too much of the,political character of the Irish Catholics, notwithstanding the prudent and laudable resistance of some of their leaders. As the best means of more closely cementing the connection, between Ireland and this country, the noble lord earnestly recommended the speedy adoption of some measures to strengthen the Protestant establishment in Ireland, which he thought in a very precarious state at present. The difference between the Catholic religion in the two countries he conceived to be this, that in England it was felt to be a tolerated religion, while in Ireland it was the rival of the Established church.</membercontribution></p>

The subject to which their lord-ships' attention had principally been directed, had little connection with the real question, viz. "The Act of Indemnity:" he should,however, so far advert to it as to declare that, in his opinion, the ministers had made out their case and consequently that the proposed bill should have:his sup-
<col>788</col>
port.&#x2014;in that part of the noble baron's(lord Grenville) speech, in which he had again brought the subject of Catholic Emancipation under the consideration of the house, with that strength of expression so peculiar to his lordship, he had reprobated the idea, in a free country, of shutting the door against, the against the of any of his majesty's subjects, and he had charged him, as well as other noble lords, with having held the language of perpetual exclusion. From that charge the noble earl said he felt it necessary to vindicate himself. He had spoken his sentiments under the impressions of his mind, according to his present view of the question; impressions Which, he, was ready to acknowledge, were sufficiently strong to induce him to apprehend, that he might not see the day when he should be enabled to change them: but the arrogance of assuming a political foresight to the extent of saying "the time never would come," was not justly imputable to him. The noble earl said, he would shortly advert to what had fallen from him upon, the motion for amending the Address, as he had been so particularly alluded to by the noble baron. Upon that occasion, in referring to the charge that had been alledged against his majesty's ministers, of having, for electioneering purposes, excited the cry of "no popery," he had neither attempted to exculpate them from the imputation nor had he concurred with those by whom the charge was brought forward. He had stated it as his opinion, that other circumstances had occurred, so obviously calculated to produce a general discussion of the Catholic question, that it was not necessary to look beyond them for the public feeling that had been manifested.&#x2014;The attention of parliament, and of the nation at large had been drawn to that question. by the explanation his majesty's late ministers had thought it their duty to give, of the differences, that had led to their removal from office. By that explanation it appeared, that there was a party in this country, composed of individuals highly respectable for their property, character, and abilities, who were determined to exert every influence they possessed for the purpose of obtaining the repeal of those laws by which the Catholics were restrained from holding certain offices civil and military as well as the capacity of sitting in parliament; and that, in conformity to the opinion entertained by these distinguished persons, a large majority of the king's late ministers had represented to his majesty "That in the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0417"/>
<col>789</col>
"event of their continuance in. office, they must not be understood us being restrained from submitting, from time to time, for his majesty's decision, such measures respecting Ireland, as the course of circumstances should appear to require;" or, in other words, that <i>their</i> system for the government of Ireland would be founded on the principle of further concessions to the Catholics, With such a system, thus openly avowed, attended by communications, intimating to the people of this country that it was directly at variance with the sentiments of his majesty, was it possible, the noble earl asked, that the public mind should not be agitated with the Catholic question? He should not however regret that discussion, because the advantage that resulted from it appeared to him of considerable importance. The sense, of the people of England being now known upon this question, the conscientious obligations of duty by which his:majesty was actuated, would not now be considered as the exclusive obstacle to what is called."Catholic emancipation." The rejection of the Catholic petition by the Irish -house of commons in 1792, followed, as it had been, by the act of the succeeding year, was adduced by the noble baron, as an instance of the little reliance that was to he placed upon any determination that might be taken upon such a subject;and he had been pleased to call that measure a hasty decision." The noble earl said, he could not hear a reflection upon Irish parliament, without rising in its vindication. He had witnessed its proceedings from 1778 to 1794, and he would venture to assert that no public assembly ever pursued the substantial interests of the people with more assiduity, ability, and success, than the Irish parliament had done during that period; nor had any country within the same time, and with the same means, risen to a higher pitch of wealth and prosperity: but whilst, with that energy which real patriotism inspired, the members of the Irish parliament were urging their claims to a free trade, and an independent legislature, the situation of their Catholic fellow subjects was not overlooked,&#x2014;many, if not all, of the most severe restrictions of the penal code having been repealed.&#x2014;The noble earl said, this brought him more particularly to the circumstance mentioned by the noble baron. It was true, he observed, that the Irish house of commons, determined to mark, in the strongest manner, <i>their</i> opinion on
<col>790</col>
the application of the Catholics for the extension of the elective franchise, had, in the year 1792, rejected their petition by a great majority. It was conceived by the members of the Irish house of commons at that time,&#x2014;gentlemen fully capable of understanding, and thoroughly disposed to pursue, the interests of their country,&#x2014;that an acquiescence in the prayer of that petition would be productive of consequences the most fatal to the peace and happiness of Ireland. Unfortunately, however, for those who entertained that opinion, an influence prevailed in the British cabinet, sufficiently powerful to counteract it.&#x2014;The Catholics, having failed in their appeal to their own parliament, sought relief from the hands of the English government. They elected their representatives, they prepared their petition, and the delegates from their body were dispatched to London, and were received by his majesty's ministers in a manner which, strengthened by the most cordial assurances of support, left no doubt upon their minds, of ultimate success.&#x2014;Under these circumstances, the alarm and irritation of the Protestant gentlemen of Ireland was indescribable. They were perfectly alive to the danger of acceding to the expectations of the Catholics; but they felt their confidence in the support of the British government, in the event of a struggle for political power, so far weakened as to render the issue too precarious to be hazarded. They were sensible that something more than deference was due to the authority of the ministers of the empire, upon such a subject; they saw the necessity of a compromise; and the act of 1793, in which they sought to conciliate their Catholic countrymen by the most liberal and. extensive indulgences, was the consequence.&#x2014;The satisfaction, however, of the Catholics, for the liberality of that act, in which every thing that had been asked by them had been granted, was not of long duration; the influence which had operated upon the British ministry continued its activity, and a most respectable nobleman (lord Fitzwilliam) was sent over to Ireland under impressions respecting the policy to be adopted in that country, the disclosure of which had created the greatest alarm.&#x2014;Does the noble baron believe that the Protestant gentlemen then considered the rejection of the Catholic bill in 1792 "a hasty decision?" The noble earl said, he could assure him, a very different sentiment prevailed: it was
<image src="S1V0009P0I0418"/>
<col>791</col>
evident that they had gained nothing by all the concessions that had been made, but that on the contrary, they had given power to men who, as might naturally have been expected, were using. it with a view to further acquisition. Much as had been done by the act of 1793, the state and the parliament had been preserved in the hands of the Protestants.&#x2014;It required no great sagacity to foresee that the measures proposed by lord Fitzwilliam would have transferred the whole authority of the country into the hands of the Catholics: and, with such a conviction on the minds of those who were likely to constitute majority in the Irish parliament, accompanied by a declared resolution to resist the proposition of the government, it was judged adviseable to recall lord Fuzwilliam: but the mischief had unhappily been done The Catholics, disappointed and inflamed, were clamorous in their language, and violent in their conduct; and when so large a proportion of the population of the country was in such a state, it was not difficult for the jacobins of every persuasion to avail themselves of it, for the purpose of perfecting that system of rebellion which they had long meditated, which, though originating in jacobinical principles, revived in it progress all the ancient sources of discord and previous to its termination, was not to be distinguished from the sanguinary contests in which the Protestants and papists had formely been opposed to each other.&#x2014;When the rebellion was suppressed, the subject of a legislative union was brought under the consideration of his maesly's ministers, it being evident that the connection between the two. kingdoms could not be maintained without a material alteration in the system. The admission of the Catholics into the Irish parliament was deemed wholly incompatible with the preservation of the Protestant establishment, and their exclusion from it not favourable to the public tranquillity Under this impression, it appeared to many persons of consideration, that a <i>parliamentary</i> union furnished the only means by which Ireland could be governed consistently, with the principles of the British constitution as established at the revolution, and it was conceived that the Catholics though not relieved from the existing disabilities, might consider their situation much improved, when the discussion of their concerns was no longer confined to men, to whom they
<col>792</col>
might be disposed to attribute the operation of local passions and prejudices; and when, by the abolition of the close boroughs, and the effect of a popular representation, they might expect to obtain an influence upon the members from their own country, fully adequate to the protection of their persons and property, and the security of their interests, in whatever shape they might be brought before parliament. In this opinion, the noble earl said he had concurred, and upon being consulted by Mr. Pitt, had expressed himself to that effect. With reference to that part of the noble baron's speech, in winch he had intimated to their lordships his conviction that no pledge had been given to the-Catholics, by Mr. Pitt, the noble earl said he was enabled to add his own testimony. He had been called upon by him with other persons belonging to the parliament of both Countries to prepare, under his instructions, the articles, constituting the basis of the Union. He could confidently assure the house, that, so far from any pledge to the Catholics being in contemplation at that time, the subject was not even introduced as a topic for discussion; and he would and that, if Catholic emancipation, as it is called, had been considered as a necessary consequence of the measure, that he, as well as many of its .warmest advocates, would certainly have opposed it. He would ask whether any member of his majesty's government had ventured state in the parliament of either country that such a consequence was likely to follow from the Union?&#x2014;He would put it to the noble baron, whether the confidential servants of the king had prepared his mind for such a result? How, then, could it be supposed that Mr. Pitt had held out such an expectation to the Catholics? The noble earl said, he was so much satisfied to the contrary, and he was called upon by the respect he bore to Mr. Pitt's memory to say so, that he was persuaded, his subsequent conduct, upon that subject, was governed by considerations, that had not occurred until after the union of-the legislatures had actually been carried into execution.&#x2014;The noble earl deeply lamented the agitation of this question, under the present circumstances. He was not disposed to question the motives of any of any noble lord, much less those of the noble baron; but, surrounded as we were with difficulties he was apprehensive the most serious mischiefs would arise from this discussion.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0419"/>
<col>793</col>
&#x2014;He agreed with the noble lord who had just sat down, that nothing would be gained by the proposed concessions; that there were other objects lurking behind, infinitely more important in the eyes of the Catholics, and that what the noble baron had recommended would, if acceded to, he productive of no permanent advantage, whatever effect it might have in raising the expectations, and adding to the power of those, whose advocates had never been able to state a limit to their demands, and whom there was no hope of satisfying but by the complete sacrifice of our establishment in church and state.&#x2014;The noble earl concluded by expressing his, concern that the noble baron should have signified an intention of withdrawing from if their lordships should adhere to their former resolution upon the Catholic,question. He trusted the noble baron. would not retire from the service. of his country at a time when abilities like his could not,be dispensed with. It was a time when to every man ought to be at his post; and he considered that of the noble lord to be his place in the house of peers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Grenville</member> <membercontribution>disclaimed all intention of substituting Catholic for a Protestant establishment a Ireland: no man would, more decidedly oppose such a proposition, if it could possibly be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member> <membercontribution>observed, that when he was lord lieutenant of Ireland, it concessions were made to the Roman-Catholics of that country; those concessions were authorised by the king and by the ministers of this country. As to the other principal point that had been urged in debate, the dissolution, parliament had already come to a decision on that head. He should, therefore, leave these questions their lordships' consideration without any observation on his part.&#x2014;The question was then put and carried in the affirmative.</membercontribution></p>

made his election to serve for the latter place.&#x2014;The chancellor of the exchequer brought down the following message from the king: "G. R. His majesty being desirous that the house called The Queen's House at Frogmore, with certain grounds thereto belonging and adjoining, should be secured to her majesty for her life and the lives of the princesses his majesty's daughters, recommends it to his faithful commons to enable his majesty to grant and settle the same, in such manner, and with such provisions, as may most effectually accomplish the said purpose. G. R." Referred to a committee of the whole house.&#x2014;Mr. R. Dundas brought in a bill to enable the East-India company to raise money upon Bond instead of increasing their capital stock; which was read the first time.&#x2014; The house, on the motion of the chancellor of the exchequer, resolved itself into a committee of supply, to which the report from the committee appointed to prepare estimate of the charge of the pay and clothing of the militia of Great Britain and Ireland was referred. The following sums were then voted; tor extraordinaries of the army, incurred from 25th December 1805, to 25th December 1806 and not provided for by parliament, 793,710<i>l</i>. 0<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.; Army extraordinaries for Great Britain for the year 1807, 2,960,000<i>l</i>.; ditto for Ireland 600,000<i>l</i>. It was. also voted, that a provision be made for-the pay and clothing of the militia of England and Ireland, and a provision for the allowances to serjeant-majors, adjutants, and subaltern officers of militia in Great Britain. The house then resumed, and the report was ordered to be received to-morrow.&#x2014;The Chancellor of the Exchequer rose to propose a Lottery or Lotteries, in which the tickets should not exceed 100,000, at 10<i>l</i>. a ticket. There had been a suggestion made to the.treasury, that it might have a better effect if the prizes in the first lotteries of the year were to be paid in lottery tickets instead of money. Upon this subject they had come to no resolution, but he thought it proper to inform the committee of the suggestion. He therefore proposed that the lords of the treasury should be authorized to contract with such persons as were disposed to bid for a lottery or lotteries containing 100,000 tickets. The resolution was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>brought up his bill for promoting
<image src="S1V0009P0I0420"/>
<col>795</col>
and encouraging Industry amongst the Labouring Classes, and for the better Regulation and Relief of the Necessitous Poor; which was read a first time. On the question that the bill be read a second time, he expressed his regret that he should not be able to bring forward the second reading, on the day on which he had at first proposed, because he felt himself in the same situation with several other hon. members, who would be obliged to attend their duties as country gentlemen, at the Quarter Sessions and at the Assizes. Being upon his legs, he wished to take that opportunity of adverting to the very alarming situation of public affairs, and putting a question to the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer whether it was in the contemplation of his majesty's ministers to submit an immediate proposition to the house, founded upon the distressing circumstances, in which the late calamitous intelligence from the continent shewed the world in general, and this country in particular, to be placed. If any such proposition were intended, he trusted, that it would not be brought forward without proper notice, and that the right hon. gent. would not think of discussing a question of so much importance, whilst a large proportion of the members of that house would be necessarily absent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer </member>, <membercontribution>in reply to the hon. gent., rose to do that, which it had previously been his intention to do, as soon as that hon, member should have sat down; namely, to give notice on the part of his noble friend, the secretary of state for war and the colonies, to, bring forward a, motion on Friday next, relative to the military state o f the country. He should he sorry, therefore, that the observations which had fallen from the hon. gent. should induce the house to suppose, that Friday was an inconvenient day for that purpose. He could see no reason why his noble friend might not on Friday open his plan to the house, because that plan could not be carried into effect without a bill, in the various stages of which there would be frequent opportunities, during the course of next week, of discussing its merits. But if it should be the feeling of the house, or even the wish of the hon, gent., himself, that the motion of his noble friend should be deferred to Monday, he had no hesitation to say, that his noble friend would not have any objection to put off his motion to that day. If, on the contrary, the house should feel that no inconvenience would arise from having the general exposition of
<col>796</col>
the plan made on Friday, under an understanding that it would be to be dismissed in detail, after the introduction of the measure founded upon that exposition, he availed himself of that occasion to give notice of the intention of his noble friend, to bring forward the motion on Friday.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread </member>, <membercontribution>though desirous of being present at all the stages of so important a question, did not feel disposed to object to the course proposed by the right hon. gent. But he begged leave to submit, whether the proposition of the noble lord might not be made on Friday, and the discussion upon it adjourned to the Wednesday following.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>expressed his entire acquiescence in the arrangement proposed by the right hon. gent., and declared himself personally obliged to him for his early communication to him of the intention of the noble lord, respecting the important motion which he was to make on Friday. He wished to be informed, whether, as there was every appearance of engagements having been entered into with foreign powers, it was likely that any communication would be made to the house on the subject of such engagements at an early day. This question he put, because he thought it important that the house should have some information upon the subject, but if the right hon. gentlemen opposite should consider it incompatible with their sense of public duty to give an answer, he should not press the matter further.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>replied, that undoubtedly certain engagements had been entered into with foreign powers, and that it had been the intention of his majesty's ministers not, to suffer parliament to separate without making a communication upon the subject. These engagements had, however, been contingent, and ministers had thought it better to defer that communication for a short time, in order to ascertain whether the contingency upon which the engagements depended would take place, It never had been ,the intention of his majesty's government to suffer the present session to elapse, without making a communication to parliament; and he had reason to thinks that early in the next week, he should have the authority of his majesty to make a communication on that subject to the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[ROMAN CATHOLIC COLLEGE AT MAYNOOTH.] Mr. foster</member> <membercontribution>said that with respect to the grant-to the Roman Catholic seminary at Maynooth he had given notice that he would move for the ordinary grant of 8000<i>l</i>; but not then thinking the additional
<image src="S1V0009P0I0421"/>
<col>797</col>
grant of 5000<i>l</i>.necessary, he had said that he should not move for it. He now rose to give notice, that he should not for the present year withhold his consent to the additional grant, as it had appeared, that the building depending on such money had been already commenced; at the same time he wished it to be distinctly understood, that he did not, by now supporting it, at all pledge himself to support the said grant at a future period, the propriety of continuing which he thought a matter of great question, as it went to no less than double the Maynooth establishment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. C. Wynne</member> <membercontribution>said, that as The right hon. gent. had thought it proper to decline pressing his objections to the additional grant, he should not think it necessary to move at present for the documents which Would to substantiate the claims of the Maynooth establishment, to that additional grant. He should therefore withdraw the notice he had made to that effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>was extremely glad, that up on further consideration the right hon. gent. had thought it wise to abstain from a measure that must naturally have proved of the most dangerous and mischievous tendency; nor could he think, that the right hon. gent. had so satisfactorily accounted for this change of opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>rose to order, and submitted to the noble lord if would not be better to postpone all observations of that nature until the question was regularly before the house, as, if such proceeding was admitted, the gentlemen on the other side would feel themselves justified in even being irregular while answering to such irregularities.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>proceeded to observe upon the right hon. gent's statement; the right hon. gent. objected to the additional grant the other day, and now assented to it, be cause he had learned what on the first day he ought not to have been ignorant of, that the buildings had been already begun, and yet the right hon. gent., after assigning, that reason stated that he would for the future object to it, because it was in fact doubling the Maynooth establishment. If the right hon gent. did not at first know that the building were already begun, his ignorance of that fact, could. have had nothing to do with doubling the establishment, and if such a grant did double the establishment, the actual commencement of the building could not be any argument why the grant shout be now acceded to.</membercontribution></p>
<col>798</col>
<p><member>Mr. Foster</member> <membercontribution>rose to order, and insisted that it was quite unparliamentary to enter into the merits of any measure to be proposed, of which notice had been only then given.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>thought it better that any thing to be said upon the subject should be deferred to the time appointed for the discussion thereupon, as the subject was not then before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>said, that he certainly felt it his duty to bow to the decision of the chair, at the same time that he should take good care to enforce the strict exercise of the rule that had been now applied to him. and upon all occasions, for the future, when a notice was given, he would take care that that notice should not be followed up by any further question or comment whatever. He was certainly fully aware how troublesome it must be to the right hon. gent. to have questions put, which it might not be convenient to answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS BILL.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>moved the second reading of the Parochial Schools bill. The question being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Davies Giddy</member> <membercontribution>rose and said, that while he was willing to allow the hon. gent. who brought forward this every degree of credit for the goodness,of his intentions, as well as for his ability and assiduity; still, upon the best consideration he was able to give the bill, he must totally object to its principle, as conceiving it to be more pregnant with mischief than advantage to those for Whose advantage it was intended, and for the country in general. For, however specious in theory the project might be, of giving education to the labouring classes of the poor, it would, in effect, be found to be prejudicial to their morals and happiness; it would teach them to despise their lot in life, instead of making them good servants in agriculture, and other laborious employments to which their rank in society had destined them; instead of teaching then subordination, it would render them factious and refractory, as was evident the in the manufacturing counties it would enable them to read seditious pamphlets, vicious books, and publications against Christianity; it would render them insolent to their superiors and, in a few years, the result would be, that the legislature would find it necessary to direct the strong arm of power towards them, and to furnish the executive magistrates with much more vigorous laws than
<image src="S1V0009P0I0422"/>
<col>799</col>
were now in force. Besides, if the bill were to pass into a law, it would go to bur-then the country with a most enormous and incalculable expence, and to load the industrious orders of society with still heavier imposts. It might be asked of him, would he abolish the Poor-Laws altogether? He had no hesitation to declare he would; for, although they relieved many persons, who were certainly objects of compassion, they were also abused by contributing to the support of idleness and profligacy; and he never could admit it to be just or reasonable that the labour of the industrious man should be taxed to support the idle vagrant. This was taxing virtue for the maintenance of vice. He concluded by moving, that the bill be read a second time this day three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Morris</member> <membercontribution>concurred in opinion with the hon. gent., though he was not prepared to go the full length of all his objections. He agreed, that the establishment of a system so universal, must entail upon the country an incalculable expence, at least 2s. in the pound upon the poor's rates; and he thought, that as a national system of education, the expence should rather be paid out of the Consolidated Fund, than by a local assessment upon Parishes. In Scotland, he said, the public charge upon the country was but 6000<i>l</i>. a year for allowances to schoolmasters for the poor, while the remainder was made up by charges upon the landlord and tenant, or by voluntary subscription; while in England, a single charitable society for propagating Gospel knowledge, expended 4000<i>l</i>. a year, being two thirds of the whole public charge in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ellison</member> <membercontribution>gave great credit to the hon. gent. who brought in this bill, as well for his good intention in bringing it forward, as for his care in circulating it for the consideration of the magistrates throughout the kingdom. It had been fully considered; but every magistrate with whom he had conversed, was decidedly averse to it and instructed their representatives to oppose it. He was convinced the operation of the poor-laws and the public charitable schools, already in existence, were fully adequate to ameliorate the situation of the poor. But if there were schools to be built, provided under this bill, and schoolmasters and mistresses employed in 14,000 parishes, the expence must be enormous.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. S. Bourne</member> <membercontribution>wished the bill should stand over to the next session. And he
<col>800</col>
begged, in the mean time, to suggest to the hon. gent, who brought it forward, that it would perhaps be better not to make the bill compulsory upon all parishes, but merely to enable the overseers, with the consent of the vestry in any parish, to raise, by way of rate, a sum for the support of schools, which they were not enabled to do as the law now stood; voluntary education Was at all times preferable to compulsory; and some measure of this kind, he conceived, would prove more effectual than the present. He must add, also, that the situation of parish apprentices demanded the attention of the house. Almost every magistrate must have heard of cases of atrocity, with regard to their treatment, that ought, if possible, to be prevented. They were to be imputed principally to the compulsory nature of the obligation to take them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Samuel Romilly</member> <membercontribution>lamented the very different reception this bill net with now, Compared with what it had experienced in the last parliament. He thought the bill ought to be allowed to go into a committee, where it might receive full consideration, and such amendments as might give it a fair chance of going forth to the country in a form less liable to objections. An hon. gent. complained that the poor-laws were abused for the maintenance of profligates; but it was the very object of this bill to render the poor less profligate, and less in need of eleemosynary support. He agreed with the last speaker as to the importance of attending to the condition of parish apprentices. It was the practice to send them to as great a distance as possible, where they had no friends who could attend to their situation. In some parishes in London they were accustomed to send them to the distance of some hundreds of miles, and to contract with the proprietors of the cotton mills of Lancashire, &amp;c. for so many of them, who were sent off in carts like so many negro slaves.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>would be sorry to oppose the Bill going into a committee , provided it was. understood it should not pass this session. He had no doubt that the poor ought to be taught to read; as to writing, he had some doubt, because those who had learnt to write well, were not willing to abide at the plough, but looked to a situation in some counting house. With respect to the poor-rates, it they did not now exist, he would propose them, because he thought that the relief of the poor ought inn to. be left with the generous to the exemption of the miser.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0423"/>
<col>801</col>
<p><member>Mr. Lushington</member> <membercontribution>supported the principle of the bill, and argued for going into a committee. In every country where the poor were well instructed, they formed. the better subjects in every point of view. This measure would rather diminish than increase the poor-rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>felt the strongest predilection for parochial schools, and certainly agreed in the principle of extending information as much as possible among the lower ranks. The object however, which he rose, was to state in answer to the hon. and learned gent. over the way (Mr. Morris), that the expence was greater Scotland, than what he supposed it to be. The rates for the schools there, were levied on the landlords, who resorted to their tenants for one half; they besides settled a rate of fees from such of the landlords as could pay them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>was decidedly against the bill, as going to inflict a compulsory education on the country at a most incalculable expence. At all events he thought that a bill of so much importance, to every part of the country, ought not to be discussed in so thin a house, and in the absence of the magistrates ant country gentlemen, who were the persons competent to throw the most light on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>expressed his surprise that any objection should be thrown in the way a the bill in this stage of it. He replied to the argument, that those who had got some,education would look higher, because they were above the generality. This would not be the case if the generality of the lower orders were well educated. There must be a lower order of people who must perform the manual labour of country; and the better informed they were, the better they would be in every respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr Wharton </member>, <membercontribution>in answer to the last speaker, begged leave to ask, whether the noble lord would have the ministers and churchwardens hold a critical examination in order to ascertain who were fit to be exalted to the counting-house, and who were only fit for the plough?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>replied, that the hon. gent., with his examinations, had chosen to attach a meaning to his noble friend's words that had never entered his head. His noble friend had intimated that there must be a lower order, and the better informed they were, the better they would be. There would be no need of the hon. gent.'s
<col>802</col>
examination. The thing would settle self. With respect to the arguments about the absence of country gentlemen, and the. thinness of the attendance, they had no weight whatever with him. There were questions which interested the passions of men, on which there would be a great attendance; there were others of the last importance, of which he considered the present as one, on which the attendance would always be thin. He meant to persevere, in order to have a decision on the grand principle, and he. would not put off the matter when there were occurrences arising day after day fully sufficient to occupy the time that could be spared on any future occasion. If the matter was not considered when it was fresh in the mind, it would not be considered at all. All the arguments for postponing it were therefore futile in the highest degree. If the matter were to lie over for ten years, it would not be considered till it was pressed forward. What he wanted at present was to have this grand question decided, "whether it was proper that education should be diffused among the lower classes, or not ?" That the principle was sound, he was convinced; whether the country was ripe for it, was another question. That it would be adopted some time or other, he had no doubt; if it was rejected at present, he could only conclude that the country was not yet ripe for it. As to the abolition of the poor-rates, that was at present out of the question. As to the expence of education, it was stated by many at a great deal more than it would actually amount to. All the lower orders had an education of some sort, good or bad. It had been said that it might be as well to teach them to play on the fiddle, or to be skilful boxers. This practice of boxing, by-the-bye, as a mode of settling differences,he thought ought not to be discouraged, because it was much better than the stiletto. But a fiddler or boxer would not be the worse for being able to write and read. At St. Giles's there was an education; children were taught to pick pockets, and to go on from one degree of dexterity in wickedness to another, till they came to the gallows; and most of the unhappy creatures who perished there, were such as were unable to read or write. He adverted to the too great severity of our criminal code, which he was convinced had not the effect of diminishing the number of crimes. Among the-society called Quakers, crime was almost unknown, and
<image src="S1V0009P0I0424"/>
<col>803</col>
this was accounted for by their being education in their earliest years. The expence here would be greater, it was said, than in Scotland. But Scotland was not so large nor so opulent. He denied that the people, if generally educated, would be averse to continue at the plough. On the contrary, the ground would be better tilled, masters better served, &amp;c. The hon. gent. then replied to the argument about their reading political pamphlets. When a riotous mob was assembled, it was called an illiterate mob. If one man had knowledge, he would have a much better chance of leading a thousand ignorant creatures to mischief, than if they were all so far in formed as to read what might appear on both sides of the question. He then begged the house to look at the situation of Ireland. There the combinations were formed by the ignorant, where their ignorance made them the dupes of the wicked. In the three kingdoms, the excellence of the population would appear to be in proportion to the degrees of information among the lower classes. As to the vices of the lower orders, which had been mentioned by an hon. gent., vices certainly did prevail more or less every where; but in those places where the lower orders were most remarkable for their vices the example was set them by their superiors, who were generally more vicious than they. It was said that the effect of the bill would he to impose an additional rate of a shilling in the pound. He answered, no. It was said, it would do away charities. It would do no such thing. His aim was, to provide schools and school-masters where they were wanted; where they were not, the magistrates would have the power to suspend the operation of the law. The business was committed to the magistrates, who were the most proper persons to carry the act into execution. The system of magistracy had defects; but in what other country was there a body so excellent? As to the suggestion of the hon. gent. (Mr. S. Bourne), he thought that his own was the best plan; but, however, he would rather adopt his voluntary mode than none at all. He had done his duty in bringing this bill forward; and he should persevere until the house should divide upon it; and if they were to reject it, he should nevertheless go away, convinced of its utility, and conscious that it was rejected only because the house was not ripe for its adoption.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Marquis of Titchfield</member> <membercontribution>thought much
<col>804</col>
benefit might result from general education, but said that benefit might cost too dear. He wished therefore for some information as to the probable expence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>could not say how far the parishes might be provide with, or be destitute of buildings that might answer for schools. In many parishes it would not be necessary to expend a shilling on that account. School-masters could be provided at a very cheap rate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>wished the bill to go into a committee, with a view to the utmost, fairness of consideration. It was the wish, unquestionably, of every one in the house to render the lower classes of the community better and happier. He feared however, that the kind of education here proposed, though it might give learning, would not contribute much to diffuse industry, religion, or morality. He feared a general legislative establishment would injure and destroy the voluntary establishments for public education now existing. He recommended a commission of enquiry to ascertain the state of charitable foundations for public education already established. A commission of that kind was is now prosecuting a similar investigation in Ireland without any salary to the commissioners, and with but very few clerks. When such a commission should have ascertained what had been already done, it would I be time enough to enquire what further might be done. He defended the principle of the poor-laws. However the system might be abused, as every large system must be liable to abuse, it was a proud characteristic of the nation, that charity was incorporated into the legislature. The poor of this country had consequently an interest in the maintenance of its constitution and independence, which the poor of no other country had. He said the education proposed would disqualify the persons possessing it from the most necessary, and useful description <ob/>, labour. The Quakers were mentioned as a class universally educated. The example strengthened his argument; for he never knew of an Agricultural Quaker. He wished the bill to be made as perfect as possible, though he did not think it advisable ultimately to adopt it, and without a prospect of ultimate adoption it would perhaps be useless labour to improve the plan.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, that the instances of the royal mercy were the best proof of what he had said.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir. John Newport</member> <membercontribution>contended, that the code was sanguinary, and that experience had shewn that capital punishment could not annihilate the crime of forgery. He contended, that the commutation of death, the effect of which was momentary, to some other punishment, under a-prolonged life of labour and degradation, would be much more effectual than the gallows.&#x2014;The gallery was then cleared; but it was agreed that the bill should be read a second time without a division. When strangers were admitted,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>spoke in favour of going into the committee, but he thought compulsory education unadviseable, when voluntary education was every-where establishing itself so extensively.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>saw no good that could arise from going into a committee, and therefore opposed the speaker's leaving the chair, on the same grounds that he had objected to the second reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Spencer Stanhope</member> <membercontribution>informed the house, that he had been instructed by the magistrates of a very large and populous city to oppose the bill; in fact, he had reason to suppose that the majority of the magistrates and other principal inhabitants throughout the north of England were averse to the measure. The opposition which the hon. member made to the bill, he rested principally on the ground of the difficulty which existed as to our obtaining a sufficient number of schoolmasters, and on the impracticability of compulsory education.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty </member>, <membercontribution>expressed his difference in opinion from those gentlemen who apprehended that danger might result from carrying the education of the lower orders too far, as they expressed it. The measure which was then before the house went no farther than barely to furnish youth who were destitute of all other means, with a certain source of obtaining a very plain and limited education. The magistrates in the north objected to this measure, he understood, on an apprehension that they would be compelled to erect schools, and go to other expence, which would be in many parts unnecessary, as they already possessed within themselves sufficient means of education for the children of the poor in that part of the country. It was to be observed, however, that there was a clause in the bill expressly for the purpose of pre
<col>806</col>
venting the extension of its operations to places in which there might be already establishments formed adequate to the purposes of the bill. If it should be <ob/>, however, that the bill was not sufficiently strong in that respect, any emendation on that head would be best effected when the bill should be in a committee.&#x2014;Mr. Whitbread and Mr. D.

<p><member>[AMERICAN INDEMNITY BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>Their lordships went into a committee on this bill, in which lord Holland read an amendment, which he proposed to substitute for the preamble. It was his lordship's object to place the indemnity in what he regarded as its true light, and to shew that such a proceeding was a matter of more serious importance than was generally apprehended. The amendment referred to the navigation act, the tonnage, and poundage, and recited that part of the bill of rights which relates to breaches of the law by the crown, and raising money without the sanction of parliament; and quoted the act of commerce with America, and the order of council in May last, in order to shew the ground on which the indemnity was claimed. The amendment was negatived in the committee, but lord Holland moved it again on the report, with the view that it might be entered on the journals of the house. It was then negatived also, and the bill was reported without any amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[AMERICAN TRADE BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion that this bill be read a second time,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>rose. He expected that some noble lord in administration would have stated the grounds on which the bill ought to proceed. However, as that had not been done, he should briefly state the reasons which induced him to approve of the measure. These were chiefly the obvious interests of the united states of America and this country to cultivate a good understanding and friendship; they had more interests in common than any two countries in the world. In every friendly intercourse between two countries, there was, in his
<image src="S1V0009P0I0426"/>
<col>807</col>
opinion, always a mutual advantage: but this reciprocity of interest was most remarkable, as it existed between the united states of America and Great Britain. In the present eventful crisis, a good understanding between the two countries must be important, not only to themselves, but to all independent nations, and this the enlightened government of the United States could not but perceive. In different parts of Europe, in which it had been his lot to travel, he had often heard it asserted, that it was not likely the United States could preserve their present independent government. He was of a very different opinion. The republican institutions of America, like those of every government in which a true spirit of freedom prevailed, contained energies which were capable of being called forth to meet any difficult crisis that might occur, and all that he had heard urged on this subject, appeared to him to result from the prejudices of persons educated under arbitrary monarchies. Nothing therefore could appear to him worse policy than to wish to see any thing like disunion among the people of the United States. Indeed, the more powerful and the more wealthy they became, the better would it be for this country. As they become more populous, the customers for our manufactures would become more numerous, and increase of riches would only give them increased means of consumption. Entertaining these views, he was extremely happy to find that the present administration had, in their policy towards America, thought proper to follow the steps of their predecessors, though a different conduct was to have been expected from them, in consequence of the language they had held when in opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>had not thought it necessary to address their lordships in support of this bill, as it was precisely the same as the act which had passed last year and the year before. He contended, that administration acted with no inconsistency in taking up measures as they had been left by the preceding government, though their view of the subject might have been different before they came in<ob/>o office. With regard to the policy to be pursued towards America, he and his colleagues had, from the moment they took upon themselves the charge of the government, resolved to pursue the system which had devolved to them from their predecessors, unless new circumstances should arise to induce them to depart from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Harrowby</member> <membercontribution>argued on the same side,
<col>808</col>
in support of the consistency of the present ministers in this respect, and contrasted their conduct, when in opposition, with that of the noble lords now in opposition to his majesty's government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdule</member> <membercontribution>contended, that nothing could be more widely different than the conduct of his friends, when in opposition, from that of the noble lords opposite to him, when they opposed the late administration. With smooth and gentle tongues they professed a readiness to support that government, but with these professions on their lips, they resorted to every illiberal, underhand, unmanly means, to subvert the power of those whom they were pretending to support. The very opposite was the character of the opposition to which he was ambitious to belong; an open, fair, liberal, and principled opposition; and he trusted he never should expose himself to the disgrace of belonging to such as the last, who were now in power; but whose possession of power ought to be contended against by every man who understood and cherished the spirit of the constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Mulgrave</member> <membercontribution>recollected that the noble lord had attached himself to a variety of persons both in and out of place; but had distinguished himself most by a disciplined opposition to his majesty's government. For his own part, he had but one political attachment, and to that he gloried to adhere. If it was a disgrace to have belonged to any opposition, It was not for him exactly to say to what opposition the term of disgrace belonged; that must depend upon the sense and opinion of the country at large, and not of any individual: but late events had pretty clearly shewn what was the true feeling and opinion of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>said, he did not mean any thing personal to the noble earl: for he could not indeed charge his memory with any thing the noble earl had ever said or done to distinguish his political conduct.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>observed, that there never was an administration which had less occasion to complain of a factious and harassing opposition than the last. There was, in fact, nothing like a systematic plan to oppose their measures, among any of those with whom he had the honour to act. "All the Talents," as they were called, were absolutely without any opponents in that house, or any where else he believed, until they began to oppose themselves.&#x2014;The bill was then read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-07-14">Tuesday, July 14.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion of lord Barnard, a new writ was ordered for the election of a member for the borough of Bandon, in the room of lord Boyle, now earl of Shannon. Also for the election of a member for the borough of Tralee, in the room of sir A. Wellesley, who had made his election for the borough of Newtown, for which also he had been returned.&#x2014;Mr. Long moved for leave to bring in a bill to enable the trustees of the British Museum to sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of, such parts of their collection as were not adapted to the purposes of that institution, and to lay out the produce in the purchase of other articles better adapted to their purposes. The articles which it was proposed to dispose of, were anatomical preparations, and other things of that nature. The disposal of these articles, and the purchases to be made with the produce, were to be under the controul of a committee of seven, at the head of which were the lord chancellor, the speaker of the house of commons, and the archbishop of Canterbury. The establishment was now placed on such a footing, that it was calculated in every respect to answer the purposes intended by parliament. Leave was given to bring in the bill.&#x2014;On the motion of Mr. Foster, the house went into a committee, to consider of the compensation to be made for the fees of offices abolished in the department of the customs in Ireland. Mr. Foster stated, that the commission of enquiry into the fees of offices in Ireland had particularly recommended the extension of the retrenchment and regulation of the customs fees adopted in this country to Ireland. It became necessary, in consequence of the adoption of that measure, to make compensation to the officers whose fees were suppressed. The amount of the compensation to be paid was about 100,000<i>l</i>. He proposed to raise this sum by a tax of 6 per cent. on imports and exports, with the exception of imports and exports between Great Britain and Ireland. The merchants would find this tax less burthensome than the fees. The produce would be about 90,000<i>l</i>. If this sum fell short a little, the certainty and regularity of the payment would compensate the officers for the trifling reduction. He moved accordingly, that such a compensation be granted. After a short conversation between sir J. Newport, who
<col>810</col>
thought that the compensation ought to be provided for by some more equal charge, than one that fell wholly upon foreign imports and exports, the fees being equally paid upon imports and exports between Ireland and Britain, and Mr. Foster who answered the hon. baronet's objections, the motion was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[ARMY CLOTHING AND AGENCY.] Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member>, <membercontribution>with a view to shew the practicability of very considerable savings in the Army Clothing and Agency departments, rose to move for a number of papers which he had yesterday given notice of his intention to call for, and to the production of which he did not understand there was any objection. The present mode of clothing the army, by converting the colonels of regiments into a species of wholesale tailors, was particularly reprehensible. In the agency department also, much unnecessary expence was incurred. On the whole, he was convinced a saving of no less than 2 per cent. might be made on the 2,000,000<i>l</i>. now annually expended on the army. The hon. gent. concluded with moving, "That there be laid before the house, 1. An account of all sums of money issued to the army agents from the 25th of Dec. 1805, to the 24th of Dec. 1806; specifying the names of those agents, the number of regiments of the line, militia, and fencibles, for which they are employed; and the amount of the securities given by them for the faithful discharge of the trust reposed in them: 2. An account of all sums of money issued to each and to every of the army agents, by way of compensation for his trouble in the affairs of the different regiments of which he has the management, and for any other public expences, from the 25th of Dec. 1805, to the 24th of Dec. 1806; specifying the several heads of service for which the compensation is granted: 3. An account of all sums of money advanced monthly to the army agents for subsistence, &amp;c. for what period these payments are made in advance, and the names of the agents: 4. An account of the expence for agency attending the 26 articles of the abstract of the army estimates for this year, presented to this house on the 14th of January, the names of the agents entitled to receive the same, and the amount paid to each agent: 5. A statement of the mode of issuing the funds applicable to the Volunteer service through the office of the agent-general, with an account of the expence of that establishment from the 1st of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0428"/>
<col>811</col>
June 1803, to the 1st of Jan. 1805; specifying the different heads under which the same has been issued: 6. Statement of the sums expended in Great Britain for the Volunteer service between the 1st day of June 1803, and the 1st day of Jan. 1805; specifying particularly how much has been applied to the following heads, viz. attendance at drill, inspection, permanent duty, also of drill serjeants, adjutants, serjeantsmajor, inspecting field-officers, brigadier-generals, majors of brigade, aides-de-camp, &amp;c. and clothing: 7. An account of all sums of money to which the regiments of the line are entitled for clothing, from the 25th of Dec. 1804, to the 24th of Dec. 1805; specifying the number of regiments: 8. A return of the number of effective non-commissioned officers and privates, on the strength of the regiments of the line from the 25th of Dec. 1804, to the 24th of Dec. 1805: 9. A return of the number of effective officers of each rank on the strength of the regiments of the line, from the 25th of Dec. 1804, to the 24th of Dec. 1805."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the production of the papers, farther than that the subjects they alluded to were now under the consideration of the commissioners of military enquiry, who would shortly report upon it. The subjects were certainly most important, and the attention of the war-office and of his majesty's government were particularly directed to them, with a view to make every practicable saving for the public. Under the circumstances of the commission of military enquiry having directed its investigation to the matter, and of its being necessary to go to a considerable expence for clerks to make out the accounts, he put it to the hon. gent. whether it would be desirable to press the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>was confident that by adopting the plan of clothing now in use with respect to the invalids, a saving of from 100,000<i>l</i>. to 160,000<i>l</i>. would be practicable on the sum now expended on the clothing of the army, which was from 800,000<i>l</i>. to 1,000,000<i>l</i>. A plan, suggested by the paymaster-general, was under the consideration of his majesty's government, with the approbation of his royal highness the commander-in-chief, for taking the clothing out of the hands of the colonels, allowing them a liberal compensation for the advantages they now derived from it. This arrangement would be more satisfactory to the colonels,
<col>812</col>
at the same time that it would be highly beneficial to the public. With respect to the Agency department, that too had been under consideration: but it was to be feared, that no considerable saving could be made in it, by establishing a general agency office, at least none sufficient to compensate the great convenience that was felt from having agents chosen by the colonels themselves. He submitted to the hon. gent. the propriety of waiting for the report of the commissioners of military enquiry. If that report should not go as far as the hon. gent. wished, he might move any further step he may think proper.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>thought it best to leave these matters to the commissioners of military enquiry in the first instance. Both subjects, the clothing and the agency, had engaged much of the consideration of the late government, with a view to the practicability of some savings upon them. His inclination was very much in favour of the plan mentioned by the right hon. gent. opposite, and that not so much with a view to economy, though that important object also would be promoted, as in order to take the colonels of regiments out of the incongruous situation in which they were placed while suffered to act as clothiers to their respective corps. With respect to agency, that matter had been under consideration so long since, as when he had been in the war office, and the result of the deliberation was, that no saving could be made by the adoption of a general plan, sufficient to compensate the loss of the convenience now afforded by the nomination of his own agent by every commander of a regiment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>saw the strongest reason for the production of the papers in the avowal of so many official persons, that the subject to which he called the attention of the house, admitted, at least, in a considerable degree, of reform; and that such reform, though many years in contemplation, was still not carried into effect. Probably, if he should omit to bring the matter before the house now, it would remain still to be said, after the lapse of some more years, that the reform was under consideration.&#x2014;&#x2014;After some further observations from the secretary at war, who said the saving even on the clothing, would not be so considerable as some expected; Mr. Windham who said, it was not so much to saving he looked, as to correcting the incongruity of making the colonels clothiers; and Mr. Huskisson, who said that only a small proportion of the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0429"/>
<col>813</col>
20,000,000<i>l</i>. expended on the army, went through the hands of the agents, the whole sum that could with possibility be retrenched in this department, being at the utn.ost 67,000<i>l</i>.; the papers were ordered.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SINKING FUND.] Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for going into a committee on the bill for the appropriation of the Sinking Fund. He would reserve his observations till he should have heard the sentiments of the right hon. gent. opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>contended, that it was improper and unnecessary to adopt this measure, or to come to any resolution upon it in the present session. He allowed that great benefit had been derived from the pause in taxation introduced with this measure; but, in considering the further adoption of that repose in any future session, it would be proper to consider how far it was checked by being burthened with an increased Sinking Fund of five per cent. The measure had been already adopted so far as was requisite for the ways and means of this year. What it would be fit to do at a future period, would be best determined by future circumstances. This measure proposed to compel the public creditor to receive an advanced sinking fund on a small part of the debt now, as a consideration for being deprived of the growing accumulation of the whole sinking fund at a future period. By the act of 1792, it was provided, that unless parliament should establish other funds to pay the public debt, at farthest in 45 years, one per cent. should be set aside for that purpose at the Exchequer, so that it must be paid, at all events, in 45 years. The present measure, therefore, in making an arrangement to pay off the debt in 45 years. gave the public creditor the very worst repayment that by law he was entitled to. The precedent of lord Sidmouth's interference with the Sinking Fund, by no means went to bear out this measure. When lord Sidmouth, in funding 97,000,000<i>l</i>. at the close of the last war, made a new arrangement of the Sinking Fund, taking advantage of its produce for that time for the immediate exigency, the public creditor was compensated by giving up the surplus over 4,000,000<i>l</i>. a year, which would become applicable to the current service in 1808. Here there was no compensation whatsoever. He entered into a variety of statements to prove, that, by the plan of the noble lord, the most distinct disadvantage would accrue to the public, if they could allow themselves to be deluded by it. He
<col>814</col>
deeply regretted that the expectation had been raised in the country, that during the period of war no greater annual loan would be required than 11 millions, an expectation which there was not the slightest possibility of being realized. He concluded by hoping that the house would not come to any decision on the subject, but leave it in an unprejudged state for the consideration of another session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member> <membercontribution>replied to the chancellor of the exchequer, and asked, how he could call upon the house to defer its opinion on a measure which was contingent on another which had been passed by the legislature, and received the pointed approbation of the king? All that was implied in the resolutions which he intended to propose was, that the house should express its determination that, if the boon should continue for the time proposed, then a benefit would be expected in return. He was not prepared to say that it would be of very material import if these resolutions should be postponed until next sessions; but then the same arguments that were now urged, might be advanced in favour of longer delay, and so on, until the house and the country felt the inconvenience of no legislative regulation having been agreed to sooner. The act of 1802 had been spoken of, but he would ask, did not the legislature then act for the advantage of the public creditor, without ridiculously waiting until the individuals that composed that body should petition the house to interfere in their behalf? The principle upon which the sinking fund was raised, was, it was true, then broken in upon; but it was for the advantage of the public. An advantage to a greater extent would be reaped from the present system; it was by a regard to the security of the public creditor, and a seasonable attention to his interest; it was by public security, and the facility of disposing of property in our funds that an immense capital was drawn into the service of the public. It was said, that the proposer of these resolutions only accelerated the disorder in order that he might apply the remedy; but it was not right that regulations should be adopted for general supply, so as to prevent any sudden emergency hereafter. Would any man wish to get rid of a plan for the better supplying of this metropolis with provisions, merely because we did not want provisions at present? He did not say that exactly the same individuals would hold the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0430"/>
<col>815</col>
stock at each time; but still a certain general good would be effected. It was certain that a proportion of stock, amounting to the value specified, would be paid off in a given period. It was said, however, that contingencies were not provided for, as it was seen that there was a vote of credit for 3 millions last year. The different items, however, of which that sum was composed, were expressly stated, and the house was then satisfied with the statement. In fact, it never was asserted that the system which was now to be proposed, would cover every extraordinary contingency, such as subsidies, arrears of subsidy, &amp;c. But by the plan, as has been already stated, a certain sum will assuredly be paid off in a given time: and if ever there was a time when economy was to be looked to particularly, it was the present, (not economy as to abuses, for in that they were all agreed,) but economy as to the general management of the affairs of the public, and a serious consideration as to whatever would most tend to maintain the public credit. The country would, if these resolutions were adopted, be relieved from considerably increasing burthens for the present, and look forward with certain hope as to the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>contended that the taking from the Sinking Fund, even at the end of ten years, would be diminishing the security which the public creditor now held; and he considered that it would be in the highest degree absurd to declare now, that in ten years we would take from the Sinking Fund, when it was absolutely impossible to foresee the state of the country in ten years, whether it would be at peace or at war, or whether it might not be necessary then to add to the Sinking Fund, instead of taking any thing away from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dent</member> <membercontribution>expressed his opinion, that so long as we were able to raise taxes sufficient to pay the interest of our loans, there was no necessity for the plan of the noble lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Addington</member> <membercontribution>defended the conduct of his noble relation (lord Sidmouth). There were some gentlemen who, if they disapproved of his conduct at the time that was alluded to, disapproved of it <i>sub silentio</i>. He thought it really somewhat extraordinary that some gentlemen should approve of what was said to give a breathing time to taxation, and yet not approve of the resolutions that were to be moved in support of that system.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Long</member> <membercontribution>declared, that he had entertainer strong objections to the measure of the no-
<col>816</col>
ble lord in 1802, though he had deferred to the opinion of his late right hon. friend. He saw no reason for pressing the proposition of the noble lord opposite, this session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Davies Giddy</member> <membercontribution>was so convinced of the radical truth of the noble lord's original propositions, that if he now pressed his motion, he should support it. At the same time, he saw not the utility of proposing the motion, when it was not likely to be acted upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Vansittart</member> <membercontribution>defended the plan of his noble friend, and thought that the time for requiring of the public creditors any sacrifice was, when they had an advantage from the augmentation that had been made this year to the sinking fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose </member>, <membercontribution>though he had entertained considerable doubts as to the measure adopted in 1802, had yet got rid of those doubts in consequence of the circumstances under which it had been brought forward. The plan of the noble lord was founded upon an accumulating debt, and a decreasing Sinking Fund, but the original plan of his late right hon. friend was founded upon an increasing Sinking Fund, and a decreasing Debt.&#x2014;The question was then put for going into the committee, and negatived without a division.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[ROMAN CATHOLIC COLLEGE AT MAYNOOTH.]</member> <membercontribution>The house having resolved itself into a committee of supply,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Foster </member>, <membercontribution>in moving that the sum of 13,000<i>l</i>. be granted for defraying the expences of the Roman Catholic seminary at Maynooth in Ireland, entered into a statement on the subject. The additional sum of 5000<i>l</i>. by which double the usual number of Catholic clergy would be educated at Maynooth, had been voted by the last parliament, on the recommendation of the late administration. On enquiry, it had been found that a considerable part of that sum had already been advanced; that the buildings were in a great state of forwardness, and that if therefore the vote was now reduced to its original state, the 8000<i>l</i>. would be very much infringed upon by these circumstances. It was on this account that he now proposed the sum of 13,000<i>l</i>. to be voted for these purposes; but he begged to be understood, as by no means pledging himself to repeat such a proposition in any succeeding year.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Elliot</member> <membercontribution>defended the conduct of the late administration, in having recommended to parliament the adoption of this grant of 13,000<i>l</i>. founded on a petition, and expedient in every point of view, more especially when the present state of the continent, by which the Catholics of Ireland were precluded from obtaining education abroad, was considered. But, even were the continent in a different situation, were it practicable for the Catholics to go over and receive a foreign education, it seemed to him to be a question easily decided, whether it would not be infinitely more wise and politic to afford them the same facilities at home. He trusted, therefore, notwithstanding the intimation of the right hon. gent., that parliament would not in future refuse that which it was on all hands agreed at present should be voted for Catholic instruction in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<col>818</col>
<p><member>Mr. Hawkins Browne</member> <membercontribution>thought his right hon. friend (Mr. Foster) had acted, on this occasion, with great liberality and moderation. He said, if he had been a member of the Irish parliament, he never would have given his assent to establish such an anomaly as a college maintained within the realm, at the expence of the state, to educate a clergy for the purpose of propagating a religion contrary and hostile to the state itself; a religion which every member of that house was bound to abjure, before he could take his seat; a religion of superstitious, intolerant, and persecuting principles, and which, however friendly he was to toleration and liberty of conscience, he was sorry to find so inveterately rooted amongst so great a portion of the people of Ireland, and now cherished by the sanction of law. He lamented extremely, that there were so many Roman Catholics in Ireland, and would have no objection to agree to the establishment of parish schools for their education, in common with Protestants; not like the Protestant charter-schools, to procure proselytes, but where they might be instructed in the fundamental principles of Christianity, in which all sects agree. But if the Irish Catholics wished to educate their clergy, let them do it like the Protestant dissenters, at their own cost, instead of loading the Protestants of Ireland with taxes for the purpose of supporting a college on their account.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>did not expect that such a discussion would have arisen on this subject at this moment; but since it was part of a settled plan of the present government, and the hon. gent. had taken the lead, he should hold it right to follow the ship of the line, and get into deep water. The hon. gent. had expressed his astonishment at the existence of such an anomaly as a Catholic college, for the education of a Catholic priesthood, maintained by government in the midst of Ireland, a Protestant state. The best answer to this was, that the case of Ireland itself was an anomaly, where three-fourths of the people continued Catholics, notwithstanding all the legal cruelties, proscriptions, and privations for so many hundred years, in order to grind them into Protestants. Was it because they refused to become proselytes to Protestantism, contrary to the conviction of their consciences, that they were to have no religion at all? If they would continue Catholics, was it not better for the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0432"/>
<col>819</col>
state that they should be good, enlightened and loyal Catholics, than be left to ignorance, barbarism, or disaffection, under the tuition of priests educated in a hostile country, of whose principles, or whose fitness to instruct the king's subjects, government knew nothing? Was it not better the Irish Catholic priesthood should be men educated under the very eye of government, and be of known character, attached to their native land, than men who imbibed their education and their political principles under the auspices of an enemy? But notwithstanding all that the hon. gent. had said of the gross superstition and barbarism of the Irish Catholics, he conceived it was no more than the gross religion of a gross class of people, and not one whit more so than that of a very great portion of the Protestants of England; and he begged leave to say, that, from every thing he could hear or experience, the enlightened and educated Catholics of this country and of Ireland were not inferior in principles, in virtue, or talents, to any other description of men any where. There was nothing half so barbarous, even in the imputed superstition and intolerance of the lowest of the Irish Catholics, as the cry of "no popery!" so recently set on foot throughout this country, by certain gentlemen amongst those opposite to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Parnell</member> <membercontribution>said, he held in his hand the Prayer Book used by the Roman Catholics in Ireland, out of which, with the permission of the house, he would read a few extracts, for the purpose of shewing that the doctrines attributed to that body of men were either misunderstood or grossly misrepresented. He accordingly read the following sections of that Book:&#x2014;"2. It is no matter of faith that the church cannot err either in matters of fact, or in matter of speculation or civil policy depending on mere human reason, these not being divine revelations deposited in the Catholic church." "3. If a General Council, much less a Papal Consistory, should presume to depose a king and to absolve his subjects from their allegiance, no Catholic could be bound to submit to such decree." Hence it follows, "4. That subjects of the king of England lawfully may, without the least breach of any Catholic principle, renounce upon oath the teaching or practising the doctrine of deposing kings excommunicated for heresy by any authority whatsoever, as repugnant to the fundamental laws of the nation, as injurious to sovereign power, and as destructive to peace and good government." "6. It is
<col>820</col>
no matter of faith to believe that the Pope is himself infallible." "7. Nor do Catholics, is Catholics, believe that the Pope has any direct or indirect authority over the temporal powers and jurisdiction of princes. Hence, if the Pope should pretend to absolve or dispense his majesty's subjects from their allegiance on account of heresy or schism, such dispensation should be vain and null, and all Catholic subjects, notwithstanding such dispensation or absolution, should be still bound in conscience to defend their king and country at the hazard of their lives and fortunes (as far as Protestants would be bound), even against the Pope himself, should he invade the nation." "9 As for the king-killing doctrine, or murder of princes excommunicated for heresy, it is universally admitted in the Catholic church, and expressly so declared in the council of Constance, that such doctrine is impious and execrable, being contrary to the known laws of God and nature." "11. It is a fundamental truth in our religion, that no power on earth can license men to lie, to forswear or perjure themselves, to massacre their neighbours, or destroy their native country, on pretence of promoting the Catholic cause or religion. Furthermore, all pardons or dispensations granted, or pretended to be granted, in order to any such ends or designs, could have no other validity or effect than to add sacrilege and blasphemy to the above-mentioned crimes." The book from which he had read these extracts, the hon. member assured the house, was in as general use and circulation in Ireland, and was held in equal respect and veneration as the Common Prayer Book of England was in this country. He had quoted them for the purpose of shewing, that the Roman Catholics of Ireland did not maintain any principles contrary to the constitution of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. William Smith</member> <membercontribution>thought that, in an anomalous government, like that of Ireland, a Protestant government, taking from the large body of the Catholics all the tithes of the country, was at least bound to provide instruction for those Catholics. He thought it most expedient and politic, were it to be argued on that ground alone, that the instruction of the Catholics should be in the hands of the government. Adverting to the doctrines contained in the prayer-book, extracts from which had just been read by an hon. gent., he contended that if sincere in those doctrines, Catholics were entitled to hold any offices of trust. If they
<image src="S1V0009P0I0433"/>
<col>821</col>
were not supposed to be sincere, it would indeed be unsafe to rely upon them, even in social intercourse. The word "toleration" had been very much abused on this subject; and he protested against the false and unfounded idea which it had been attempted to convey by it, that those granting toleration were superior to those to whom it had been granted. He adverted to the conduct of Catharine de Medecis, two centuries ago, who was herself a most intolerant persecutor, and the author of the massacre of St. Bartholomew; yet her last advice to her son and successor was, to establish amongst his subjects freedom of religion. She had tried persecution in vain, was convinced of her error, and fully persuaded that differences in religion could never be settled by force. What was now done, was wise and prudent; and it would be still more wise and prudent, if the present administration would resolve to do the same again, at a future period, and with a better grace.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>protested against the entertaining of any such belief as that he wished to withhold instruction from the Roman Catholics of Ireland. All he wished to do was, to protect the Protestants against the increased and increasing influence of the priesthood. He confessed he had opposed the extension of this grant during the last parliament. But he now thought it better, as he believed he was the only person in his majesty's government who had seriously opposed it, to accede to the proposition of his hon. friend, lest his opposition should appear the effect of spleen, in endeavouring to make this the only exception from the acceding to the grants of the last parliament. He believed, however, the present was the first instance in which the house, on the application of the party alone, without any investigation in a committee, had granted such an increase as was proposed during the last parliament. Had the house gone into a committee, was it possible it could have come to the resolution of extending the Romish priests in Ireland to double their present number? Was this the way to extend the Protestant religion in that country? Only 100 Protestant clergy were educated there annually, yet it was proposed to raise the number of Catholic priests to four times that number. The hon. member for Norwich (W. Smith) had talked as if these priests had been under the care of government. This was a
<col>822</col>
mistake. All that government had to do in the matter was, to bear the expence of the establishment. He submitted, that if this establishment was to be increased, the least thing which could be done was, to give government some say in the institution, that they might know the manner in which the studies were conducted; have the nomination of the professors; or, at least, in some shape or other, know that they were not educating a society of Jesuits, who would not be suffered to exist in any other part of Europe. We ought to know, that the foreigners who might be employed in this seminary were not in actual hostilty to us, and that they were not likely to instil principles inimical to us into the minds of those whom they were called on to instruct. He, on the whole, could not help thinking, that in increasing the establishment in question, we were not only sowing the seeds of continuance for the Catholic religion in Ireland, but, in fact, were doing what we could to root the Protestant religion out of that country. The students of the Protestant church, as he had already said, only amounted to 100 yearly; those educated by this eleemosynary institution to the Catholic persuasion, already amounted to 200; and it was proposed to double them, or to make them amount to four times the number of the Protestant students, thereby giving the Catholic religion a four-fold advantage over the Protestant.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>said, if a Roman Catholic establishment in Ireland was allowed, they must have an education; and the question was, whether that education should be in Ireland, or out of it; or whether they should have any education at all? If not educated in Ireland, the priests would go abroad for education, where they would meet with tenets more dangerous to our constitution. The house would recollect, a priesthood must exist in Ireland, and that it would be best under the encouragement and observation of government than under any other. The right hon. gent. had talked as if they were shut up from the knowledge of government; but surely he knew there were five visitors appointed by act of parliament, one of whom was the lord chancellor of Ireland, who were to make a visitation once in three years, or at any time on the requisition of the lord lieutenant; and, if they did their duty, could it be supposed the establishment was not under the controul of government?
<image src="S1V0009P0I0434"/>
<col>823</col>
The arguments of the right hon. gent. that there were only 100 teachers of the Protestant religion in the University of Dublin, while there were 200 Roman Catholic priests in the College of Maynooth, went to nothing but to strike a balance of ignorance; for, if there were not enough to teach the Protestants, it was no reason there should not be enough to teach the Roman Catholics; they should rather enlarge the Protestant teachers, than restrain or diminish the others, and let the education be open and manly, and not clandestine and mysterious, as it had formerly been. If the right hon. gent. had wanted information, he ought to have called for it, by a motion, last session, when he opposed this measure. [The chancellor of the exchequer said across the table, that he had called for this information, though not by motion.]&#x2014;Lord H. Petty resumed. It was extraordinary on a subject connected with the national expenditure, that the right hon. gent. had not made a distinct motion. There was no paucity of the means of education for the Protestant Clergy of Ireland. There was Trinity College in Dublin, one of the most splendid establishments of the kind that existed, besides the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. At any rate, if the means of instructing Protestant clergy for Ireland were deemed too small, let not the means of instructing the Roman Catholic clergy therefore suffer; let it not be a contest which class should be kept in the greater ignorance, but let it be rather an emulation how to diffuse over the whole country, the greatest possible civilization and instruction.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. J. Leslie Foster</member> <membercontribution>(member for the university of Dublin) hoped, that after the allusion that had been made by the noble lord to the place he had the honour to represent, he would be excused saying a few words on the subject now before the committee. Of the establishment of Maynooth College, as a substitution for St. Omer's, he entirely approved. He did not himself remember the circumstances under which it was originally founded; but believed, from what he had heard, that 8000<i>l</i>. annually were voted for the maintenance of 200 students, and 200 only. The principals of that college had, however, now come forward, and asked of parliament 5000<i>l</i>. in addition, for the erection of buildings sufficient to lodge 200 students more. This he could not help thinking was in effect to do no less than double the establishment.
<col>324</col>
As to the Dublin seminary, the excellent system of learning adopted there, had certainly induced a number of the Catholic gentry to send their sons to that college. He believed the number of Roman Catholic students considerably above forty. Those young gentlemen pursued the same course of studies for four years with their Protestant fellow students, and in returning to their family had a more friendly, liberal, and just idea of what a Protestant was, than they originally had, or perhaps could have otherwise obtained. At the same time, that college would not forget the origin and nature of its institution. The gentlemen on the opposite benches were, he was sure, too well versed in Irish history, not to know that the Dublin College was founded upon Protestant principles, by Elizabeth, and for the growth and dissemination of the Protestant religion. It was, in fact, a Protestant garrison in a land of Catholics; and the learned and respectable characters at the head of the government of that college, had uniformly acted up to the true spirit of its institution. In the reign of James II., the stand that college made for her civil and religious liberties, would remain upon honourable record, and the late spirit of religious moderation that induced her to forbear from taking any part in the disputes of the day, proved that she could forget her resentments as well as remember her obligations.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dillon</member> <membercontribution>read from a document he held in his hand, a statement of the number of sinecure livings in Ireland, without glebe houses or residences, by which, he contended, it appeared that the Roman Catholics paid one-tenth of their property to a nominal clergy for doing nothing. He said, it was no wonder that the Protestant church was disrelished by the Irish peasant, when the only way through which he knew it was, the exactions of the tithe-proctor. He concluded with an earnest exhortation to the house, to adopt some modification of tithes in Ireland, as the best possible way of restoring the people of that country to content.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>defended the way in which the grant had been introduced, and asked, why that mode had not been altered by the right hon. gent. (Mr. Foster), since it had been condemned by his colleague the chancellor of the exchequer for England? He was glad he had the authority of the member for Dublin college bearing him out in the assertion made by him in that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0435"/>
<col>825</col>
house, in the former parliament, and which the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Perceval) did not then seem inclined to credit. There were three reasons for encouraging the education of the Roman Catholics in Ireland: One, that great lucrative objects were withheld from the Roman Catholics, which were the greatest incentives in the education of the Protestant. Another was, that the Roman Catholics were the poorest order, and therefore had a claim on the government to promote their education, because they were notable to support their own pastors. And a third was, that Oxford and Cambridge which were open to the Protestants, were shut against the Roman Catholics; besides, Irish viceroys, in the plenitude of their bounty, took good care to carry over to that country a generous supply of clergy, who were soon provided for on the Irish establishment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer </member>, <membercontribution>in answer to what had fallen from an hon. member (Mr. Dillon), assured that hon. gent. that the attention of government should be early and anxiously directed to the abuse complained of, with respect to the want of glebe houses, and sinecure livings. He did think with that hon. gent. that it was extremely hard, that any man should pass away an indolent life upon an opulent living, while a poor curate was discharging the duties of that office for the year round, upon a pittance scarcely sufficient to maintain him. He had before failed in two or three instances, in carrying through that house a measure for the regulation of rectories and cures; he however now gave notice that it was the intention of his majesty's present government to submit to the consideration of the house, a measure for reducing the opulent livings, and out of their abundance making an allowance for the poorer curates. It ought to have been done before; he wished that the late government had paid more attention to the church in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>did not mean to protract the debate, nor should he now have risen to offer any thing by way of argument on a subject that had been so ably argued on both sides of the house, had it not been that he could not sit still after the imputation thrown upon the late government by the right hon. gent. He challenged the right hon. gent. to state an instance in which the late government had neglected the church in that country. He desired the right hon. gent. to ask the primate of
<col>826</col>
that country, what he thought of the duke of Bedford's administration as to that head? He desired the right hon. gent. to look into the secretary of state's office for the home department, and there he would see the documents that would prove how far the late ministers were guilty of negligence, with respect to Ireland; but such a charge carried with it all that boldness of assertion for which that right hon. gent. was so characteristic. The noble lord then adverted to the conduct of another right hon. gent. (Mr. Foster) in coming before the house so totally unprepared, without having made the previous enquiries when he was in Ireland, and which he might have made as visitor of Maynooth college, a conduct that appeared to him to evince a culpable carelessness and levity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Foster</member> <membercontribution>said, that the noble lord had charged him with levity. He asked that noble lord if there was a document to produce to the house which could substantiate the claim now made upon it, and if there was not, he would say that the noble lord, in charging him with levity, had been guilty not only of levity but ignorance. He contended that no such document could be found.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>did not think the right hon. gent. could satisfy the house of his diligence in office by evading the charge of negligence, in resorting to such pitiful excuses.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Foster</member> <membercontribution>would not call such language unparliamentary, but he would pronounce it pitiful.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>left it to the house to determine: the right hon. gent. had said, he could not find any document. He then said, he did not say he had made any enquiry; and he now said, that he did not say, he had not made an enquiry: if such was to be the candour and intelligence of the Irish chancellor of the exchequer, he could not congratulate that country on the appointment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Barry</member> <membercontribution>said a few words against the policy of continuing the grant in future. He had been present at all the former debates on the subject and had not heard of these documents. He disapproved of the wanton and unprovoked asperity with which the noble lord had treated his right hon. friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>congratulated the late administration on the honourable testimony they had received from the gentleman who had just sat down: that gentleman had been present at all the former discussions upon
<image src="S1V0009P0I0436"/>
<col>827</col>
this subject, yet such was his confidence in the virtue of the late ministers, that he never once felt himself called upon to deliver his sentiments upon the present subject: [A laugh:] but now when men had succeeded, for whom they both felt such a distrust, his patriotic jealousy at once put an end to that silent and according acquiescence to the judgments and sentiments of honester men.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Barry</member> <membercontribution>said, that certainly the diligent and punctual attendance of his right hon. friend to his parliamentary duties, in the last sessions, [a laugh,] enabled him to remember accurately all that then passed in that house. Unfortunately, however, he (Col. B.) had spoken on that subject, though he did not expect, nor indeed, did it appear, that it had made any great impression on his right non, friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said in answer, that if he had not been as vigilant and anxious in his attention to his parliamentary duties during the last sessions as he usually was, it was owing to nothing but his unbounded confidence in the late administration. [A laugh.]</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Duigenan</member> <membercontribution>denied that the late administration had manifested any solicitude to promote the interests of the Protestant religion in Ireland. On the contrary, he had to state that a bill which he introduced, at the instance of several of the archbishops and bishops of Ireland, to enforce the residence of the clergy, and which bill was a transcript of that brought forward in this country by sir W. Scott, was discountenanced by that administration, and in consequence rejected. What the administration to which he referred had done for the benefit of the established church in Ireland, he had yet to learn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>had no idea that the disinclination of the late government to countenance a measure brought forward by the learned doctor was likely to depreciate the character of that government, either in England or Ireland. Therefore he did not think it necessary to make any attempt at vindicating himself or his colleagues against the learned doctor's accusation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>observed, that gentlemen, in asserting the sufficiency of a certain number of clergymen to administer the duties of the Catholic religion in Ireland, because such a number was thought necessary in 1795, seemed altogether to exclude the consideration of those events which had since occurred on the continent, which events limited the supplies from that quarter, and
<col>828</col>
also appeared to forget the growing population of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>thought it remarkable, that while the gentlemen on the other side agreed to the resolution, they pursued a course of argument directly against it. Their argument, indeed, would militate not only against the proposed increase of the institution, but against its original establishment. The principle of the original establishment was to provide the means of educating and domesticating the Catholic clergy of Ireland, and thus to protect them from the opportunity of imbibing foreign principles. With that view, the college of Maynooth was instituted, and the state of the continent at the time rendered such an institution peculiarly necessary. Did any alteration take place in the state of the continent to abate the amount or character of that University? It was absurd to say, that the same number of Roman Catholic clergymen would suffice for Ireland now, that was thought requisite in 1795; for that would be to suppose the population at a stand, and nothing could be imagined more absurd than to suppose that 200 clergymen would be sufficient. There were no less than 2400 parishes and 1100 benefices in Ireland; and if so many clergymen were appointed to instruct one million of Protestants, or rather half that number, for the other half at least of those denominated Protestants belonged to the different classes of dissenters, how could 200 clergymen be considered competent to perform the ecclesiastical duties of Catholicity to three millions of people? The idea was preposterous. And as to the expence, the Catholics were generally unable to educate their clergy, and they must be educated at the public expence, or they must be ignorant and a disgrace to Christianity. The expence was trifling, and the object was material. Would any friend to toleration in common policy starve religion to save the treasury 5000<i>l</i>.?&#x2014;The right hon. gent. animadverted in terms peculiarly emphatical upon the statements of those who dwelt upon what they called the uncivilized state of Ireland. Some indeed, said the right hon. gent., affect to say that the great body of the Irish people are mere savages. I will not defend the Irish against such a charge, but I will defend you. If Ireland, after having been so many centuries connected with you, has not learned enough at least to rescue it from the savage state, while the world has been progressively improving, its connection with
<image src="S1V0009P0I0437"/>
<col>829</col>
your country has not been a blessing, but a nuisance. I will never hear, added the right hon. gent., any reflection upon the morals or manners of my country without rising to resist it. I shall always protest against any reflections upon a country to which I owe so much&#x2014;to which you owe so much&#x2014;which is still ready to serve you, and from which, I trust, you will continue to derive the most active and ardent support.&#x2014;The resolution was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

A new writ was then ordered for Midhurst.&#x2014;Mr. Hobhouse reported from the committee, to whom the resolution of the house of the 11th day of Feb. 1789, respecting the Recognizances to be entered into by any person having presented a petition to this house, complaining of an undue election, was referred; that the committee had come to the following resolution; "That, so far as the said resolution respects the notice required to be given by the petitioner to the sitting member or members, or their known agent or agents, of the time and place of the intended examination of the sufficiency of the surety or sureties to be named in any recognizance, and of the names, additions, and places of abode of such sureties, if the petitioner shall not have been able to find and serve the sitting member or his known agent or agents, and if he shall thereupon have obtained an order from the house enlarging the time for entering into his recognizance, it shall be sufficient for the petitioner to give the said notice in writing, seven days at least previous to such examination, to the clerk of the house of commons, who shall enter the same in a book to be kept for that purpose, which shall be open to the inspection of all persons concerned."

<p><member>[BREACH OF PRIVILEGE&#x2014;COMPLAINT RESPECTING THE POOLE WRIT.] Mr. Jeffery</member>, <membercontribution>pursuant to notice, rose to call the attention of the house to a circumstance, which was not only a violation of law, but a high breach of the privileges of that house. On the 29th of April, the writs were issued, as he understood, for the general election, and amogst the other writs, one for the election of Burgesses to serve in parliament for the town and county of the town of Poole. He had been informed by the messenger of the great seal, that this writ had been delivered immediately by him to Mr. Jonathan Brundrett, chief clerk to Mr. Lowten, in the Temple, to be sent to the sheriff of Poole. When he called upon Mr. Lowten, to enquire whether the writ had been sent, he was informed, that it had been sent three hours before; and on asking to whom the writ had been sent, he received a rude answer declining to state to whom, and accompanied with an observation, that it had been sent down in opposition to himself. It was not till the 20th of May that the sheriff gaveno tice, that the election would be held on the 25th of May, and in consequence, sir Richard Bickerton, one of the lords of the admiralty, and himself, who had gone down to Poole when the writs were issued, expecting that the election would come on immediately, with several of the electors of that city, were detained there three weeks to their great inconvenience. He should not detain the house by dwelling upon the motives of the conduct of which he complained, but should only state, that as parties ran high in the town, and the numbers were nearly balanced, the delay had been resorted to, in order to give an opportunity to one person, who would not have been of age to vote till the 22d of May, time to attain the proper age to vote. The consequence was a special return with respect to the two other
<image src="S1V0009P0I0438"/>
<col>831</col>
candidates; he having been the only person actually returned. He should not trouble the house farther at present, on the subject, than by moving, that Mr. Stainforth, messenger of the great seal, who was attending in the lobby, should be called to the bar, to be examined relative to the business.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Creevey</member> <membercontribution>wished to know what breach of privilege the hon. member complained of.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>said, it was his duty to answer that question. Undoubtedly, any person who detained a writ issued for the election of a member of that house, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour, the highest which that house knew, because such conduct had the effect of keeping the representatives of the people,who ought to be in the house, for the time, out of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Stainforth</member> <membercontribution>was then brought to the bar, and stated, that he had received the writ for Poole a little after twelve o'clock, on the 30th of April, and delivered it within less than two hours after to Mr. Brundrett, chief clerk of Mr. Lowten, for the purpose of being forwarded with all possible expedition to the sheriff of Poole. Mr. Stainforth then withdrew, and Mr. T. Lowten and Mr. Jonathan Brundrett were ordered to attend the house to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[VOLUNTEERS.] Sir Thomas Turton</member>, <membercontribution>in rising to make his motion, in pursuance of his notice, for a return of the effective strength of the Volunteers, felt it impossible not to participate in the satisfaction of the house and of the public, that a noble lord, whom he did not then see in his place, was to-morrow to bring forward a proposition in which this part of the national force would be adequately provided for. There was a return similar to that he wished to call for before the house, presented in December last, but as he knew that it was inaccurate with respect to three or four regiments, he was sorry that it could not be seen from it how far it was to be depended on. It was peculiarly desirable, in the present situation of the country, to know what was the effective strength of its Volunteer force; as it was not to be concealed that that force had greatly decreased in consequence of the discouragements which it had met with. He was convinced, however, that the Volunteers were sound at heart, and that, with a little encouragement, they would again fall into their ranks; and, in the present state of the country, they should look to the Volunteers principally for the defence of the country. He should conclude by moving,
<col>832</col>
that there be laid before the house a return of the effective strength of the Volunteer force of Great Britain and Ireland, distinguishing cavalry from infantry, to the latest period to which the same can be made out.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the motion, as he thought that every information on this subject should be afforded to the house. But he apprehended that the hon. baronet would be disappointed, if he expected more accurate information in this return than in that which had been laid on the table in December last. The inspecting field-officers had then been done away, and the returns were made by the commanding officers of the corps, without any check on the part of government. These inspecting field-officers had been only just appointed; and, though they might have made returns of a few corps, the great mass of the returns, which by the law were to be made every three months, would still rest on the same authority as the returns to which the hon. bart. had alluded.<lb/>
Mr. Shaw Lefevre contended, that if any relaxation had taken place in the zeal of the Volunteers, it was because there did not appear the same occasion for their services, and that, when the enemy should again appear on the coast, they would again rally round their standards. If the Volunteers had been worked, as formerly, he was sure their numbers would have diminished. The measures of the late administration respecting them, he insisted, were wise. He felt warm on this subject, because he had commanded Volunteer corps ever since 1794, and he knew them to be attached to their sovereign and the constitution. Whilst he had a limb to stand upon, he should be found at his post, and he was persuaded the Volunteers would be found to adhere steadily to the principles upon which they associated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>replied, and contended that such discouraging language as "armed democracy," "depositaries of panic," &amp;c. which had been applied to them in parliament, had principally tended to diminish the numbers of the Volunteers. It was impossible for them, having the feelings of men, to be insensible to terms of reproach, and it required all the influence of their officers to keep them from shewing their sense of them by withdrawing from their corps. He had raised the corps he now commanded, in 1794, and had the satisfaction to state, that whatever provocation might have been given to the Volunteers, his corps had not been in-

<col>833</col>
fluenced by it.&#x2014;The motion was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[EAST-INDIA COMPANY'S BONDS BILL.] Mr. Grant</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day, for the second reading of the East-India Company's Bonds bill, On the question being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Creevey</member> <membercontribution>rose, not to negative the second reading of this bill, but to move that the second reading of it be put off, till the East-India accounts now printing, should be in the hands of members. The house was not in possession of any documents to prove the expediency of agreeing to such a measure. This was the first instance in which that house had been called upon to pass such a measure, without previous enquiry into the grounds upon which it was founded, by having the petition referred to a committee of the house to examine into its allegations. There were at present two budgets in arrear, and the last accounts of the India company, to which the house could resort for information, shewed the affairs of the company to be in a ruinous state. By these accounts it appeared, that there was an excess of above two millions in the company's foreign expenditure over their revenue, and a loss of 2,200,000<i>l</i>. in their trade at home. Under these circumstances, and whilst the company had a debt of seventeen millions at home, payable at the option of the holders, he did not think that parliament would do right to pass this bill without enquiring what means the company had of discharging, as well their former debt, as this new incumbrance. He should therefore, notwithstanding the prospect held out by the hon. director opposite, of a permanent peace, and consequent prosperity of the affairs of the company, move as an amendment, that the bill be read a second time on this day fortnight.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grant</member> <membercontribution>replied, that though the hon. member might be actuated by a desire to promote the public interest, he took the wrong course in his speech, for his arguments were founded in ignorance, not in his knowledge of the subject. The sole and simple reason for bringing forward the bill before the India accounts could be brought under the consideration of the house was, that if that course had not been taken, the bill could not be passed this session. The hon. member was aware how difficult it was to prepare the India accounts, so as that they could be presented in a form to be intelligible to the members
<col>834</col>
of that house. He was sorry to find an hon. gent. who had filled the situation lately held by that hon. member, so ignorant of the affairs of the company as to make the assertions he had done. It was true that by the accounts on the table there appeared a deficit at home of above 2,200,000<i>l</i>. which the hon. member had stated to be the amount of the company's loss on their trade, where as it had arisen from the quantity of stores and other articles which were necessarily sent out in consequence of the situation in which the company's settlements were placed. By the plan adopted in 1802 for the liquidation of the company's debt, it had been recommended to send out from Europe considerable quantities of bullion, in order to avoid the necessity of making loans on improvident terms in India. This had been done in 1803, 4, and 5; but the sums and bullion so sent had been applied to the purposes of the wars that then existed, so that no reduction of the debt had taken place. So also, when the system in India had been changed by marquis Cornwallis, considerable sums had been sent out, not for commercial purposes, but for the general expenditure of the presidencies in India. Under these circumstances, the company, though by law authorized to increase their funded stock, had applied to parliament for authority to issue bonds, and this was a much better course for the public, because, if the stock of the company should not be worth any thing, it would be irretrievable to the holders, whereas the bonds might or might not be taken at the option of the individuals who might speculate in such securities. What he had said with respect to the prospect of peace, was founded on the report made by the governor-general, and he was persuaded that the jealousies of the native powers had been extinguished by the conciliating disposition manifested towards them by our government. On all these grounds, he should vote that the bill be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>defended the statement of his hon. friend, as to the situation of the East-India company's affairs, and contended for the propriety of deferring the discussion, till the papers now printing should be in the hands of the members. He protested against the implied guarantees that would be given to the security of the bonds, without sufficient investigation of the state of the company's affairs. To issue the bonds without such a guarantee, would be to delude the public.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0440"/>
<col>835</col>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>insisted upon the propriety of waiting till the documents now printing should be before the house. The importance and extent of the measure to be proposed to-morrow, for the defence of the country, would involve details, which would, in all probability, keep parliament sitting for so long a time, as to allow full opportunity to pass this measure after ample discussion. The state of the East-India company was such, that if the house could not in this session, go into a particular investigation of the company's affairs, it ought at least to pledge itself by a resolution to do so in the next. He expatiated on the declining state of the company's investments and sales; on the increased dangers menacing our Indian possessions from the increased power of Bonaparte, whose hostile designs against our Indian empire were well known. He insisted also on the instability of the peace with the native powers in India. He was of opinion, that those who should advance money on the credit of these bonds would have a claim upon the public, if the company should prove unable to discharge them. [Certainly not, said Mr. Grant,] That was, in his opinion, at least doubtful. If the company could raise the money on its own credit, why did it come to parliament? If the sanction of parliament was necessary, it was in order to give the bonds a credit, which implied a sanction, amounting virtually to a guarantee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>defended the raising of money upon bonds, in preference to the augmentation of the company's capital, which the company was already by law entitled to make. With respect to the urgency of passing the bill soon, he believed it was strictly a private bill, and must of course be reported this day se'nnight, or fall to the ground. This, however, the house might dispense with. With respect to the state of the company's affairs, though expensive wars had brought on heavy charges, the Indian empire was as little ruined by those heavy charges, as this country was by the heavy wars it had to sustain in Europe. Neither did the failure of commercial speculations in one or two years imply absolute ruin. The West-India merchants also were under difficulties: but nobody thought of saying they were in danger of being ruined. He denied that the passing of this bill amounted to a guarantee on the part of parliament. It might as well be argued, that parliament would
<col>836</col>
be guarantee to the increase of the capital which the company had already power to make by act of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence </member>, <membercontribution>as a member of parliament, ignorant on this subject, and entitled to information, contended, that no farther proceedings should be had on this measure, without full inspection of such documents as could be had. There would be abundant time for this. It was generally understood that the session could not be terminated in less than five weeks.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>thought it strange, that, as this measure had been agreed to by the late board of controul, it should now be opposed by the secretary to that board (Mr. Creevey). He denied that parliament, in passing the bill, guaranteed the bonds. The present high price of the company's stock, 180 per cent., was a sufficient proof of the company's credit, and the stability of its funds, without the aid of parliament. The present discussion was, at least, a sufficient notice that parliament gave no sanction. The parliament was never supposed to sanction the West-India dock company, or any other private speculating company, when an act was passed, enabling such company to increase its capital. It was allowed on all hands, that the company wanted relief, and this was the best mode of granting that relief.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>supported the measure, and maintained the propriety of proceeding upon it without delay. The company's investments had been fully attended to. The difficulties arose from the state of the continental market, goods to the amount of 7,000,000<i>l</i>. being on hand. The territorial revenue in India, afforded a surplus of 1,000,000<i>l</i>. above the expenditure. The late wars had rendered our empire more secure against any attempt from the native powers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Morpeth</member> <membercontribution>recommended a minute investigation of the company's affairs, with a view to a complete settlement. Temporary arrangements were indeterminate and unsatisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lamb</member> <membercontribution>thought parliament bound to investigate the solvency of the parties to whom it granted power to raise money, and of course responsible in the event of these parties proving insolvent.&#x2014;The question being put, a division took place,

<date format="1807-07-17">Friday, July 17.</date>
<p><member>[IRISH GLEBE HOUSES BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The order of the day being read for the second reading of the Irish Glebe Houses bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Hardwicke</member> <membercontribution>said, he should wish the bill to be postponed for further consideration, Thursday next. He conceived the bill to be superfluous: an act having passed in the year 1803 granting the sum of 56,000<i>l</i>. the same as proposed by the present measure, for building Glebe Houses in different parts of Ireland. All, therefore, that was required, was to carry that act into execution; and it was with the view of enquiring into the causes of its having hitherto remained a dead letter, that he proposed to put off, for a few days, the second reading of the bill now on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Suffolk</member> <membercontribution>understood the reason of not executing the act passed five years ago, to be the want of sufficient securities for the due appropriation of the money. This was, however, a very unsatisfactory reason, because the clerical livings might be taken as securities. Something ought certainly to be done in the business. At a time when the extension of the privileges of the Catholics was so much objected to, surely means should be taken for spreading more generally the Protestant worship, by increasing the facilities of attendance upon it. He had no doubt that the residence of the established clergy in their respective parishes would be productive of many converts to the Protestant faith. Upon this point he could speak from a fact within his own knowledge. What was considerered the pattern regiment of the artillery at Woolwich consisted of Irish Roman Catholics, and of these, as there was not a Roman Catholic Chapel within a convenient distance, a very considerable number of them spontaneously attended the established church. Of the dissenters, very few, if any, did so: but that might arise from there being several meeting houses in the neighbourhood to which they might resort. Among the Roman Catholic troops at the dep&#x00F4;t in the Isle of Wight, he believed there were few who frequented the established church, because they had an opportunity of attending divine service at Cowes, according to their own system. Here he could not but advert to an expression which fell the other evening from high authority (the Lord Chancellor). Their lordships had been told, that the Catholics were within
<col>838</col>
the pale of the constitution. If he was rightly informed, an instance had occurred, in which the Catholic soldiers at Cowes were compelled, under threats of punishment, to attend the established church: and if such a proceeding was to be permitted, it was clear that the Catholics were not within the pale of the constitution.&#x2014;The earl of Hardwicke's motion was then put, and agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY.] The Earl of Suffolk</member> <membercontribution>then rose to state, that before he left town, on his necessary avocations, he should feel it his duty to address their lordships on the military defence of the country. He was apprehensive that the proposition to be brought forward in the other house would come before their lordships too late to admit of his delivering his sentiments upon it. He should therefore state what he had to say on Monday. He begged leave to remind the house that his advice had been followed in many of the points which he had repeatedly urged on their attention. There still, however, remained much to be done towards an efficient system of defence. He must at the same time intimate, that some of the observations which he might have to make, were of so delicate a nature, that he was apprehensive he should be under the unpleasant necessity of clearing the bar. He wished it to be under stood, that nothing but an imperious sense of duty could induce him to move for the exclusion of strangers. [Here there was a cry of order!] He was aware that he was not altogether in order, but he was unwilling that the public should conceive that he wished to conceal from them any proceeding but such as a due regard for their own interests and safety required to be kept secret.&#x2014;On Iris lordship's motion, the house was ordered to be summoned for Monday.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-07-17">Friday, July 17.</date>
<p><member>[COMPLAINT RESPECTING THE POOLE WRIT.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion of Mr. Jeffery, the house proceeded to the further consideration of the enquiry into the causes of the detention of the writ for holding the late election at Poole.&#x2014;Mr. Jonathan Brundrett being in attendance, pursuant to an order of the house, was called in and examined. He stated that he was a solicitor, acting as clerk to Mr. Lowten: that immediately after he had taken out the writ from the crown-office, he had handed it over to a gentleman who he expected would have forwarded it with, all possible expedition.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0442"/>
<col>839</col>
He professed the most respectful deference for the authority and privileges of the house, and declared, that if he had offended against either, it was altogether without intention. On being questioned more than once from whom he had received the writ, he answered, from Mr. Stainforth of the crown office. On being questioned as to the person by whom he had been employed to take out the writ, he pleaded his honourable feelings as a bar to his answering, and entreated the indulgence of the house for his silence. On this, Mr. Brundrett was ordered to withdraw.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, that when the situation, education, and character in life, of the witness were considered, his hesitation to answer the question put to him could not be imputed to mere ignorance. But as it did not become the house to take any rigorous step without explanation, he proposed that Mr. Brundrett be again called in, and that the Speaker should explain to him, that the house could not allow the ground he had laid down for refusing to answer the question put by its anthority.&#x2014;Brundrett being again called in,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>informed him, that the house did not admit the excuse he had offered, and repeated the question to him two or three times, by whom he had been employed to take out the writ? Mr. Brundrett persisted in declining to answer the question, and threw himself upon the indulgence of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>saw no option for the house in the contumacy of the witness, but to commit him to the custody of the serjeant at arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>suggested, that the first question to be put was, that Jonathan Brundrett, having refused to answer the question put to him by the authority of the house, was guilty of a high breach of privilege.&#x2014;A resolution to this effect having been put, was agreed to, <i>nem. con.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, that as the house had so unanimously declared its sense of the offence committed against its authority, by the refusal of the witness to answer, it remained for him only to follow up the unanimous resolution of the house by the usual motion in such cases. He therefore moved, that Jonathan Brundrett be, for his said offence, committed to his majesty's gaol of Newgate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>suggested, that it might he a sense a professional duty towards the person who had employed him, that had
<col>840</col>
caused the silence of tie witness: the courts of law allowed great latitude in this respect, and though the witness might have erroneously applied the principle here, some consideration was due to the habitual force of a professional obligation. It was besides a fact well known to most of the members in the house, that great exertions were in almost every case of contested election made to obtain the writ, with a view to fix the day of the election as it might suit the convenience of the party possessing it. It was a species of hypocrisy that he could not join in, to know and avow out of doors, that such a practice universally prevailed, and to cry, oh horrible! and oh monstrous! as if it was a most outrageous calumny, when such things were mentioned within doors. If the practice was felt to be in itself an abuse, or to be liable to abuse, it would be more becoming the wisdom of the house to apply a general remedy, than to punish any individual trespass with extreme severity. He thought it would be sufficient punishment to commit Mr. Brundrett to the custody of the serjeant at arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>contended for the right of the house to investigate all the proceedings with respect to the writ. If the witness persisted in his refusal to answer, he might, in so doing, be ambitious to raise his professional character; but that ambition was no reason why the house should restrain itself in the investigation which its constitution and character prescribed, nor in the exercise of the means it possessed of rendering that investigation effectual. The question was perfectly legal, and the excuse offered was totally insufficient.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>observed upon the generality of the practice of taking out writs with a view to the convenience of the parties taking them out, in giving them a discretion to fix the time of the election. Some general remedy ought to be applied. Three parliaments ago the writ for Northumberland had been offered to him, with a view that he should consult his convenience in the use of it. He declined the offer, desiring that it should be transmitted to the returning officer, and intimating that if any improper delay occurred he would complain to the house of it. He would ask the secretary of the treasury (Mr. Huskisson), if there were not other instances also of his favour in issuing the writs. When the sheriff of Westmoreland sent for the writ for the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0443"/>
<col>841</col>
borough of Appleby, for the election, by which he now held his seat, he found it was issued to another person, who used it according to his own convenience: the abuse ought to be removed by a general remedy, and not by ineffectual severity in a particular instance: Mr. Brundrett stood rather in the light of a person questioned as to his being implicated in a criminal act, than as a mere witness. If he were not a party, but questioned merely as to the crime of his employers, the professional principle ought to protect him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, the witness had already acquitted himself by immediately handing over the writ. An attorney was not protected from answering, where he himself was a party.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst and Mr. Yorke </member>, <membercontribution>on a review of all the circumstances, voted for the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>defended the treasury from the imputation of interfering with the issuing of the writs.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Ossulston</member> <membercontribution>alluded to a case, where he knew of an order being sent from the treasury not to deliver out the writ to any person in opposition to ministers, and this too at a time previous to its being known that the place was actually vacant.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>imagined the hon. secretary of the treasury would better understand the hint he had thrown about, if he enquired what had been done in the case of the writ for the university of Cambridge.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sharpe </member>, <membercontribution>from his confidence in the veracity of the hon. member (Mr. Jeffery), and from the contumacy of the witness, felt himself bound to vote for the motion of committal.&#x2014;Mr. Montague spoke to the same effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>candidly confessed, as he believed most members conversant with contested elections might do if they would, that he had himself made an arrangement to get out a writ early for the advantage of a friend of his; but, upon application, he found that the opposite party had been still more active and successful. He hoped a general remedy would be provided by an obligation to issue the writ only to the returning officer. He deprecated the severe punishment of an individual case in the present general practice. He thought a committal ought now to take place; but the, excuses that had been offered would be irresistible grounds of liberation as soon as a motion to that elect could be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>hoped this discussion would
<col>842</col>
lead to a general remedy of the evil complained of, and that not only a fair issue of writs would be the consequence, but also a fair and impartial intimation of intended dissolutions, instead of a partial communication to a favoured set after the departure of the post on a Saturday, allowing that set the advantage of a priority of two days on the canvass.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dent</member> <membercontribution>said a few words in vindication of the messenger of the great seal, the officer concerned in issuing the writs.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Smith </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation said, he did not mean to say any thing to the disadvantage of that officer; but merely to state the impropriety of the general usage in these matters as it stood at present.&#x2014;The question being put, it was ordered that Mr. Brundrett be committed to Newgate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Jeffery</member> <membercontribution>then moved, that Mr. Lowten be called in, having first stated, that on hearing at the crown office, that the writ had been taken out by Mr. Lowten's clerk, he bad gone to Mr. Lowten's chambers, who refused to tell him to whom it had been sent, but said very rudely, that it had been delivered three hours before to a person in the city, who had sent it to Poole; he would not tell to whom, but added, "if it is any satisfaction to you to know, it is gone in opposition to you."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lowten</member> <membercontribution>was then called in, and in the course of a long examination, stated, that he neither directed Brundrett to take out the writ, nor knew who did. On being asked whether, having stated to Mr. Jeffery that the writ had been sent to Poole three hours before, he had himself sent, or was privy to its being sent, by any other person? Mr. Lowten begged to know, what the hon. member meant by the word privy? On being informed that it was meant to enquire whether he had any knowledge, direct, or indirect, he said he had not; that he had merely ordered Brundrett to give it to the persons in the city who had employed him to take it out. He could not answer precisely what he had said to the hon. member; he had, he believed, said, that the writ had been sent into the city three hours before. He had not said it had been sent to Poole, at least he knew nothing of the fact of is having been so sent. The hon. member was very pertinacious, and would not take the answer thus given him, but Mr. Lowten told him he would give no other. He did not say the writ was gone, in opposition to the hon. member, his connections, or his opponents. On this difference between the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0444"/>
<col>843</col>
statement of Mr. Jeffery and Mr. Lowten, as to what passed at this interview, some questions arose as to who were present. After some remonstrances on the part of Mr. Lowten, as to the impropriety of examining who was with him upon private business, he stated, that it was Mr. Bryant, attorney, and that Mr. Jeffery was accompanied by Mr. Graves, of the same profession. Mr. Bryant was no clerk nor assistant of his. When he ordered Brundrett to give the writ to the persons who employed him in the city, he referred to Messrs. Ambrose and James Weston, attorneys. He knew no reason for their employing Brundrett to take out the writ, except that he was nearer to the crown office than they, and that he was employed to take out writs for him. When so many enquiries were afterwards made about the writ at his chambers, he thought it right to send Brundrett in person to enquire after it at Poole; Brundrett was his confidential clerk, and he was anxious to have his character set clear in the business. Mr. Lowten was then ordered to withdraw, and the farther consideration of the business was adjourned to Monday,when Mr. W. Bryant, Mr. W. Graves, Messrs. Ambrose and James Weston, were ordered to attend on the motion of Mr. Jeffery.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>moved, that the messenger of the great seal be also ordered to attend, in order to explain the circumstances relating to the issue of the writs.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>seconded the motion. He was anxious to shew, that no influence was exercised by the treasury.&#x2014;The messenger was accordingly ordered to attend on Monday.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-07-20">Monday, July 20.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. Mellish</member> <membercontribution>presented several petitions from the ministers, church-wardens, and overseers of the poor of different parishes in the city of London, against Mr. Whitbread's bill for the Education and Relief of the Poor. The petitions were respectively ordered to lie on the table till the second reading of the Poor Relief bill, and referred to the committee on the Parochial School bill. Similar petitions were presented from the magistrates of Surrey, and from different places, which were disposed of in a similar way.&#x2014;A new writ was ordered for the Borough of Winchelsea in the room of sir F. F. Vane, bart. who since his election had accepted the office of steward of the Chiltern Hundreds.&#x2014;Sir C. Pole presented a petition from R. Eyre, esq. relative to a sum of 59,000<i>l</i>. remaining unpaid of the proceeds of a Dutch Factory, captured in the year 1781, at the capture of which the petitioner commanded his majesty's sloop of war, Nymph. The petition praying a compensation out of the public money, was consented to on the part of the crown, by the chancellor of the exchequer, who did not thereby pledge himself as to what course might be afterwards adopted with respect to the petition.&#x2014; The Attorney-General brought up a bill to amend the 40th of the king, concerning the personal and other property of the king and of the Queen consort for the time being; which was read a first time.&#x2014;The Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to notice, moved for and obtained leave to bring in a bill, to continue the Commission of Military Inquiry. The bill was to continue the commission to June next, and he proposed this limit, not because he expected they could bring their labours to a close in that time, but at the desire of the commissioners, who wished that parliament should have the power of considering then, how far it might be expedient to continue the commission after that period. &#x2014;Mr. Cochrane Johnstone moved, that there be laid before the house, an account of all balances to the latest period, for or against the army agents, as far as the same could be ascertained. Also, a statement of the fund for granting pensions to the Widows of Officers, the names of the persons upon the list; the amount of the pension to each, and the time when they were placed in the list. Also, an account of the application of all sums that had been
<image src="S1V0009P0I0445"/>
<col>845</col>
granted by parliament to the compassionate list, the names of the persons on the list, the amount of allowance to each, and the times when they were respectively placed on the list. Ordered.&#x2014; The East-India Bond's bill went through a committee. After some enquiries from lord A. Hamilton, as to the grounds and objects of the measure, which were replied to by Mr. Grant, in a short statement, the same in substance with what he had said in the prior stages of the business, the report was ordered to be received on Thursday.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[BREACH OF PRIVILEGE&#x2014;COMPLAINT RESPECTING THE POOLE WRIT.] Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>stated, that he held in his hand a petition from Mr. Jonathan Brundrett, now a prisoner in Newgate, offering to answer the questions which the house might put to him, and expressing sorrow for having incurred the displeasure of the house. It happened, unfortunately, that, upon the motion of an hon. gent. (Mr. Jeffery), the further consideration of the business was postponed till Thursday. As to the case of Mr. Brundrett, he trusted that it would meet the general feeling of the house to bring him up to-morrow, in order that he might be examined, and then discharged, as his present confinement was very injurious to him in his professional avocations. The petition was then read. It stated, that the petitioner was sensible that he had justly incurred the displeasure of that house. He declared that, in refusing to answer questions put to him by the house, his motive was not from any disrespect of the house, or disregard for its authority, but that he had acted merely from a general sense of his professional fidelity. He also declared that he was by no means instrumental in delaying the writ, as he delivered it to the person who employed him, within a very few hours after he had himself received it. He was himself entirely unacquainted with any of the candidates for the borough of Poole. He no longer persevered in refusing to disclose the persons who employed him, and was ready and willing to answer whatever questions the house should think proper to put to him, and hoped the house would permit him to be examined at their bar.&#x2014; The petition was ordered to lie on the table. Mr. Barham then moved that the petitioner should be brought up to-morrow to be examined.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>conceived that it would be contrary to the established rules of the house, that a business, which was fixed for
<col>846</col>
Thursday, should be taken up sooner than the day appointed. He did not recollect a single instance of such a thing having been done.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>conceived that the house could not, in this instance, depart from its accustomed rules, but he had no objection to Mr. Brundrett's being called up to-morrow, for the purpose of being discharged. He thought that Mr. Brundrett had by his petition, and declaring himself ready to answer, set himself right with the house, and he did not think that it could be their wish to keep him longer in confinement. If, then, the hon. gent. would alter his motion, and move for his being called up, not to be examined, but to be discharged, the personal inconvenience would be removed from the individual, and the rules of the house would be preserved.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>thought this would remove the objection. He might be discharged to-morrow, and an order might be then made that he should attend for the purpose of being examined on Thursday, that the house should go into the business.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Jeffery</member> <membercontribution>said, that he should be perfectly satisfied under those circumstances, that Mr. Brundrett should be called up tomorrow, for the purpose of being discharged. It was then ordered, that Mr. Brundrett should be called up to-morrow, for the purpose of being discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[POOR RELIEF BILL.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day, for the second reading of the Poor Relief Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Morris rose</member>, <membercontribution>and said, that although there were some parts of the bill to which he objected, yet there were some provisions of it so important, and so conducive, as he conceived, to the interest and comfort of the labouring poor, that he trusted the house would feel disposed to adopt them. The first feature of the bill, which he decidedly approved of, was the empowering magistrates to grant warrants of relief for those whom they knew to be proper objects. He also highly approved of the relief being given to the poor occupier of a cottage, simply furnished. As the law now stood, a person must sell his house, his furniture, his bed, and even the tools of his trade, before he was recognized as an object of relief. Those things, however, were as necessary as food itself; and it was only increasing the burthen on the parish to reduce the pauper to such an extremity of distress, that he should not
<image src="S1V0009P0I0446"/>
<col>847</col>
be able to do any thing for himself. He was sure that this part of the bill would meet the general feeling of the house. He considered that it would increase considerably the estimation of the magistrates, if they were not merely held up to the poor in the way of terror, as the enforcers of the penal code, but if they should be also held out as the dispensers of the national bounty and charity. He approved of the extension of the facilities to obtaining settlements, but disapproved of some of the clauses of the bill. He objected to creating a vestry jurisdiction, and would much rather those matters were trusted, as at present, to an overseer of the poor, whose decisions were still subject to appeal from every petitioner. Neither did he approve of the rewards that were held out at a distant period for the encouragement of industry: he thought those rewards were very well from private agricultural societies, but that national rewards should only be given for splendid services to the state, done at the hazard of life; or else for valuable discoveries. He thought the common duties of society brought with them their own reward. Upon the whole, there were so many points in the bill of which he much approved, that he hoped the bill would go into a committee, where it might undergo any alterations that were thought proper.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Davies Giddy</member> <membercontribution>would also vote for the second reading, but had strong doubts as to the propriety of the proposed relaxation of the laws of settlement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>rose shortly to reply. He was extremely sorry his hon. and learned friend behind him (Mr. Morris) disapproved of many points in the bill, which he himself conceived highly essential to a satisfactory amelioration of the poor-laws. There were, however, several of the clauses, which his hon. friend did approve; and if he could not obtain all the clauses embraced by the bill, he was desirous at least for the enactment of those, against which no material objection had been expressed. With respect to that clause in the bill which tended to facilitate the obtainment of settlements to poor persons long resident in a parish, he was extremely sorry to find a right hon. gent. (Mr. Rose), who was the first to introduce a relaxation into the laws upon that head, opposed to the present clause. In his own conception, nothing could be more inconsistent with reason, justice, and humanity, than the law as it now stood, which refused settlement to a
<col>848</col>
poor man, who had spent the vigour of his youth, and the industry of his whole life in a parish, maintaining an honest character and an orderly and exemplary conduct, in the support of himself and his little family, for 20, 30, or even 40 years, without ever calling on the overseers for parochial relief: it was cruel that such a man should be driven at the latter end of his life, borne down by age and infirmities, from the parish which had so long benefited by his honest labour, to a parish perhaps two or three hundred miles distant, where he happened to be born, but where he had never been since a boy, to seek a settlement and maintenance amongst persons to whom he was utterly unknown, and who would, of course, feel but a cold disposition to maintain an object, of whose character and merits through life, they knew nothing. A case of this sort had occurred in his own parish, since the dissolution of the late parliament, where a poor man of four-score, resident fifty years in that parish, applied for relief, and the overseers insisted on sending him to the parish where he was born, at a distance of 300 miles! It was enough to break the heart of any magistrate of humane feelings, to be obliged to give effect to the law in a case of so much cruelty; and therefore feeling himself unable to comply with that severity, he had contrived by an application to the overseers of the poor man's native parish and those in his own, to prevent the poor man from being removed. This wretched old man never had applied before for parish relief, and even locked himself up with his aged wife, in their miserable cottage, determined to starve to death rather than be sent to a workhouse. It was therefore desirable to do away this cruel distinction, and to enable the magistrates to do by law, what humanity forced them now to do against law. Another clause was that which enabled the parish overseers to refuse aid to the pauper until he should have parted with the last article of his miserable furniture, even to his bed, and expended the last shilling in his maintenance, instead of letting him keep his little furniture, and affording him some temporary relief at his own house during a time of sickness or transient distress, rather than forcing him naked to a workhouse, obliging him to become a permanent burthen on his parish. Upon the whole, he wished the bill to be allowed to go to a committee, to receive such amendments either by the expunction or the improve
<image src="S1V0009P0I0447"/>
<col>849</col>
ment of such clauses as now seemed exceptionable, and thus to enact such clauses as would be made unexceptionable, and which could derive no improvement from delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>took shame to himself, that he was not aware the bill was to have been this day read a second time. There were many clauses of the bill which he approved of, and thought they might be productive of much good; but there were others which he thought liable to strong exceptions, as tending very much to unsettle a system which, however desirous he might be to improve it, ought not to be materially changed without the utmost deliberation. He acknowledged he had originated the clause in 1793, which facilitated the acquisition of settlements to the members of friendly societies. He wished the principle could have been extended generally, but there were a great variety of instances, in which it would operate oppressively upon numberless parishes. Upon the whole, he wished the bill or the present to be improved as far as possible in the committee, that it might be printed, and sent forth for public consideration, and again taken up in the next session with further opportunities for deliberation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>lamented, that the right hon. gent. whose habits of industry had inclined him to pay more attention to this subject than any other member of that house, should now say he was unprepared. After the bill had been introduced in the last session, divided into four, discussed in a committee, printed, distributed through the country for the consideration of the magistrates; and, after the notice of a week that the bill was to be read a second time this day, that the right hon. gent. should say he had not considered it, was extraordinary; and if such a plea came from him, what could he expect from other members less in the habit of attending to such subjects? He had been charged with pertinacity in continuing to urge forward this system; but he disclaimed all pertinacity. He hoped, however, there was nothing reprehensible in a member of that house persevering in measures which to him appeared right and salutary for the public good; and if the right hon. gent. did not approve the whole bill, there were some clauses at least, which he allowed were admissible, and to the enactment of those he could surely have no objection </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lushington</member> <membercontribution>spoke generally in favour of the bill, though there were a few points
<col>850</col>
to which he had objections. He particularly approved of that part which enabled the magistrates to award relief in those cases where the overseers refused it, and that part which proposed rewards for long and exemplary conduct in poor persons, who in their own sphere acted as meritoriously as the soldier, who, in another line of life, became entitled by his exploits to the bounty of his country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>denied there was any such law in existence, as that which he was surprized to find taken for granted in the course of this debate, namely, a law empowering the overseers of the poor, to refuse relief to a pauper, until he should have sold all his little furniture for his maintenance. He had heard, indeed, that overseers in many parishes, where there was no resident justice of the peace, assumed to make such a law, or to act as if it were in existence; but he hoped it would not go forth to the country, that any such law existed in the British statute books. Such a principle was directly contradictory to the statute of the 9th of Geo. I. which gave the magistrate an appellant jurisdiction on the overseer's refusal, and empowered him to award relief upon affidavit, shewing just ground.&#x2014;After a few words in explanation, the bill was read a second time and ordered to be committed.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion that the bill for extending the Royalty of Glasgow be now read a third time, Mr. Maxwell moved as an amendment, that the said bill be read this day three months, which after a conversation, in which Mr. Boswell, Mr, Laing, and Mr. Creevey supported the amendment, and the lord advocate and solicitor general of Scotland the bill, was negatived on a division of 41 to 21. The bill was then read a third time and passed.&#x2014; Mr. Mellish presented petitions from the parishes of St. Mary, Islington, and St. Clements Danes, against the Parochial Poor Relief bill.&#x2014;The Speaker acquainted the house that lieut. col. Alexander Park not having entered the required recognizances within the time limited by act or parliament, the petition complaining of an undue return for the shire of Kinross fell to the ground, and the order for hearing the same was discharged. The time for entering into recognizances on the petition complaining of the undue return of sir James Craig tor the town of

<col>851</col>
Carrickfergus was enlarged to this day se'nnight.&#x2014;Mr. Jones gave notice, that it was his intention in the early part of the ensuing session, to move for leave to bring in a bill to compel parochial officers to give in on oath certain rate-books previous to elections.&#x2014;Mr. Brundrett, who had refused to answer the interrogatories of the house, on the subject of the detention of the Poole writ, and who had been committed to Newgate for that refusal, being in attendance pursuant to order for the purpose of being discharged, was brought to the bar, where he received the following reprimand from the Speaker: "Jonathan Brundrett; an unwarrantable delay appearing to have taken place in the execution of the last writ of election for the town and county of the town of Poole, and it appearing also that the writ was delivered from the great seal into your hands, you were interrogated at the bar of this house touching your conduct in that transaction, and you then thought fit to refuse making answer to the questions upon which you were examined. For that contumacy you were committed a prisoner to his majesty's gaol of Newgate, in order that you might feel, and others might know, that this house will not suffer any man, with impunity, to violate its privileges, or set its authority at defiance. But now that your imprisonment has brought you to a confession of your error, and a proper sense of obedience; this house accepts your submission, and consents to your discharge; and you are discharged accordingly." On the motion of the chancellor of the exchequer, what the Speaker had said in reprimanding Jonathan Brundrett, was ordered to be entered on the journals. Mr. Brundrett was ordered to attend on Thursday next, at the resumption of the enquiry respecting the detention of the Poole writ; and Mr. Wm. Spurrier was ordered to attend at the same time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[PAPERS RELATING TO THE POLYGARS.] Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>rose, pursuant to notice, to move for certain papers tending to throw light upon the conduct of the Indian government towards the Polygars. His object was to vindicate the character of the country, by the investigation of the parts of the Indian system, which called most loudly for enquiry, and as far as that should be found possible, affording redress where in jury had been done. He wished also to impress the necessity of correcting the whole system on which the government of India had been for some time conducted. The
<col>852</col>
transaction to which these papers referred, was but one of many which had left a very dangerous rankling in the minds of the natives. The systematic interference of the Indian government at home and abroad, with the prejudices and habits of the natives, had excited great dispositions in their minds to hostility towards the British interest. He adverted particularly to the late lamentable transaction at Vellore, which had originated from an interference of this kind. The whole system called loudly for enquiry and reformation, which he was anxious by every effort of his to expedite and carry into effect. With this view he gave notice, that unless the noble lord opposite (Folkestone) should be prepared to bring forward the Carnatic question in a fortnight after the commencement of the next session of parliament, he would himself call the attention of the house to that subject. He should now only move for copies of the instructions given by the Bengal government to major Bannerman in 1799, for the regulation of his conduct towards the Polygars, and also several other papers connected with the same subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the production of the papers, but entered his protest against any inference of criminality in any one in the measure of disarming the Polygars, which had been rendered indispensably necessary by the disorders these Polygars were eternally committing. He should himself move for further papers, with a view to place the whole subject in a fair light.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Addington</member> <membercontribution>entered his protest against the prevailing practice of moving for papers with a view to crimination, without any ground whatsoever to induce a presumption that there had been criminality.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>said, he should be ready, early in the next session, to proceed to the discussion and decision of the Oude question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grant</member> <membercontribution>rose to state, that nothing could be more erroneous than to suppose that the late unfortunate affair at Vellore arose from a system, or a design to interfere, in any manner, with any of the habits of the natives. There was no such design at home or abroad; and though such an idea had for some time been prevalent here, he could assure the house, from a particular perusal of the papers relating to the transaction, that there was no ground whatever for the opinion. The principal motive of the authors of that lamentable
<image src="S1V0009P0I0449"/>
<col>853</col>
transaction, seemed to be a wish to restore the sons of Tippoo Sultaun to the throne of their father.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Keene</member> <membercontribution>entered into an historical detail of the proceedings with respect to the Polygars, which he defended.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wallace</member> <membercontribution>vindicated not only the court of directors, but the government of Madras, from the charge of interfering with the habits and prejudices of the natives of India.&#x2014;After a few observations from sir A. Wellesley, the papers were ordered; and also several other papers moved for by Mr. Dundas.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion of Mr. Whitbread, the house went into a committee on the Parochial Schools bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member> <membercontribution>said, that understanding from the hon. gent. that that was the stage for proposing any clauses that might be deemed necessary, he rose for the purpose of submitting a clause to the committee. His great objection to the bill in its present form was the mode of carrying into effect the relief proposed, namely, by compulsion. He disapproved entirely of compulsion; in its present form, the bill was not to be fitted to the parish, but the parish to the bill, and this he thought would be in general impracticable: besides, if compulsory, it might considerably check the spontaneous charity of many individuals: another objection was, that it was teaching the persons relieved that they might claim as a right that relief which they ought to be taught to look upon as a favour. He was not at all anxious that any of these bills should pass into a law this session. The public were anxious to give their opinion upon them, and, as far as he could learn, that opinion was against them, for certainly he had heard of many petitions against the bill, and not one in favour of it. The clause he had to propose was, that it be lawful for the Churchwardens, parish officers, &amp;c. to hold vestries in their respective parishes, for the purpose of taking into consideration the best means of establishing a school or schools, under the direction of fit persons, to be by them appointed for the better education and instruction of the poor of the said parish. Something to this effect, he thought, would be better than any compulsory method; for certainly the inhabitants of each parish were better judges of the claims of their own poor, and their own means to judge of and provide for these claims, than
<col>854</col>
gentlemen in that house could possibly be.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>said, he was not at all sure that the house could pass this measure in the form of a law this session, but it might perhaps be expedient at least to make it take the shape and form of a law, as they were all agreed as to the necessity of instructing the poor. It was giving power to the churchwardens to do, under the sanction of parliament, what they already were in the habit of doing; and as he approved so much of the principle of the bill, he should support it in its present state.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hawkins Browne</member> <membercontribution>thought it was certainly the duty of parliament to provide regulations to instruct the poor; but to get them to receive it, was a very different thing. In many parishes, the office of school-master would become a perfect sinecure. It would be extremely difficult to find any number of parishes to which the same law would properly apply. Some contained 10,000 inhabitants, while others contained only 30. Some were flourishing in their manufactures and trade, and others decaying. Some were supported by agriculture alone. Some had no endowments, while others had charitable institutions and free-schools. While he disapproved of the measure, he at the same time gave the hon. gent. who had brought it forward, great credit for his patriotism and zeal for the public good, but he really thought parliament had not come to a sufficient investigation of the subject, to enable them to come to a law, even although this had been an earlier period of the session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>was glad to perceive that his own opinion, as to the desirableness of not passing the bill during the present session, seemed to accord with the general disposition of the house. It was certainly more important that this subject should be decided upon, than that it should be decided upon soon. It was highly to be wished, that there should not be any appearance of forcing this plan upon the people, and he regretted to find upon conversing with many magistrates, and other country gentlemen, that they were not so well disposed towards it as he was himself. At the same time, he could not approve of the amendment proposed by the hon. gent., because, if the voluntary measure which he recommended, should be unsuccessful, it would be very difficult afterwards to carry the compulsory one into execution. The necessity of instruction among the lower classes in the south
<image src="S1V0009P0I0450"/>
<col>855</col>
and west of England, and in Ireland, was strikingly obvious; in the latter particularly, he was convinced that on the instructing and enlightening of the people depended the very safety of the empire itself. Still, although general instruction might be very practicable, he was not quite prepared to agree to the sending out a parliamentary edict for that purpose. He thought that sufficient pains had not been taken to avail ourselves of the voluntary institutions for the education of the poor, and was of opinion, that it would be a great improvement to the measure, were it only to operate where those institutions were deficient. Having instanced several cases in which the detail of the bill might be improved, he recommended that the bill should be made as good as possible, and be then sent to the country for the general sentiment. Parliament ought not to be hasty in this business: they ought to recollect that they were legislating for posterity on a subject in which their happiness was more concerned than in any other; for he was convinced that in a thousand attempts to do good, there was not one the result of which could be ascertained with so much satisfaction as the diffusion of useful knowledge.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>expressed himself happy to find, from the conclusion of the hon. gent.'s speech, that he continued to be an advocate for the diffusion of knowledge: such an opinion was to be expected from a man of his character and conduct, and one who had paid such unremitting attention to similar subjects. He owned, however, that he was somewhat surprised at the inclination for delay which that hon. gent. had manifested. Had he not proofs in other parts of the world of the benefits which resulted from the diffusion of the truths of the gospel? And how were those truths to be still further diffused in this country, but by putting into every one's hands the keys of knowledge? The hon. gent. had allowed that the instruction of the Irish was indispensable with the safety of the empire; was a moment then to be lost? He (Mr. Whitbread) was then what that hon. gent. had often been, in the hands of the gradual abolitionists of the bill. The postponement would be espoused by those who hoped, by putting off the bill to another session, to get rid of it altogether. The measure had been opposed without having been even read, for if it had been read, it could never have been asserted that it was compulsory. It did
<col>856</col>
not compel a single child to attend; it only gave power to the magistrates to erect schools and to appoint schoolmasters: the rest would necessarily follow. This misrepresentation proved to him, that if the bill were re-printed and sent into the country, it would be only to make waste paper. When parliament met again, gentlemen would declare that they had not had time to read it, and would press for further delay. He desired, therefore, to have a decision on it in the present session. With regard to the petitions on the table, they did not complain of the principle of the measure, but of the enactments, as tending to affect the petitioners; but the bill contained a clause, enabling the justices to suspend the execution of the bill, where unnecessary. This would obviate any inconvenience, unless, indeed, the magistrates were supposed to be corrupt. If corruption were thus to be imputed to all men, every attempt to benefit mankind must cease. We must do nothing but lie down and die. It had been said, that the bill would put an end to charitable contributions. Not so. If in a large parish 6,000 children were educated by charitable contributions, and 10,000 were not educated at all, his bill passing over the former would apply only to the latter, whose situation was rendered at present so much more distressing by the contrast. It had been also said, that by the bill, parishes would be compelled to raise a shilling rate. No such thing. The bill only gave a power of doing so when necessary, a necessity that would perhaps not exist once in a thousand parishes. The impossibility of carrying the measure into effect in a year, had been dwelt upon. Why was it impossible? In many parishes schools were already erected. In others, temporary buildings might be used until schools were erected. It would be easy to find schoolmasters, among whom there would doubtless be a competition for appointments. If the committee adopted the proposed amendment, he should despair of its ever being the serious intention of the house to carry the general measure into effect. The most weighty objections that had been made to the bill, related to the metropolis and its neighbourhood. It was certainly not probable that police magistrates would be so likely properly to execute the provisions of the bill, as magistrates in the country, who possessed local knowledge and local interests. If, on the report of the bill, the members for the city
<image src="S1V0009P0I0451"/>
<col>857</col>
of London, or for the county of Middlesex, should propose a clause to prevent this power from being lodged in the hands of the police magistrates, he should not object to it. He repeated his wish, that the bill might pass in the present session. The example of Scotland, and the north of England, evinced the benefits of that instruction in which he was most desirous that the rest of the empire should participate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, declared that on no subject had he formed a more deliberate, and at the same time a more decided opinion, than on the advantages which a country must derive from the instruction of its people. The difference of opinion entertained by the magistrates, and others with whom he had conversed, was not on the benefit of instruction, but on the mode of conveying it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>was decidedly in favour of a measure which the hon. gent. (Mr. Wilberforce) supposed to be most intimately connected with the interest of Ireland and the general welfare of the empire. He thought it, however, to be his duty to state what was the opinion of a man who was not only a friend to the regular establishments of these conntries, but also to its political interests, and who was universally acknowledged to be a friend to the human race, he meant Mr. Howard the philanthropist: that patriotic and moral man had travelled through Ireland, and he stated, that if ever we attempted to incorporate any particular principles of faith with our education of the people in Ireland, we should certainly fall short of our object. He therefore hoped, that as far as respected that country the system of education would be conducted on the most liberal and enlightened principles of toleration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>urged the postponement of this measure. There appeared a general disinclination to it throughout the country, and in proof of this, he read a letter from a gentleman, stating, that at a quarter sessions, where above 30 magistrates were assembled, this measure had met with general disapprobation. He trusted, however, that the hon. gent.'s well-meant endeavours would give the greater facility to some practicable mode being adopted. He hoped that a plan would be effected, which should admit of mixing habits of industry with education; for in many places there was a disinclination in the lower orders to
<col>858</col>
send their children to school merely for education. If the bill were now to be adopted, it would incur a great expense in the erection of schools, &amp;c. without producing much practical benefit. He approved of the amendment, as best calculated to reconcile the country to the measure; it would thus be rendered more palatable, and a better chance would be afforded for its ultimate success.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Simeon</member> <membercontribution>thought the question came to this, whether it were better to adopt a voluntary or a compulsory mode of education. He found a general objection against enforcing this measure by compulsion. Poor parents were not averse to have their children educated; but from the ages of 7 to 14, in country places, they could send their children into the fields, and gain something for the better support of their families; and if deprived of this advantage, they would come sooner upon the parishes for relief. He thought no one could object to the education of the poor, provided it was coupled with religious instruction. He objected also to this measure, on account of its expense.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lushington</member> <membercontribution>objected to the amendment, as tending to render the measure itself perfectly nugatory.<lb/>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer professed himself a warm friend to the moral and religious instruction of the poor; but he thought that, by adopting the amendment of his hon. friend, the house would part with the measure for the session in a state infinitely preferable to that in which it would otherwise be. He agreed with an hon. baronet, that it was not advisable to couple proselytism with education; but he hoped that no fear of being suspected of such an intention would ever induce the house to separate religion from education; for he was convinced, that by a religious education alone, the people could be made good subjects, and their happiness be established.&#x2014;After some further discussion, a division took place;

The compulsory clause was therefore lost.&#x2014; On the re-admission of strangers to the Gallery, we found,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Pole Carew</member> <membercontribution>speaking against the bill. He said, he could never admit the justice of laying such an impost as two millions a year, the amount of the charge according to his
<image src="S1V0009P0I0452"/>
<col>859</col>
own calculation, upon one class of the community, namely, the landed interest of the country, to educate another class. But whatever advantage, in the way of morality, might arise to the poor from learning to read, he could see neither utility nor morality in teaching them writing and arithmetic, and he begged that gentlemen would just turn to the preamble, and substitute the words "writing" and "arithmetic," in place of the Word "instruction," and see how the matter would then bear in their own minds, as to the feasibility of the position, "Whereas great advantages to the lower orders are likely to arise from teaching them writing and arithmetic."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>immediately rose. He said, the hon. gent. had attempted to cast a degree of ridicule upon the preamble and the intent of the bill, which, in his opinion, it did not deserve. The hon. gent. asked, would any man say, after considering the principle in the way he had put it, whether morals were likely to be improved by writing and arithmetic? He (Mr. W.) was the man that would now stand forward, and answer, that they would; and he was ready to vindicate his opinion, but should be glad to hear the hon. gent. defend his own. He would assert, without fear of contradiction from any rational man, that writing and arithmetic, so far as they tended to exercise and improve the human understanding, tended also to improve morality; and that every vestige of knowledge, in progression from the humblest to the highest and most refined, operated proportionably to the improvement of morality amongst mankind.&#x2014; After some farther discussion, the bill was gone through, reported forthwith, ordered to be printed as amended, and to be taken into further consideration on Monday next.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. Sumner</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition from John Alcock, esq., praying for an enlargement of the term for entering into recognizances on the petition complaining of an undue return for the borough of Lancaster, on the ground of the indisposition of one of the sureties. He then moved, that the time of entering into recognizances be enlarged to Monday next. Sir J. Newport and Mr. P. Moore opposed the motion, on the ground that the time had passed for presenting such petitions. Mr. Dent pledged himself in a few days to bring before the house a scene of iniquity on

this subject of a very extraordinary nature. After a few observations from the Speaker, the motion was negatived without a division.&#x2014;Mr. Dent gave notice, that he would to-morrow move for leave to bring in a bill to prevent the feelings of the house from being thus played with.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY] Lord Castlereagh</member>, <membercontribution>in pursuance of the notice which he had had the honour to give, rose to call the attention of the house to the military measures which his majesty's ministers had thought it their duty to propose; a subject at all times important, but perhaps never so important as at the present momentous crisis. It had been to him a subject of considerable uneasiness, that the production of these measures had been somewhat delayed by his own personal indisposition; but there ware other and more serious causes which had induced government not to be hasty in bringing them forward. His majesty's ministers could not but feel, on coming into office, that the event of the campaign on the continent which was then opening, whether favourable or disastrous, was likely to present to the observation of parliament, the truest motives for inciting then to exertion&#x2014;motives much more powerful than any which the statements of government could otherwise produce. He could also assure the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Windham), that his majesty's ministers were anxious that their return to office should not be marked with any undue impatience to subvert the plans of their predecessors. Among the eminent qualities of the right hon. gent. the solicitude to destroy established systems was one, which he owned he was least desirous to emulate. Impressed with these feelings, his majesty's ministers examined deliberately the military system already in existence. He was prepared to admit, that whatever objections he felt to that system, he also felt considerable difficulty in making a fundamental alteration in it. A comparatively inferior system laid claim to protection, from the circumstance of its being in existence; and therefore, in what he should offer to the house, the right hon. gent. would not find such a deliberate purpose of alteration as perhaps he expected, or as characterized his own arrival in that department, which he (lord C.) had now the honour to fill. Having thus stated the reasons why this subject had not been submitted at an earlier period to the consideration of parliament, he should now feel it
<image src="S1V0009P0I0453"/>
<col>861</col>
his duty to propose to them a measure of great energy, which would put the country to much inconvenience, which would subject it to severe sacrifices, but which was rendered indispensable by the circumstances of the times, and by the measures of the late administration. On this point, he felt relieved from the necessity of entering into a particular and detailed description of this necessity. The present situation of Europe was enough of itself to rouse the public attention. If the late administration allowed, when they were in office, that the military strength of the country was inadequate to its objects, how much more so must it now be, when it was hardly possible to turn our eyes to any quarter in which the interests of Great Britain were not at stake? If the sphere or action were great, when the right hon. gent. was in power, how much was it extended at the present moment? We had now to support new principles of policy, and to feed so much larger an army employed on foreign service. In the army at home also, we were called upon either to make a great effort to render the second battalions of our regiments efficient, or with a due regard to economy, to abandon them altogether. He was apprehensive, however, that should they be abandoned, the weakness which marked them, would characterize the first battalions, and that the first battalions would soon become as inefficient as it was so deeply to be lamented that the second battalions now were. It was impossible to look to the general aspect of Europe, and to the returns on the table, by which it appeared how large a portion of our force was employed abroad, and even on the most superficial view, entertain a doubt of the necessity of great exertions indeed, if we were desirous of preserving our security at home and of not abandoning our military greatness abroad. If the necessity were disputed, he was prepared, and staked his personal responsibility to prove (could he do so without divulging that which ought not to be divulged), by the most satisfactory am undoubted details, that no voluntary or other local force was adequate to the wants of the country, but that for every thing of that description, a regular and efficient force must be substituted. The question therefore, was not whether the volunteer system or the Training bill, could be improved, but what that system was which would carry our regular army and militia to the highest point, with the least incon-
<col>862</col>
venience to the existing establishments, and with the most moderate pressure on the country? If he had satisfied the house that some substantive increase of regular force was necessary for the preservation of our dearest interests, it would be a proposition not very difficult to establish, that we must not rely for that amount of force which the public exigency required on the system of ordinary recruiting which the right hon. gent. opposite had projected, or on any system of ordinary recruiting which human wisdom had devised. He would not now enter into a detailed examination of the right hon. gent.'s system: that would be a subject for future discussion; but he would generally state it as his own deliberate and decided conviction, that if any system of ordinary recruiting were freed as much as it were possible to free it from the effects of undue competition, and were in every respect as well administered as it was in human power to administer it, it might keep up an army once brought to its standard, but it could never be competent of keeping up an army, and of increasing it at the same time. Let the house look at the result of the right hon. gent.'s system for the last six months&#x2014;the most favourable period of its operation&#x2014;they would find that, deducting the boys raised by it, the actual produce of men obtained for the army, was not so great as by the former double operation of the ordinary recruiting, and the Additional Force act, much less was it calculated to give that increase to our military strength, which the foreign measures of his majesty's late ministers (and into the wisdom of those measures he would not now enter) had rendered necessary. If therefore, it was meant to have a bona fide addition to the amount of our public force, it was perfectly illusory to depend on the ordinary recruiting; in truth, therefore, the question came to this, what measures must be resorted to to raise the army to the standard to which circumstances imposed the necessity of its being raised? Certainly, by some sort of compulsion. No desirable species of compulsion had ever occurred to any administration unconnected with ballot; and here he could not avoid condemning the unnecessary pains which the right hon. gent. opposite had taken to decry the use of ballot. If it were allowed that compulsion must be resorted to, and that compulsion must be founded on ballot, our choice was narrowed to a very limited extent. In submitting to parliament what
<image src="S1V0009P0I0454"/>
<col>863</col>
had occurred to his majesty's ministers as most expedient on this subject, he hoped they would not expect any peculiar novelty. He acknowledged that he had not made any very great discovery: he had indeed avoided every thing that appeared mighty ingenious, because he knew very well, that on all subjects, and especially on military subjects, these ingenious and complicated theories, although they might look extremely well on paper, were found to be sadly deficient when attempted to be put into practice. He was persuaded, whatever his opinion of the military plan of the right hon. gent. was, that at all times, and in a state of war above all other times, it was infinitely better to adopt the military establishments of the country as they stood, and to fortify and support them, than to weaken and throw them down for the purpose of substituting some speculation, of which experience alone could prove the superiority. There seemed to be this simple alternative on which to decide. If we were to raise a great number of men by ballot, the country must be called upon either to submit to a ballot for men direct for the regular army, or to submit to a ballot for men for the militia, with the view of our drawing from the militia that aid which the incomplete regiments of the line required. He would state the grounds for the option made by his majesty's ministers, and shew why they thought it the less advisable measure to raise a number of men by ballot direct for the regular army. It was true that the act of 1804 (the Army of Reserve act), to which he might consider himself a party, was for the purpose of raising men by ballot direct for the army; and it was also true, that if ever a military measure was beneficial to the country, it was that act, from which, in a very short space of time, most important advantages had been derived. If, therefore, the country stood in the same situation, as that in which it stood in 1804, he should certainly have thought it the duty of his majesty's ministers to submit to parliament some proposition, analogous to the Army of Reserve act; but it was impossible not to feel that the circumstances of the country were essentially different now from what they were then, and that they were now precisely such as to afford strong reasons for a preference of the other mode of increasing our military strength. In the first place, from the magnitude of our force (however yet inade-
<col>864</col>
quate) we had more nearly approached to those bounds by which every country limited in population, must necessarily be prevented from furnishing more men for its military service, or at least from furnishing them without considerable difficulty. If, therefore, a mode offered itself of procuring men with more facility than in any other way, that mode ought to be adopted. There was another striking difference between the situation of the country when the Army of Reserve act was passed, and the situation of the country at present. Just before the former period, the regular militia had been balloted, and had been called into service; now, their period of service had expired, and would terminate with the termination of the war. Whatever supplies, therefore, might now be drawn from the militia for the regular army, would consist of men whose services would be otherwise approximating to a conclusion, while the new levies, to fill up the deficiency thus occasioned in the militia, would consist of men commencing a term of service of 5 years. Thus the country would obtain a military protection ready for a new war or any other emergency, and would enjoy a diminution of those burthens which must otherwise be incurred at the conclusion of peace, to replace that very great portion of the militia which must in that event be discharged. In proposing, therefore, to levy men by ballot for the militia, rather than to revive the provisions of the Army of Reserve act, no new or avoidable burthen would be imposed upon the country, but that burthen merely would be anticipated, to which, on the return of peace, the country must submit. That part of the measure of the right hon. gent. last year, which excluded from the army any regular battalions for limited service, was another strong cause for preferring the mode now proposed of augmenting our force. It was true, that this obstacle was not insurmountable, but it was the wish of his majesty's ministers to disturb as little as possible the existing military establishments of the country. The levy of men for the militia would be less prejudicial to the country, and to the regular recruiting for other reasons. There was a greater proneness in the peasantry to enter into the militia than into the regular army. Men for the militia would not only be more easily got, but they would be of a better description; and although he allowed that the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0455"/>
<col>865</col>
large ballot which would be required, would raise the bounty considerably, yet it would not be raised so much as if the same ballot were to take place direct for the regular army. The balloting for the militia had become congenial to the habits of the country. It was familiar with it. The people recognized it with tranquillity, and the magistrates executed it with ease. The Army of Reserve act, although a most estimable measure at the time of its adoption, yet being one of comparatively greater pressure, after it had been four months in operation, degenerated so much, that those by whom it had been proposed, thought it their duty to move for its suspension. He thought also the house would feel, that the fact of the penalties under the Army of Reserve act never having been enforced, was a most serious obstacle to any recurrence to that measure. Those who were in power had transferred the penalties to the Additional Force act and that alone; but when the right hon. gent. proposed to parliament to repeal those fines in defiance of every principle of public justice and legislative dignity, he (lord C.) had endeavoured to shew how pregnant with mischief that right hon. gent.'s proposition was; and that it was one which would render nugatory any measure similar to the Army of Reserve act. That the step then taken was unwise, now appeared pretty strongly; and were he to propose a renewal of the Army of Reserve act, he was satisfied that he should, in consequence, subject the country to all the vexation of a legislative measure, which must end in complete failure. The house would also feel as an inducement to prefer the mode which he had suggested, that looking at the present state of the country, if the gentlemen of the militia were disposed to lend themselves to such a laudable object, it was much more desirable that any temporary inefficiency should exist in the defensive rather than in the offensive part of our military force. In every point of view, therefore, it seemed preferable to raise men for the regular army from the militia, than to raise men for the regular army by a ballot. It was a mere anticipation of a burthen which must be imposed; it was a cheaper method; it was one by which better troops would be procured; and it would ultimately restore to the recruiting market that monopoly which he was as desirous as the right hon. gent. opposite, that it should possess.&#x2014;Having thus detailed the grounds on which the measure
<col>866</col>
now proposed had been adopted, it became necessary to state the extent of the levy. At the termination of five years service, all men balloted for the militia were entitled to their discharge. The official documents proved, that from December next to the succeeding May, between 5 and 6 thousand of the militia would be so entitled to their discharge, besides the waste produced by other circumstances. He was anxious when the subject of ballot was agitated, to submit to the house the expediency of providing not only a cover for this deficiency and this waste, but also such a number of supernumeraries (for whom the officers now in the militia would be sufficient), as would render any further ballot for two or three years wholly unnecessary; so that a security would be given to the line, that a continual ballot would not exist in competition with their ordinary recruiting. In looking to the number of men which it would be proper to raise for these purposes, two questions offered themselves for consideration. What number of men could the militia afford to spare? and what number of men did the army indispensably require to put it in a state of adequate efficiency; that was, to place every regiment, including the second battalions, on its proper footing? Having duly weighed these points, his majesty's ministers proposed that all those men now serving in the militia exceeding three-fifths of the militia establishment in Great Britain, and one half of the militia in Ireland, should be transferred to the line. By this arrangement, about 21,700 men would be gained from the militia of Great Britain, and about 7,000 from the militia of Ireland. It had been thought better to propose to take the excess above three-fifths of the British militia establishment, and the excess above one-half of the Irish militia establishment, rather than to take two-fifths of the British militia and half the Irish militia, because as several of the militia regiments were not completely filled up; the latter mode would weaken them too much. In one word, by the proposed plan, the British militia would remain at three-fifths, and the Irish militia at one-half of its present establishment. The men to be raised by ballot were, as he before stated, for three objects, to cover the waste in the militia, to supply the deficiencies occasioned by so great a transfer from the militia regiments to the regular army, and to provide a body of supernumeraries large enough to prevent the speedy
<image src="S1V0009P0I0456"/>
<col>867</col>
recurrence of the ballot. To effect these objects, it had been thought better to mention a proportion, rather than a defined number. As the law at present stood, his majesty was empowered to call on the counties to ballot far a supplementary militia, amounting, in Great Britain, to 24,000 men, viz. 20,000 in England, and 4,000 in Scotland. As the number of this supplementary militia was exactly half of the established militia, so it had been deemed advisable to propose that the counties should be called upon for a supplementary militia and a half, making 36,000 men for Great Britain, besides 8,000 for Ireland. Allowing for the necessary waste, this would add at least 38,000 men to the gross military force of the country, and 28,000 men to the regular army; leaving with the militia a large body of supernumeraries, sufficient for a long period to release the standing army from the embarrassments, which a ballot must occasion; and, when peace should arrive, instead of not having any militia at all, the country would possess a militia of 36,000 men, and would only have to raise the difference between that number and the full establishment, namely, a fourth, or 12,000 men.&#x2014;Having thus stated the extent to which in the present public exigency it had been thought wise to carry the increase of the regular army from the militia, he observed, that no pains had been spared by his majesty's government to digest a mode of transferring the men from the militia to the line, more free from objection than any that had hitherto been devised, more palatable to the officers of the militia, and less likely to hurt that just pride in their different regiments, which they so laudably entertained. On this part of the subject his majesty's government would be extremely happy to receive any suggestions from the officers of militia, with which they might think proper to favour them. It had occurred to his majesty's ministers, that there were two objections which were likely to press on the feelings of militia officers; the first was, the large amount of the force that would be extracted from the militia; the other, the danger which the militia regiments would for a while incur of a relaxation of discipline by the volunteering and recruiting for the line. With respect to the first objection, he trusted it would not be deemed a very serious one, when it was considered that, although a great diminution in the numbers of the militia must certainly take place for the increase of the regular army,
<col>868</col>
yet that a greater number would immediately be supplied from the counties. With respect to the second objection, it was proposed, in the first instance, and for a certain period, to submit the recruiting for the line from the militia solely to the direction of the militia officers. It was proposed, that for 30 days after the issuing of the warrants, no soldier or officer of the regular army should interpose, or have any intercourse with the militia. It was in the contemplation of his majesty, and of his royal highness the commander-in-chief, to give as usual, commissions in the line, in proportion to the number of men raised, and to commission the officers in the regiment to which the men might be invited to go, should the wished-for number not be produced within the 30 days: but it was also proposed to accept a smaller proportion of men, provided they were produced in 30 days, in preference to the allowing of volunteering in round numbers, if a third was thus produced instead of two-fifths. He would submit to the house but a few observations on the terms of enlistment, because they would with more propriety become the subject of a future discussion. He was certainly far from wishing to anticipate the decision of parliament, on a question of so interesting a nature, as whether or not the men should be allowed to enlist for life; though he confessed that he differed very widely from the right hon. gent. opposite in his opinions on that point; he was by no means disposed to advise that the regulations adopted last year by parliament should be rescinded, and things restored to their former state. Yet still he thought it would be wise to give to individuals the alternative whether they would enlist for life or not; but he admitted that the only fit opportunity for discussing this question would be on the introduction of the Mutiny bill, and that such discussion was irrelevant to a collateral measure like that before the house. He would observe, however, that the right hon. gent. himself had not thought that no case could occur in which a deviation from his regulations would be advisable. He had certainly held out an expectation to all those who had served 21 years in the army, that they would be immediately discharged; but prudence would not allow him to venture on this step, and in the face of his own principles he abstained from discharging these men, who were very numerous, and
<image src="S1V0009P0I0457"/>
<col>869</col>
who were still in the service. If, therefore, the right hon, gent. relaxed the regulations of parliament, to suit his own convenience, surely he (lord C.) might call upon parliament to relax them for the convenience of the public and for the advancement of the general interest. If he were so fortunate as to persuade the house to agree to his propositions for transferring a portion of the militia to the line, and for raising a great number of men by ballot for the militia, he was convinced he could shew them, that whatever might be the expediency of granting such an option to the peasantry enlisting for the line, it would unquestionably be adviseable to give to the militia enlisting in the line, the option of a limited or an unlimited term of service; of course with an increased bounty for the latter; that those who were not so sensible of the charms of a limited term of service as the right hon. gent. opposite, might be empowered to make their election accordingly. He did not mean to make this a part of the general measure, but would submit it in a separate clause. He must not omit to state what it was the intention of his majesty's ministers to propose with regard to that part of the military force of the country which was not regular nor militia, but which was ready to support and come in aid of both;&#x2014;and first, as to the right hon. gent.'s measure of last year, the Training bill. In duty to him and to the house, some explanation was necessary of what had been done by his majesty's ministers on this subject, since they came into office, and of what they meant to do. The fact was, that if they had been the original advisers of the measure, or had partaken of the right hon. gent.'s partiality for it, it would have been out of their power to carry it into effect; for so happily was it contrived, that the ballot could not go forward in many of the counties, and though in this double carrying bill, the militia ballots were suspended, it left the training lists completely in the back ground. Consistently with the sentiments which he had already stated, he declared that though not an original admirer of the right hon. gent.'s measure, yet, being in existence, he wished to draw even from that measure, as much military resource as possible. He would, therefore, not propose to parliament to abolish that part of it which related to classifications, ballots, &amp;c. for the due execution of which government had it in contemplation to suggest some provisions; but as
<col>870</col>
to the training part, he confessed that he had never been able to obtain information; and he called upon the right hon. gent., if he could, to afford it to him, how that could possibly take place under the superintendance of a constable alone, the only way presented by the bill. Indeed, the right hon. gent. had contrived to throw such a ridicule over this part of the subject, that it was vain to hope we could inspire a rustic feeling upon it, or convert the training so directed into a rustic amusement. He pledged himself, therefore, to propose that this part of the training bill should not be realized; but he repeated, that he would not abandon the bill altogether, or rather he would not abandon that part of it which was taken from the Defence bill, which was the only efficient part of the Training bill, and which the right hon. gent. had contrived very much to disfigure. A fundamental objection which he entertained to the Training bill, was, that the time of service was too short. It was impossible to train men, unless they were organized; and when so organized, he thought that they ought to be liable to a longer service. What with the registering, balloting, &amp;c. &amp;c. the year appointed by the Training bill would soon vanish, and the ballot would soon be to recommence. If the volunteers should find themselves unable to continue a sacrifice, which was unquestionably a severe one, which had reflected the highest honour on their character and conduct, but which, in many instances, would scarcely be expected to be permanent; in this case, in the Training bill, or rather in the Defence bill, might be discovered a basis on which the military establishments of the country might be founded. Instead of balloting the men to be trained for a year, he would propose that they should be balloted for two years at least; indeed, three years would not be too long a period. If parliament consented to this, they might gain two objects; in the first place, the discipline thus diffused would be greater, and would qualify the subjects of it for the regular army if wanted; in the second place, looking to that amount of force which parliament had declared it was necessary, should be six times larger than the militia, or, in other words, 200,000 men, the seeds of a permanent military force might be planted in it, which might grow up as the volunteers might decline. His notion was, having laid the foundation of this force, to enable his majesty to direct
<image src="S1V0009P0I0458"/>
<col>871</col>
that, where the volunteers were not in this proportion of six times the number of the militia, a local militia should be created, by ballot, out of the men disciplined by the Training bill, to be officered out of the regular militia. He meant to propose that this local militia in peace, should be disciplined the same number of days as the regular militia, but that they should never serve out of their counties, except in cases of rebellion or invasion. Thus would be produced a regular and organized force, out of that which, according to the measure of the right hon. gent., could create nothing but embarrassment. By this, the Training bill might be rendered useful, for he entered his solemn protest against throwing down any great public establishment, for the mere purposes of speculation. Here was the difference between the right hon. gent. and himself; when the right hon. gent. came into office, he most unwisely did every thing in his power to relax the volunteer system, for the purpose of introducing his Training bill. He (lord C.) on the contrary, was not desirous to subvert any thing done by that right hon. gent.; the fact was, indeed, that with his best endeavours he had done nothing. He (lord C.) had always advised that the character and spirit of the volunteer corps should be upheld until some other decisively superior establishment could be discovered as a substitute. His majesty's present government had re-established the system of inspection of the volunteers; without that system it was impossible that any principle of economy could be observed&#x2014;that any security could be enjoyed for the proper administration of the funds, appropriated to various parts of the volunteer service, or that the volunteer establishment could be kept in an organized state. It was in the contemplation of his majesty's ministers to encourage volunteer corps, not to substitute permanent service for their drill days, for that in most cases would be inconvenient, and in many impracticable, but to pass those drill days in exercises from home. It would then be seen which of those who entered into volunteer corps, did it for the sake of exemption, or for other motives. If parliament should think fit to adopt any subsequent measures on this subject, his majesty's ministers would not shrink from it. Let them, however, be deliberate in their undertaking, recollecting the old saying, "the more haste, the worse speed."

The noble lord here entered into a brief recapitulation of his arguments. He had been called upon to propose to parliament, in a time of exigency, a measure adequate to meet that exigency, and which therefore, whatever its nature might be, was open to strong and plausible objections, since it must be one of great burthens and imposing great sacrifices on a country which had already borne great burthens and made great sacrifices, not with patience only, but with pleasure. But he was convinced that the country would feel now, as it had always felt, that those who proposed these burthens were its best friends, because they were proposed for the security and welfare of the country. On subjects of this nature, considerable difficulty existed in giving a preference to one among various measure, all standing on the ground of solid argument and ingenious reasoning; but he could assure the house, that the proposition which he had the honour to submit to them was the result of the most anxious consideration from the earliest period after the acceptance of office by his majesty's ministers. They had made the best proposition they could&#x2014;had disturbed, as little as possible, the existing establishments, and had not allowed themselves to enter the field of military discovery. Unquestionably, the militia service would, for a time, be disturbed, but it would soon recover itself, and he was sure that when the officers of the militia considered that the men taken out of the militia for the advantage of the country, were only those men who must soon have been discharged by law, and that in lieu of them they would receive fresh and abundant materials for rendering the militia efficient both in peace and war, they would give their cordial support to the measure. It was a consolation to reflect, that the history of this country did not afford an instance in which, when the public mind was called upon to encounter difficulties, it was not the peculiar characteristic of Britain to rise superior to every obstacle, and never to be so strong or so distinguished, as after the pressure of distress. That individual, who, unfortunately for the world, had acquired such an ascendancy on the continent, was little aware, that by that very ascendency he was creating in this country a power to which the world might ultimately look for deliverance; and that out of the necessity which his inordinate ambition produced, the military character of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0459"/>
<col>873</col>
Great Britain would probably be raised to a greater height than any to which it had hitherto attained. The noble lord concluded by observing, that he should divide the measure into two bills, and that if the bills, for which he was about to move, should not be ready for delivery to members on that night, of which he was somewhat apprehensive, he should not press the second reading on Friday, but propose that it be postponed to Monday. He then moved for leave to bring in a bill, for allowing a certain proportion of the militia in Great Britain voluntarily to enter into his majesty's regular forces.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir George Warrender</member> <membercontribution>thought that the noble lord had not made out any case to shew, that any considerable addition was necessary to the disposeable force. It appeared to him extraordinary that with the views entertained by the hon. gentlemen opposite, and considering the charges made by them against their predecessors, for not having sent expeditions to the continent,they had not made this proposition to parliament upon their first coming into office. If the measure had been brought forward last session, and he had had the honour of a seat in that house, he might have supported it; but he could not give his consent to it on the present occasion, when the country had only to look for a defensive force. As to the transfer proposed from the militia to the regiments of the line, he felt considerable difficulties upon that subject, because the measures necessary to replace the men so transferred would interfere with the regular recruiting. The militia was certainly a favourite service, because it was limited both as to time and place, and was attended with a provision for the wives and families of the persons who engaged in it. There could be no doubt therefore that men would be more readily had for that service than for the line, a circumstance that would materially interfere with the ordinary recruiting. The system that had beer adopted last year, he contended, had proves eminently successful. The right hon. gent. who had brought forward that system, had uniformly stated that the benefits to be expected from it would be progressive, and the event justified his statement. The effect produced by it in the northern counties was very great, and by the papers upon the table, it appeared that by this system the number of men raised in the year 1807, was greater by 700, than the number raised in the corresponding period of last year under
<col>874</col>
the last system. If the remaining months of the year should be equally productive, of which he had no doubt, the whole number raised under the new system, in the year 1807, would be 22,000. The noble lord had said, that it was not his intention to alter any part of that system by his measure, but whilst the ballot would be going on, it would be almost impossible to obtain a man for the regular army. He was sure the house would be disposed to make every sacrifice that the occasion might require, but the country had a right to consider, whether it could look with confidence to the efficacy of the sacrifices it was called on to make, and to expect that its resources should be properly applied. And if they looked to the manner in which the present ministers came into office, the country would have no reason to be satisfied on this head. He felt that the measure proposed, would not add to the military force of the country, but transfer a portion of one branch of it to another; and, therefore, should not think that he was discharging his duty, if he did not oppose it in every stage. The noble lord had said, that the king had at present the power, without resorting to parliament, of calling out the supplemental militia to the number of 24,000. Of this he doubted, because there were some of the supplemental militia at present in the service; and if the power existed at all, he could not think it would extend to a greater number, than the difference between the number of those of the supplemental militia now serving, and the whole amount of that militia. There might be different opinions respecting the propriety of calling out the supplemental militia, but of this he was certain, that the measure of the noble lord would do away the benefit derived from the regular recruiting. The system now in force would in the present year produce 22,000 men, and would prove progressively more productive in every future year. The plan of the noble lord would impede its progress, and operate as a very unequal tax upon the public, for every gentleman must know, that not one of six of the balloted men served in person, so that, in procuring a substitute, the individual was subject to a most severe and unequal tax. Upon all these grounds he should feel it to be his duty to oppose the measure, unless it should undergo such modification in the committee as would remove his objections.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Yorke</member> <membercontribution>wished to take the earliest
<image src="S1V0009P0I0460"/>
<col>875</col>
opportunity of stating his objections to the measure proposed by his noble friend, because, however disagreeable it might be to him, it was the duty of every gentleman in that house, to state candidly his impressions upon a subject of such importance. He was undoubtedly aware, that what he was going to state, would not meet with general concurrence, but he was acting under a feeling of duty, and should declare his sentiments with candour. We had now come to a crisis when the situation of affairs would not admit of blunders, when an error might be fatal, and every member was therefore bound to make a free communication of what he felt upon the subject. He approved most cordially of that part of his noble friend's proposition, which provided for the transfer of so many men from the militia as could be induced to volunteer into the line. That part of it was most efficacious, and if the proposition were to stop there, it would produce great public benefit, because the men so added to the army would be applicable to the protection of Ireland, where the militia could not be expected as a body to serve. The men also, who should volunteer into the regular army, would very soon be fit for service in the regiments to which they might be transferred. As he understood his noble friend, his plan was to raise 38,000 men by ballot for the in order to replace those who should volunteer into the line, and to provide a certain number of supernumeraries, in order to supply the vacancies as they should occur by casualties, and the expiration of the men's service, so that it should not be necessary to resort again to the ballot for some time. To this part of his noble friend's plan he objected, because it did not appear to him to be efficacious. As to the application of the ballot, he had objections to that too, but not on the ground stated by the hon. member who had just sat down. It was his conviction that the ballot was necessary, and when that particular mode of raising a supply for the army had been the subject of much obloquy in that house, he had defended and supported it. He had on that occasion stated, what he was now ready to repeat, that no force adequate to the protection and defence of this empire could be obtained without some species of compulsion. No great army could be raised and kept up without having recourse to a compulsory levy. And it surprised him to hear gentlemen who applied their minds to such subjects, and supported
<col>876</col>
the reputation of statesmen, assert, that, when an army of three or four hundred thousand men was to be raised, such a force could be supplied by voluntary service. He agreed with his noble friend, that this was not the time for discussing the merits of the measure, and he equally approved of his intention not to disturb the system of the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Windham) this session. It had always been his wish to allow any measures that might be adopted by parliament a fair trial, and it was on that principle he acted, when he had proposed to give the late Defence act an opportunity of fair trial. With respect to the plan of the right hon. gent. opposite, however, he was bound to state that it did not appear to him efficacious, and might be dangerous. That plan, he admitted, might be adequate to keep up the numbers of the army, if once the army was raised to the establishment voted by parliament, and he had said the same of the measure of the right hon. gent. now no more (Mr. Pitt). But though he admitted this, the measure would not answer his purpose. The system, he allowed, had produced something more than the ordinary recruiting, and the Parish bill. But the noble lord had stated, that the deficiency of the army, from the establishment voted by parliament, amounted to between 52 and 30 thousand; the casualties amounted to 13,000; so that the number to be raised within 12 months, in order to answer the purpose he had in view, would be 38,000. He had also another objection to the present system, arising out of the alteration of the terms of service. The system might for that reason produce more men, but fewer soldiers. British soldiers should be military men, <i>sui generis</i>. They were often engaged against twice their number of enemies, and under disadvantages of situation and circumstances, of debarkation and embarkation; they must therefore be real soldiers, and British troops had always proved themselves to be of that description. If our brave but unfortunate countrymen in Egypt, where the efforts of every individual was necessary to repel the superiority of numbers that assailed them, had not been troops of that character, it would have been impossible to save the remains of that army. He did not concur in the objection to the ballot, because it would interfere with the system of the right hon. gent. This measure was to furnish 38,000 men to the army, and he could not see any reasonable objection to it on the ground of its
<image src="S1V0009P0I0461"/>
<col>877</col>
interfering with a part of the supply under the present system. They could not apply the conscription which had enabled France to overrun the continent to this country. But the ballot was applicable, both because it was necessary, and conformable to the practice of the constitution; but he could not assent to its application as proposed by his noble friend. By the papers upon the table, it appeared that the regular force at present in Great Britain and Ireland, was 25,000 less than when he went out of office, a period when so much was said about the necessity of augmenting that description of the national force. Upon this subject the house, he thought, ought to have some explanation. Though no person ought lightly to make a charge upon ministers for their distribution of the public force, yet when he considered how that force had been last year distributed, or rather scattered, he could not avoid saying, that the matter ought to be explained. A considerable force had been sent to South America, and though he should not say any thing of the merits of the first expedition to that country, because an hon. officer, a friend of his, had been tried for having undertaken it, he was ready to admit, that it was advisable to support the force that achieved the original conquest. But he wished to know from the right hon. gent. opposite, (Mr. Windham,) why, after the battle of Jena, so large a force as 5,000 men had been sent out under general Craufurd to America. These troops, from the manner in which the expedition had been conducted, had been nine mouths at sea. The troops which had been employed in foreign service, were the best of the British army. There was an army likewise in the Mediterranean, from which the expedition to Egypt had been detached. That expedition he felt it difficult to appreciate, nor should it have his approbation, unless it could be proved to him, that under all the circumstances of the case the project was well concerted and the force dispatched fully adequate to its object. From the circumstances he had stated, it appeared that a recruit for the army was necessary. The regular force in Great Britain and Ireland at present, was 15,000 less than even last year. It would be obvious how necessary it was in the present situation of the world, to concentrate the British army in these Islands with all possible expedition. As that was impracticable with respect to the distant troops, he agreed to the use of the ballot
<col>878</col>
to raise a considerable force; but he thought the ballot should be employed to raise an army of reserve, which would be disposable for the protection of Ireland, rather than to recruit the militia. The Army of Reserve act, and the other defensive measures which he had formerly brought forward, were only so many great steps towards making the country a military nation. He had long been a militia officer, but should not suffer his natural partiality for one branch of the military establishment, to prevent him from stating his opinion on it freely as a part of the whole. The militia had done much service, but was not now adequate to the object of its establishment, for it was not numerous enough. The number of the militia had been calculated upon the exigency of the wars in which this country had been heretofore engaged, and was consequently inadequate to the present crisis. A much smaller establishment was sufficient, when the most formidable expedition that could be equipped against any country, in 1744, which was composed of 30,000 troops, under Marshal Saxe, assembled at Boulogne, than under all the circumstances of the present war. Besides, the war had continued now 14 years with little intermission, and the officers of the militia, who had submitted to considerable privations and inconvenience, in order to make themselves soldiers, would not be disposed to continue during a war, of which they saw no end. He did not think it therefore possible that proper officers could be obtained for the militia during such a length of time. There were at present 56 second battalions in the country, which generally did not consist of more than 250 men each. It would, of course, be necessary to send 750 men to each to complete them, and all the men which were proposed to be got from the militia would not be sufficient to complete 36 of them. He should, therefore, propose that the remaining twenty should be added to the nine garrison battalions that were nearly complete, and that then the ballot should operate to fill those 29 garrison battalions. The advantage that he would propose from this would be, that instead of 25,000 men gained for the regular army for the defence of the country, there would be 46,000. As to the objection of his noble friend, that the ballot for the reserve would be productive of expence, by raising the price of substitutes, he was sure his noble friend must have been misinformed
<image src="S1V0009P0I0462"/>
<col>879</col>
upon that head, because undoubtedly the ballot for the reserve in the former instance, had not the effect of raising the bounties for substitutes for the militia. As to the remission of the penalties he had disapproved of that measure, but he could not agree with his noble friend, that it would be an objection to the effect of a bill for raising a similar one now, because it would equally apply to the militia acts, which had not been impeded by it. He had never thought the Defence act which he had brought forward perfect, but he had always considered it as a step taken upon the country towards its military organization. When he brought it forward, he had looked to it more as a stimulus to the volunteer force to keep it up to that amount, which would be adequate to the necessity of the times, than for any immediate effect from its own operation. He did not think that the militia should be reduced below 30,000, and therefore he wished that after it should be reduced to that number, the militia should be left in that state, and another force arising out of the general training act should be engrafted upon it. As to the observations of his noble friend with respect to the employment of the constable under the training act, he should only say, that as all these measures were new, it had not been thought advisable to subject the persons to be trained to the mutiny act, but rather to try how much the country would bear, and to leave the discipline to be maintained by the constable, who, in former times, was a person of even considerable military command. But he saw no reason why the persons, who should be called out as he proposed, should be subject to the new mutiny act in the same manner as the militia in time of peace. They might be taken out for a fortnight in spring, and a fortnight in autumn each year, and disciplined by the militia regiments,which should be marched into their counties for that purpose. A levy of 200,000 or even 100,000 armed and clothed, and thus engrafted upon the militia, though not to be regularly embodied till the occasion should arrive that called for their service, would compose a most formidable defensive force. This idea was not new, for a similar course had been adopted in 1796, with respect to the supplemental militia.&#x2014;He had thought it right to state thus freely his sentiments upon this question, and was confident the country was ripe for such a measure as that he had proposed, if the parliament should set the ex-
<col>880</col>
ample, and that in consequence, by Christmas next, the country would be in a situation to defy all danger. In stating his sentiments on the subject, he had discharged his duty. He saw that the military system of the country was far from perfect; he was afraid they talked too much on these subjects, whilst so little had been done. He had hoped that they had done with discussions of this description; but as the subject had been again broached, he trusted the house would take effectual measures for procuring a great army, which, added to our naval pre-eminence, would enable us to bid defiance to the tyrant, who had trampled upon the independence of so many of the continental states.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>coincided in most of the sentiments expressed by his right hon. friend, though he could not help being surprised at his having introduced into his discussion topics that had no immediate connexion with the question then under consideration. He contended that the measure of his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) was adequate to the purposes for which it had been intended, though it might not be sufficient to afford an immediate supply,such as the crisis demanded. His noble friend needed not to apologize for having made his proposition to parliament; the apology should, according to his impression, be for not having made it before. If the country was to be saved, it was by becoming an armed nation that its salvation was to be effected. He agreed with his right hon. friend, that the question now was, whether the ballot was to be employed for recruiting the militia, or raising an army of reserve; but he had some doubts of the propriety of allowing the militia to volunteer into the line, especially as the principal object of the measure was the internal defence. He was afraid, however, that his noble friend had his attention too much bent upon foreign and continental expeditions. The house should keep in view that it was desirable to have a force disposeable for Great Britain and Ireland. His right hon. friend had stated that the militia was in a declining state, but he had omitted to state that this measure would destroy the spirit of those who commanded and kept up that force. His noble friend had said, that it was not his intention to interfere with the existing establishments, but by this arrangement he would most materially injure a more important branch of the national force. Whenever the Militia had been before drafted into the line,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0463"/>
<col>881</col>
it was in the contemplation of foreign expeditions, but the present measure was brought forward with a view to home defence. After this measure should be carried into effect, no militia officer could look upon himself as belonging to a military establishment, if the house should sanction the impression, that it was unfit for the defence of the country. By adopting the proposition of his noble friend, they would run, the risk of breaking in upon a most important establishment. He could not agree in the recommendation of his right hon. friend, to have the militia regiments marched into their respective counties for the purpose of drilling the mass, because if marched from the military posts they occupied on the coasts, they would be rendered inefficient for immediate defence. The noble lord had stated as a ground of his measure, that about 6000 of the militia would be withdrawn from the service, in consequence of the expiration of their terms: but if these men were to withdraw from the militia, how could his noble friend expect to get them to enter for the general service? It was his opinion, that the militia ought rather to be increased than diminished. When the noble lord stated, that if the circumstances of the country were the same now, as when the Reserve Act had been brought forward, he should have preferred that measure, he could have wished that he had been more particular in pointing out what those circumstances were that influenced his mind. When the Reserve act had been resorted to, the object was to provide for the home and foreign service, but now the object was to provide for the home service only. Besides, an objection in the former case lay against the Reserve act, because the Militia, and Supplementary Militia had been raised by ballot immediately before. At present, the country had had the advantage of a long respite from the ballot, and the population of the nation had not for some time been called upon to make any very extraordinary efforts to assume a military character. The measure of the Army of Reserve was as perfect in its detail as the Militia acts, and had proved as efficacious in a short period as any measure that had ever been proposed. The suspension of the fines under the Reserve Act had been an act of justice. His noble friend had omitted to touch upon several other modes of recruiting, viz. such as give a single step of promotion for raising a certain number of men. The Training bill,
<col>882</col>
too, he thought ought to be put in force, in some shape or another; and he was sorry not to have heard his noble friend state in what manner he proposed to do that:&#x2014;as we approached the point of danger, the attention of all thinking men in the community was awakened to the means of repelling it. The right hon. gent. concluded by stating, that these extraordinary measures must of necessity interfere with the ordinary recruiting, but that in this country there should be as many channels as possible of procuring a supply for its military force.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham </member>, <membercontribution>though he admitted that that was not the proper time for discussing the measure proposed in detail, yet found it impossible to omit that occasion of contradicting and confuting, as he trusted, to the satisfaction of the house, some of the statements that had been made by the noble lord opposite. He felt it also necessary to trespass upon the indulgence of the house, in order to reduce the question to its real grounds. Since the noble lord had opened his plan, another, the competitor of that plan, had been recommended by the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Yorke), and his right hon. friend who had just sat down. If the ballot was again to be resorted to, he was inclined to think with those right hon. gentlemen; that it might be better used for raising an army of reserve, than in the way recommended by the noble lord. The plan of the noble lord was calculated to break down a most valuable branch of the military establishments of the country, and for the attainment of a force, which for a considerable time could not be superior to it. He had often been in the habit of contending in that house, that regiments of the line must be superior to militia regiments; and certainly he did not conceive that, in so doing, he was giving reasonable cause of offence to any description of persons whatever. It was not in the nature of things that troops, who could not by their constitution have any opportunity of real service, except in case of invasion, could acquire the same spirit and character, or attain to equal discipline, with troops accustomed to act together, and to witness the conduct of their officers in circumstances of real danger. The officers, too, of the militia, who entered that service young, and with a view to pass a few years agreeably, would not devote themselves to their profession in the same way as persons who
<image src="S1V0009P0I0464"/>
<col>883</col>
had nothing else to depend on for their subsistence, and for all their success and prospects in life. He had often contended that such a difference existed; and, until the more favourite charge respecting the Volunteers had been started, he bad been, for so doing, represented as the enemy of the militia. The gentlemen opposite had, on all such occasions, put themselves forward as the champions of the militia; but their present measure exemplified the truth of the Spanish proverb,&#x2014;Defend me against my friends, and I will defend myself against my enemies." He had often told the militia officers in that house, that it was not from him, but from those that professed to espouse their cause, that they had any thing to dread. The gentlemen opposite would not suffer any person to touch the militia but themselves. They had fatted them up for their own eating; they secured them as country gentlemen do the game in those places near their houses, which, by an odd <i>misnomer</i>, are sometimes called <i>the preserve</i>, where the game are, indeed, preserved, but only till some circumstance (the arrival perhaps of some favoured guest) shall furnish an occasion for falling upon them with redoubled fury. It was not to be expected that militia officers, who had made such sacrifices in the service, and bestowed such pains in disciplining their respective regiments, should not be disgusted at having their best disciplined men taken from them. It was still more provoking to hear, that this was done for the purpose of erecting a force for home defence. It was not, as had been well observed by his right hon. friend, for foreign expeditions that this measure was resorted to, but for home defence, for which the militia had been expressly formed. If the crisis called for such a measure, he was convinced the militia colonels, who had already made so many sacrifices in the service of their country, would be willing to submit to this also; but, then, they had a right to expect that the necessity of the sacrifice should be proved: as the country also had a claim to be satisfied, that it was necessary and proper for the purposes of immediate defence to begin by breaking up so large a portion of the existing force.&#x2014;This, however, was only the first effect of the noble lord's measure. The further and more lasting consequence was the destroying the ardour and confidence of the militia service for years to come. What could the men in the militia think of their offi-
<col>884</col>
cers, or what could the officers think of themselves, when they were told, that, if invasion was really to come, it was necessary to put the men under other leaders, and that those who had hitherto been at their head, who had been devoting their lives in preparation for a crisis such as was now arrived, were not the persons fit to conduct them into action, but must give way to others more proper for that office? If this was not an indignity, he was at a loss to know what was; or how it was possible to do more to put down, from this time forward, all zeal in the officers of militia to improve their regiments, and all belief on the part of the regiments that it was worth while to improve them, or that they could ever be brought to a state in which they should be able to face the enemy.&#x2014;But, to return to the immediate effects of the measure, and abandoning for the moment all consideration of its future consequences, how was it to tell for its professed purpose of immediate defence? For a certain time to come, the effect of this measure of strength could be no other than weakness. In whatever degree the hon. gentlemen might choose to describe the superiority of a regular regiment over a regiment of militia, they would hardly go the length of saying, that the worst of the first class was superior to the best of the other. They would not pretend to say, that there was not a period, and perhaps a pretty long one, during which the regular regiment, with its new recruits, would not remain inferior to, what the militia was before these recruits were taken from it; and during this period, whether of longer or shorter continuance, the country must be the weaker. Thus far, therefore, there could he no plea of necessity; for it never could be necessary for a country, with a view at least to any immediate pressure, to make itself weak. But a time will come, it seems, when the measure will make us strong. And with a view to this it is that we are to begin to calculate, comparing the degree of strength to be thus obtained, and the length of time during which it is to last, with the temporary weakness that will precede, and the increasing and endless weakness that will follow it. For it happens whimsically, that the measure now proposed as necessary for the salvation of the country, will be good for that purpose only on the supposition, that the attempt of the enemy shall be made within a certain prescribed period. Should it be a little too soon or a
<image src="S1V0009P0I0465"/>
<col>885</col>
little too late, should we be unable to bespeak the invasion, and to fix it exactly to our own time, all that we shall have been doing will have rendered our situation only so much the worse.&#x2014;The period of strength will, however, at last arrive, namely, when the men transferred shall have been so settled in their new regiments, as to give to the regular army more strength than the removal of the men shall have taken from the militia, and when our numbers shall, upon the whole, have been increased by the difference of those raised through the medium of ballot beyond what might have been raised in the same time by recruiting. We were to consider the price at which this increase of strength would be purchased, joined with the consideration of the time for which it was likely to last.&#x2014;He had already observed, that we were to pass to this period of strength through the medium of a period of weakness. He had observed, also, on the lasting evil that would be incurred in consequence of the effects produced on the militia service.&#x2014;The third head remaining to be considered, was the value of that system of military measures which was adopted last year, and to which we were now about to put an end. Upon the subject of these measures something of a preliminary question had arisen at the time, how far what was proposed was entitled to be called a plan. He for one had always rejected that title, disgusted, as he had been, by the applications which he had seen made of it: Yet he certainly did not mean thereby to admit, that in the best sense of the word, as implying the just distribution of a subject into its proper parts, and a systematic direction of those parts to the common purpose intended, the measures of last year were not as well entitled to that appellation, and indeed a good deal better than any measures that had preceded them; or, as far as at present appeared, than any that were likely to follow.&#x2014;The measures, however, of last year, had so far less of a plan, that their pretensions to merit, contrary to what might be the case now, was more in what they <i>un</i>-did, than in any wonder-working powers which they professed to have in themselves.&#x2014;The army had been, for years, supported by shifts and expedients. It was supplied by means which could not last, and which, while transitory themselves, were continually destroying the resources from which any supply could be expected in future. It had been kept alive by drams and cordials. Its con-
<col>886</col>
stitution, in fact, had been so broken by the experiments which had been tried upon it, and the discipline which it had undergone, it had been so bled and cupped, and blistered and purged, that, when the new Practitioners were called in last year, there remained no hope (conformably indeed to the opinion which they had often given) but by discarding medicine altogether, and trying what might be done by nature, when left to operate for herself. If the patient was to be saved, it must be by air and exercise, by diet and regimen, by good and wholesome food, given too in sufficient quantities. The best service to be rendered in the first instance, was, to tear the prescriptions, and throw all the physic bottles out of the window. This was the basis of the plan of the late ministers with respect to the army. They were led to this plan as well by consideration of the general nature of things, as by reflecting on what had been the history of the military establishments of the country for many years past. Within a period not exceeding the memory of many whom he was then addressing, a guinea to buy necessaries, and a crown to drink the king's health, was all that was given to a recruit upon his entering the army. A bounty properly so called, that is to say, a price to tempt a man to do what he was otherwise disinclined to, was unknown. The service was its own price. So late as at the beginning of the American war, examples were found of officers reprimanded by the war-office for having extended the bounty so far as to two or three guineas. Among the general causes operating to produce the change which afterwards took place (those great ones, namely, of the depreciation in the value of money, and the continuance of the pay at the same rate at which it stood in Charles the Second's time), a cause of a more limited, but of a more immediate effect, was the militia. This system, for reasons which he had often stated, and would not now repeat, did not, for several years after its establishment, produce any consequences affecting materially the recruiting of the army. But at last, as the militia assumed a more regular form, as the practice gradually prevailed of calling it out, and keeping it constantly embodied during every war, as its discipline improved, and the practice of substitution took place of that of serving in person, its effects upon the army began to be severely felt. The demand for substitutes on the part of men placed in circumstances the most disad-

<col>887</col>
vantageous for obtaining what they wanted upon reasonable terms, soon brought things to a state, in which service in the militia (a service for a few years, and within the kingdom), could be purchased only at a high premium, and in which men, therefore, could hardly be looked for in great numbers, who would be willing to forego this premium, and enter the army for nothing. The only expedient that occurred for remedying this evil, was to give a bounty for the army also; and thus to enable the army to hold up its head, and bid against the militia. But though this succeeded for a time, its very success was such as contained a principle destructive of its continuance, the effect of the competition being to raise the price upon both services, till at length a sort of limit was produced, not merely by the consideration of expence, but by the effect which the high bounties had in producing desertion. Nothing now was thought to be left, but to have recourse to compulsion, that is to say, ballot: but as ballot could not be applied directly to the army, the expedient devised was to augment the militia, in order that afterwards the men might be induced, by bounty, to extend their services, and become soldiers complete.&#x2014;Upon this view, a grand attempt was made, in the years ninety-six and ninety-seven, to raise the militia from thirty thousand to very near 100,000 men; and in the years 1799 and 1800 out of the force so raised, to transfer to the army a force of about 46,000. Neither attempt succeeded to the full extent. The projected 100,000, with all the endeavours used, could never be made to rise much higher than 70,000; and of the 46,000, the first portion, or 20,000, with whom the trial was made, were obtained in the year 1799, at the time of the Dutch expedition: but of the remaining 26,000, to whom permission was given to enlist in the year following, not more than 12,000 were obtained at the time, the rest were left to enlist at their leisure, and, if they should still decline, were to continue subject to be called upon for the militia. The militia laws had, in the mean time, fallen into great confusion, owing to these successive changes; and a right hon. gent. (Mr. Yorke) making part of the government the time, had, in consequence, in the year 1802, introduced an act, meant for the purpose of consolidating all the former acts, and settling the system upon a permanent footing, but still keeping in view the grand
<col>888</col>
object, the augmentation of the number, on account of the difficulty that was found of adding, by any other means, to the military force of the country. The establishment of the militia for this country was to be 40,000. But even here, unfortunately, the authors of the measure reckoned without their host. War came, and the price of a substitute rising in consequence above the amount of the penalty, the measure produced only money and not men. New expedients were then devised, to make the amount of the penalty keep pace with the bounty; and the whole scheme being, after all, insufficient for its purposes, new militias were created, new augmentations made to those already subsisting, and new measures brought forth on a similar principle, though of a different form. He had forgot, in the enumeration of the measures previous to this period, the famous Quota bill, by which mutiny was introduced into the navy, and the Provisional Cavalry bill, the most diverting certainly, if not the most efficacious of all the measures of the class in question, by which sums had been paid to the amount of 70 or 80 guineas to rescue old ladies from the terrors to which they were exposed of being turned into light-horsemen. Greater designs were now conceived, and greater powers brought into action. Besides the militia in Ireland, which was created or augmented about this time, a new militia, on somewhat more extended terms of service, was set on foot, under the name of the Army of Reserve. Many gentlemen had expressed their opinion, not without great show of reason, that if a measure of the sort at present proposed was to be adopted, it should be a repetition of the Army of Reserve. The great objection, of course, was the extreme hardship, which, besides that it was a strong objection in itself, had the effect also of rendering the measure, after a certain point, incapable of being executed. Such had been the case in the instance in which the measure had been already tried. After a certain time, a re-action had been produced which made it incapable of proceeding a step further. The measure was therefore abandoned, not from any caprice or jealousy in the government which succeeded, who, on the contrary, shewed a desire to continue it as far as they could; but because it was <i>functus officio</i>; it had done less indeed in some degree than it had hoped, but all that it could do. The Parish bill succeeded to it; and it was not
<image src="S1V0009P0I0467"/>
<col>889</col>
necessary to point out to the house what the failure of that bill had been. [A cry of no, no, from the treasury bench.] If this measure had not failed, it must be because some new definition had attached a different meaning to the word failure. He knew of no criterion of failure in any undertaking, but that of not doing what it had intended and engaged for. The Parish Bill had engaged to raise 40,000 men in about 15 months, that is, by the 1st of October 1805: in about twenty months, that is, by the 1st of March following, it had not raised 13,000; and during its whole continuance, it never produced to the amount of 16,000. This, according to common ideas, would be called failure. But had it succeeded ever so well, it never could ultimately have furnished to the regular army more than 9000 men a year. Nay, there was a degree of success which would have prevented even that, and have put an end to the measure altogether. If all who had been raised under the bill, had agreed to extend their services, and to enter the army, fulfilling thereby the very purpose which the measure had in view, the bill from that moment would have ceased to exist. It could not continue but by failing in part to execute what it intended. In that way it might, it was true, continue to operate, though its success was for its <i>maximum</i> limited in the way which he had stated, and had for its <i>minimum</i> no limit all, but might be reduced to the supply of the casualties on a portion of the Army of Reserve, however small. No further failure need indeed be looked for in the bill, than its being one which, from the burthens it imposed, the injustice which it committed, the serious oppressions and abuses to which it led by converting into an engine of recruiting all the parochial government and smaller police of the country, was rejected by the general voice, was thrust out of the statute book by the universal conviction of its unfitness to continue there The Parish bill therefore died a natural death, and was not put an end to prematurely by any desire on the part of the ministry of the time, to make way for a favourite measure of their own, It ended as all its predecessors had done, if not like some of them, by having absolutely run itself out, and having reached the point beyond which it could not stir a step, yet by shewing, that, after all that could be hoped for from it, the evils attending were such as to make its continu-
<col>890</col>
ance no longer tolerable. The proof is, that no one has ever thought of reviving it. If its merits were what the hon. gentlemen had so often contended, if it really was that system of recruiting which had accomplished the object so long sought for, and discovered a source of recruiting on which the army might safely rely, why, in God's name, did not the hon. gentlemen propose to the house to re-enact it? It was in vain for them to say, that the remission of the penalties under the former bill had rendered this impossible. To make any thing of this, they must shew that the remission of these penalties was avoidable; that four or five hundred thousand pounds, he believed, of penalty, incurred by acts for which the parties were not blameable, inasmuch as the service required was wholly out of their power, for which many of them were even meritorious, inasmuch as the impossibility arose from the restriction which they had imposed upon themselves of not breaking the law, could be levied without a degree of injustice which nothing could authorize. If this could not be shewn, the return to the measure was not precluded by any other cause than the vices inherent in the measure itself. Here, then, the same difficulty recurred as the country had been struggling with for the last 30 or 40 years. If the Parish bill was not fit to continue; if continuing, it could not produce to the army, at the utmost, more than 9000 men a year; if the recruiting, for a long time declining, was now further reduced by the effect of these very measures, something must be done, not so much to augment the army, as to prevent its going down, and to supply the number of men by which it must annually be diminished. The same necessity which existed for supplying the place of the Army of Reserve-bill, existed now for supplying the place of the Parish bill, or for making good at least what would have been wanting to that bill, had it been possible that it should have continued, and had it produced the whole of the 9000 men, which alone it was capable of producing. To say the truth, none of the measures that had been successively tried, down at least to the present time, had been rejected in consequence of any idle desire of change, and still less of any mean and envious spirit of jealousy on the part of persons newly succeeding to the government, and following those of whom they were the opponents and rivals. In fact, the measures were
<image src="S1V0009P0I0468"/>
<col>891</col>
most of them changed without any change of ministry, and by the very same persons who had brought them in. They were changed, either because they were found impracticable or objectionable, or because, being of a temporary nature, their continuance became useless after a certain time. On one or other of these grounds was a stop put to the several augmentations of the militia proposed in 1796, 1797, and 1802. In part the measures were found to be impracticable; in part they were rendered no longer desirable by incidents which had happened in the mean time. The Quota bill and Provisional Cavalry bill passed away without any enquiry as to the cause of their decrease, and certainly without any lamentation for their loss. These two, any more than the others, were no sacrifice to party rivalry; they died in the life-time of their parents, and were by them quietly conveyed to the family vault, without the least suspicion of their having come by their death, through any undue means. In like manner, the last of the Militia Augmentation bills which he had mentioned, that, namely, of 1802, was superseded by the authors themselves, who, finding the measure impracticable in its first form, (the price of a substitute having soon risen above the amount of the penalty,) and not likely to prove effectual, even after all the additional rigour of making the fine cumulative, had recourse to the measure of the Army of Reserve, being in fact a militia of something of a different from with something more of effect, but at the same time with more of severity. He had already observed, that no charge could be brought against those by whom this measure was superseded; if any supersession could in fact be said to have taken place, where the measure in question had ended itself. The same was true of the ministry of last year, with respect to the Parish bill. That measure had not indeed, like most of the others, ended itself: it was not even clear, that the numbers to be raised by it, though at the expence always of the regular recruiting, might not for a time have gone on increasing: but it was demonstrable that it could not finally have answered its purpose, and in the mean while the objections to it were such that all the world was crying out for its repeal. This was the state of things in which the late ministry came into office. The same difficulty remained that had subsisted all along, the difficulty namely of providing a fund from which the army might be regularly supplied; and for this the measures
<col>892</col>
adopted had not only furnished no remedy, but, for the most part, had not even attempted one. After every new turn, though a considerable addition might in the mean time have been made to the numbers of the army, the country was equally to seek for the means by which those numbers were to be maintained. The difficulty was in fact continually increasing: every new attempt in the course hitherto pursued having tended to throw new obstructions in the way of those that succeeded it. Ballot created the necessity of bounty. Bounty, rising to excess, and losing as much by desertion as it gained by recruits, created. in return the necessity of new ballot: then bounties shot up to a height, which not only stopped all ordinary recruiting, but created a burthen which it was impossible the country should long endure. Forty, 50, 60 guineas became the price of a recruit. Ballot and bounty were indeed the only resources that seemed ever to have been thought of. The whole compass of our invention, the whole scale of our music, seemed to comprise only these two notes. It was the sort of poverty of conception, reproached by some foreigner to English cookery, that we had but one sauce, and that that sauce was melted butter. The ministry which then came in, ventured an opinion, that possibly more men might be found to enter the service, if the service was made more eligible, by holding out more advantages or fewer objections. It seemed to them, that the hope of inducing men by bounties to enter into an engagement, which was to last for life, was little less than an absurdity, if it was not something worse. If the engagement was not in itself desireable, could it be hoped, or was it (he would add) to be wished, that many should be found so rash and foolish, as to be determined in their choice by the attraction of a few guineas paid in the shape of bounty? If such a resource could even be relied on, it might well be doubted, whether a government ought inconscience to have recourse to it, and so to place itself with respect to its subjects, as to be trading for ever with the ignorant and thoughtless for the purpose of inveigling them into engagements, which it was confessed, by the very form of the transaction, they were likely afterwards to repent of; this repentance moreover being of a nature to last for life. It was not a question however of duty or propriety. It was found by experience, that the military service had by degrees, and in consequence of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0469"/>
<col>893</col>
the change of times, fallen into a state in which it could no longer attract men in sufficient numbers; and that any attempt to supply by bounties what was wanting in the service itself was, as might be supposed, a vain attempt which could go but a little way towards remedying the evil. They took, therefore, the only means which, according to their ideas, could hold out a hope of success, the only means in fact which were left them, that of a general improvement of the conditions of the service in such a way as should not be attended with too great an expence, nor be inconsistent with the discipline and well-being of the army. They might have gone to the old resource, as the noble lord has done, of plundering the militia: that expedient was as open to them as to his majesty's present ministers, and required no great genius to invent, nor talents to execute. But besides that it did not meet the difficulty, and would have left the country, in a short time afterwards, just in the same situation in which all similar measures had left it, it did not appear to them a measure to be resorted to, even for the purposes for which it was good, except upon a necessity greater than that which they considered as existing.&#x2014;Whether the experiment thus made had succeeded or not, as procuring a supply for the army adequate to its consumption, it would be difficult to say that the attempt ought not to have been made, since it was by a change of this sort, that is to say, an improvement in the service, in some way or other, that a prospect of complete success could alone be afforded, and since, even if such success should be unattainable, the partial success of every other measure must be greatly promoted, by whatever should render the service more palatable to those who were to enter into it, whether voluntarily, or by compulsion. The trial hitherto made, not only shewed that the measure ought to have been tried, but that it was likely to be attended with the most complete success. To have put the army upon a footing in which it might have stood by itself without the aid of continual props and supports, was, if accomplished, no small service; but it was far from the whole which the circumstances of the country at the present moment unhappily required, and which the late ministry might flatter themselves with having effected. Against the new dangers which now threaten every country, armies alone are not a sufficient defence. When the army has been carried
<col>894</col>
to its greatest extent, means must still be looked for from the population at large, from the great mass of the community whom it is idle to talk of turning into soldiers, by whom the state must be maintained, and whom it cannot maintain, and who could not therefore be spared, even if they could be forced, except occasionally and momentarily, from the labours and occupations of common life. To devise the means by which the great mass of the inhabitants might be made to contribute to the general defence, and come in aid of the operations of the army, was the object of the Training act,&#x2014;a measure which, if the noble lord thought to decry by shewing, could he even succeed in so doing, that in the details much was still imperfect and wanting, he must be answered as Dr. Johnson answered some one who, on similar principles, was criticizing a dictionary, that he who thought to destroy the credit of a work of that sort merely by pointing out particular faults, only betrayed his own ignorance, for that no work of that nature was ever put forth, in which examples might not be found of faults of every description. Such faults he was ready to allow might exist in the Training act, but not more than would naturally be found in every similar measure. No bill of the sort in question was ever completed in the first instance, or came perfect out of the hands of the framer. Much must always be left to be supplied and corrected by trial and experience. These additions and amendments let the noble lord supply. But let him not set aside or seek to depreciate the measure, or deny that a measure of this sort, this or some other, must form a great and leading branch, the very basis and trunk he would almost say, of every system of military measures, which it would be right to adopt in the present circumstances of the world. An army is the great instrument by which a country must act, whether for foreign wars or for home defence. But an army must be supported, and, what is more, an army must be supplied. An army itself may want the co-operation of other less regular force: for which purpose, part of his system would be, as it had been, to keep on foot an establishment of corps similar to our present volunteer corps; that is to say, corps that should act as such, and under the immediate command of their own officers. But a further and still more important use to be derived from the population of any country, was to keep them in that state in which there
<image src="S1V0009P0I0470"/>
<col>895</col>
might be a sufficient portion ready at all times to supply the deficiencies, and make good the losses of the regular army, that is to say, in which there should always be a certain number of men ready enrolled and liable by law to be disposed of for those purposes, and in which the men so enrolled should be in a certain degree prepared for the service assigned, by having received as much training as it might be convenient or possible to give them. The enrollment and the legal preparation might be always complete. The training would vary according to circumstances, and must at all times be to a great degree imperfect. But a bill for such purposes must always exist, and be more or less acted upon, as long as the circumstances of the country and of the world should continue what they were. Such were the objects of the present bill, and which as far as enrollment went, the first and main object,&#x2014;was already complete or nearly so. The country had at this moment, in virtue of that bill, 200,000 men, whom his majesty might immediately proceed to train, and whom he was immediately authorized to dispose of for the purposes of defence in his regular regiments, or in any other way that he should think fit. Such a body of men so circumstanced would be no bad present to the country, even though to as late a period as that at which the preparations of the enemy should have actually begun, not a man of them should have had a musket upon his shoulder. But why was that to be their situation? The bill, if not prevented, was proceeding in its natural course, and would soon give to these men as much training as the circumstances required, as much at least as it was thought desirable to attempt consistent with a due regard not to render, the measure more burthensome or vexatious than was necessary. Difficulty, he denied there was any, more at least than must attend every measure of detail, when tried for the first time. If more training was necessary than the bill had provided, let more be given. As much had been done as seemed to be wanted at the time when the bill was brought in.&#x2014;This part of the plan of the late administration, which the noble lord seemed inclined to overlook, was, on the contrary, that one of the three members of which it consisted, which operated in the most directions, and did, more than any other, give to the whole its character of unity and system. It was not
<col>896</col>
a little which the Training bill was likely to do for the recruiting service: the volunteer establishment, such as it was meant to be under the late acts, would grow out of it altogether. This last fact was so true, that, according to the system of volunteers now proposed, there ought to be no Training act at all. The view entertained upon this subject by the late administration, and which he must contend to be the true one, was, that the volunteer service should be considered as the privilege of those, who were willing and able to contribute by their purses, as well as by their persons, but who did not choose, for whatever reasons, to subject themselves to the compulsion of the Training act. Three classes of persons were supposed: those to whom service in person, in whatever mode, either was, or was considered to be, a burthen, but who were ready to contribute their money; those who were willing to serve, but who wished to be indulged in the privilege of serving in corps by themselves, and under officers of their own; those, lastly, who having either not the wish or not the means to purchase one or other of the above exemptions, yet being comprised within time prescribed limits of age and stature, and not included in any special exception, must be content to perform their share, by no means a severe one, of the common duty, upon the terms, which the act had laid down. But it would be the cruellest and most unjust of all proceedings, if persons so circumstanced, were, in addition to their personal service, to be called upon to contribute to the expences of those who were allowed to perform that service, upon terms more agreeable to themselves; if the poor were thus to be called upon to pay for the privileges of the rich. This must be the case if volunteers were no longer to serve, agreeably to what had been supplied by the acts of last year, at their own expence. The acts of last year had provided, that volunteers already enrolled should be allowed to continue, with the exception only of certain special cases, upon the same rate of allowances, which they had before enjoyed; but that all who should engage hereafter, instead of being trained under the general act, should serve in corps of their own, with the condition of never being compellable to serve out of those corps, should be required to serve at their own charge. A more just condition could not well be conceived, nor one, in consequence, from which the departure would be more unjust with
<image src="S1V0009P0I0471"/>
<col>897</col>
respect to those on whom such departure must be the means of imposing an additional burthen. The condition was indeed as judicious as it was just: a due provision was thereby made for those distinctions of rank, which in many points it was most important to preserve, and which it would rarely be desirable to confound, even on those points which might seem to regard more the feelings of the individual than the interests of the community. The force thus provided would not only cost the public nothing,&#x2014;a circumstance that he believed would be found hereafter of some account when the charges should come in upon the system as then established&#x2014;but would consist precisely of the description of persons, selected as by a rule, whom you would wish to have in it, and be limited to the extent to which alone it would be desirable that it should be carried. No rule could probably be invented which would distinguish with such exactness those whom it would be desirable to collect into volunteer corps, from those who would be left with more advantage to be disposed of by the executive government, (to be distributed for the most part into the regular and militia regiments,) than that which resulted from the single condition prescribed by the act, namely, that all persons serving in future in volunteer corps, should serve at their own, expence. With a view to police, a most important consideration in the establishment of the force in question, nothing could be more desirable than that those entrusted with arms and subject so little to any military controul, should be persons of some substance and stake in the country. Even in a military view, a certain portion of corps composed of men in the higher ranks, similar to those that we meet with in the history of the times of Charles I., might be of the most distinguished use, and render services not to be accomplished by any other means. Such was the volunteer force which the late system of measures would have given the country, arising naturally and insensibly out of the measure (the Training act), of which the noble lord was disposed to make so little account, and forming a contrast which he hoped the house and country would not lose sight of, with the volunteer force as before subsisting, and as now intended to be re-established. He for one was fully convinced not only that the plain and simple plan adopted last year, was the best that could have been chosen, but that it
<col>898</col>
was the only one, consistent at least with sense and reason, which the nature of things afforded. In respect to the particular part to which allusion had last been made, viz. the Training act, it was that which could not be withdrawn without weakening the measure throughout, and in part entirely destroying it. It was the sole foundation and basis of what was proposed as the volunteer force; it was the source to which the army must look for an immediate and instant supply in case of invasion: it would, in the mean while, contribute, probably, most powerfully to the recruiting service: it would have the constant effect of training the people gradually to arms, and of preparing them for the great dangers, to which they must long look to be exposed. A Training act of some sort or other there must be. He had no claim to originality on this point. He had stated from the first, when introducing the measure, that, he took for his model, and was anxious to be understood as doing so, the measure of a similar sort introduced by a former administration, adhering to the same whenever he could, and departing from it only, as he would wish his own to be departed from, where, by later and further consideration, mistakes might be corrected, or improvements introduced. Were a scheme of national defence to be prepared entirely from the beginning, he should be disposed perhaps (though it was a question of nice consideration) to make it consist of three only out of the four members, of which our present force consisted, viz. the army, the volunteers, and the Training act, leaving out that great and now most important part, the militia. But it was one thing to say upon any subject, what should have been done originally, and another, what was proper to be done with things already formed and established. It might have been better possibly, that the militia hsd never been established; but it was a far different question, whether you would now abolish a force of that description, making often more than a half of your army at home, and wrought to its highest possible perfection. Upon these grounds the late administration abstained carefully from every thing, by which the militia force could be injured or weakened. It would have been just as easy to them as it is now to the noble lord, to make a large addition to the army, by robbing to the same amount the militia. Such a measure had in fact, many temptations to them which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0472"/>
<col>899</col>
it had not even to the noble lord; and might have been adopted also, in the then state of the country, upon infinitely better grounds, and with far less risk and inconvenience than it was by the noble lord at that moment. A measure of that sort would have given a great, real and a still greater apparent activity to the new regulations for the improvement of recruiting. It could not be that the ministers of the day were incapable of imagining such an expedient, or that all the inventive talents of the noble lord were necessary to repeat a measure which had been already tried, ever and over, and which, to say the truth, never required originally any greater force of mind or thought than that which consists in wishing for what you want, and taking it when you have the power. The house would hardly fail to remark the whimsical circumstance, that those who doubted of the original expediency of a militia force, were the persons to preserve it when established, and that the noble lord, and others its friends and champions, were those who began the work of its demolition. With these changes in the thing itself, and these proofs of the disposition of those to whom its fate was committed, he had only to entreat of the hon. gentlemen that they would put an end to the measure altogether, and would not keep it in a state in which it was nominally to subsist, while all its real virtue and efficacy was withdrawn. When the noble lord was dealing out his opinions about the practicability or impracticability of the Training act, the house would recollect, that he (the noble lord) was in the situation of the man, who wished the oracle to declare whether the sparrow was alive or dead, which he held in his hand. The noble lord had nothing to do but to give a squeeze, to verify at any time his own predictions. Nothing as yet had caused any difficulty in the execution in the Training act, but the unfortunate substitution of the militia lists in the room of those originally intended, and which certainly, as it now appears, would have been far more correct as they were likely to be more suitable to the ends proposed. It was a point on which he had yielded to the judgement of person more conversant with such matters that himself, but whose judgement had certainly proved erroneous in that instance. The pleasantry of the noble lord on that provision of the bill which required the attendance of the constable, was both un-
<col>900</col>
lucky in itself, and still less fortunate in its application. If it could have wounded any body, it must have been a gentleman to whom the noble lord was disposed to pay compliments, the right hon. gent. opposite, (Mr. Yorke) by whom the clause was first introduced, and from whom Mr. W. had only the merit of borrowing it. But in truth the joke was perfectly harmless. It was a very good one when the noble lord first heard it, (for it was not new,) but somehow or other it missed fire in his hands. In truth, what more proper person could be found than the constable to keep order among men, all of them of his own parish or district, who, not being yet soldiers, would, if not placed under the controul of some civil officer, be under no controul at all? A much severer blow than all the noble lord could inflict by his wit, or than had in fact been inflicted in any other way, was now levelled against the success of the measure, by the option which it was proposed to give to those who entered from the militia, of entering, if they should think fit, for life. This little clause, so moderate in its operation, so reasonable in its pretexts, so innocent in the eyes of those by whom the subject had been but little considered, so well understood by those by whom the clause was brought in, was just the most mischievous, as well as the most dexterous stroke that could have been contrived by persons who wished the destruction of the measure, and were not disposed for the moment openly to avow their hostility. It was a stroke given by a poisoned dagger, which, though it might make a wound no bigger than the scratch of a pin, would soon be the means of spreading disease and gangrene over the whole body. It had been observed repeatedly, that the great effect to be hoped for from the measures of last year, must depend on the opinion that would be entertained of their stability, on the confidence to be placed in them, founded in the assurance that they would not be departed from or made the cover for designs other than those which they professed to have in view. Confidence, as had been remarked on some occasion by the late lord Chatham, was a plant of slow growth in an aged bosom. It might be said with equal truth, that it was a plant of slow growth in ignorant bosoms. Ignorance was always prone to suspicion; and besides that the persons to whom measures of this sort were addressed, and upon
<image src="S1V0009P0I0473"/>

whom they were to operate, were among the most illiterate and the most ignorant, something far short of ignorance might be allowed to be suspicious, on a subject where, for a long series of years, deceits and impositions of one sort or another had, he feared, been so repeatedly practised. The moment it came to be understood, that the system of last year was to be changed in any part, all confidence in what was left, and all reliance on what was to happen in future, would be, if not at an end, at least greatly impaired. It would be in vain to tell the people, that nothing was changed but what depended upon their option; that they were still at liberty to enter as before for a limited term, and that faith in that case would be equally kept with them. The general impression remaining upon their minds, and upon the minds of those by whose opinions and feelings their own would be governed, would be, that a change had taken place in that which they had been told would be permanent, and that the same security no longer subsisted, that what should be held out to them as the condition of a soldier, should continue to be so a few years hence. It was not to be supposed, indeed, that even without this change, the confidence of the people in the measures of last year had attained to any thing like its <i>maximum</i>, or that it would perhaps for a period of several years have become so fully established, as to give to the country the entire benefit of that system. That distrust upon such subjects was not wholly unreasonable, was proved pretty clearly by the present events. The measure could hardly be considered as having reached its maturity, till service for seven years as a soldier should have become as familiar to the minds of the people, as service for seven years in an apprenticeship; till they should have seen the examples of men returning after such service, and exhibiting a living proof among their friends and relations, that promises of this kind were really meant to be kept, and were not liable to be changed by every change which might happen to take place among the rulers of the state. Conformable to these views was the experience of what had already passed. The first great pledge which operated with the people respecting the late measures, was the increase of allowance, the payments on which commenced only at Christmas last, to the Chelsea pensioners. Then they began to see proofs that the government was in earnest, that all which
<col>902</col>
they had heard upon the subject was not mere talk. These proofs, fortunately for the country, these and some other parts of the late system would still continue to operate, and would promote the success of the hon. gentleman's measures even in spite of themselves. There were parts, which the hon. gentlemen, with all the laudable spirit of mischief by which they had shown themselves to be actuated against the measures of last year, had not yet ventured to touch, and of which they would, on the contrary, be very glad to transfer the benefit to themselves. Had the benefit thus produced, been suffered to remain with the system which gave it birth, and to which it might seem of right to have belonged, had all the parts of that system been suffered to work together, according to the views of those who originally framed them it is not too much to say, that they would have risen more and more, the longer they had continued, in the estimation of the country; that they would have improved upon acquaintance; that as it would, and as it had, far outstript its competitors in the outset of its course, so it was not a measure which was likely to lose on longer trial the advantages which it had once obtained. If ever there was a measure formed on principles having a view to permanency, composed of materials which were likely to last, which, being good from the beginning, was for a long time certain to improve and never to grow worse by keeping, it was the measure to which he was alluding. The hon. gentlemen knew and felt this, and were determined therefore betimes to destroy it. Though for this intention he could not be supposed to feel much good will towards them, he might have felt more respect had they sought to execute their purpose upon better pretexts and by nobler means. The pretexts indeed did not depend wholly upon themselves: they must take up with such as they found or such as they could make. He was happy to think that in neither way their success had been such as could make it much a subject of congratulation. There was no pretence to say, that the measure had not succeeded, in the period for trial which had yet been given, to the full extent of what its authors had ever promised. In the last six months, the produce of the bill had exceeded what had been raised during the corresponding period, by the ordinary recruiting and the Additional Force act put together. This was all that need be required. No one had ever objected to the Additional
<image src="S1V0009P0I0474"/>
<col>903</col>
Force bill upon the score of its not being likely to raise, men. The objection was to the means which it employed, to the expence which it incurred, to the lasting evils which it would entail upon the country. When it was considered, moreover, that the men raised under this act might be received at a standard lower, by two inches, and of an age higher by fifteen years, than in the regular army, that is to say, at 5 feet 2 inches, instead of at 5 feet 4 inches, and between 18 and 45, instead of between 18 and 30, to have exceeded at once the produce of that bill, joined to the <i>undiminished</i> produce, according to the hon. gent., of the ordinary recruiting, was a degree of success, in the early stages of the measure, with which the authors of it might well be satisfied. He for one had never promised himself, and assuredly had never ventured to promise others, that it would attain, so soon after its commencement, a degree of success exceeding, or even equal to that which he had stated. So far as to success.&#x2014;It could as little be stated that the measure had, as yet at least, produced, or showed a tendency to produce, any of those evils which had been predicted of it, in respect to its effect on the feelings or character of the soldier, or on the discipline of the regiment. Such an objection, so far as related to the mixing of men upon different terms of service, would come with an odd grace from those, who were now studiously and wantonly augmenting that inconvenience, by an infusion of men, not only serving for different periods, but serving for different periods with men raised at one and the same time with themselves. Formerly, when this consequence had been so much objected to; though then even, (by the way,) with the most perfect inconsistency on the part of those who had been concerned in the Army of Reserve or Additional Force acts; the men who came in for term of years were men raised professedly upon a new system, and were to be added to those who had entered the army before the system in question had been introduced or thought of. Many of these, from the length of their past service, were not further removed from the period of their discharge than those who had newly entered upon a term in itself shorter. None could complain, or feel even any discontent, that others had the benefit, and without prejudice to themselves, of a change of system which had not taken place till after their time. Of part of the benefits of this change they
<col>904</col>
had been made to partake; and it had been objected to him more than once, he must confess not wholly without reason, that he had not followed up his own professed intentions in that respect, by giving to all who were then serving. and whose period of service amounted to not less than 21 years, the option of retiring, should they be so disposed. He was fully persuaded both that such permission ought to have been given, and that it would have been attended with the most beneficial effects: and it was not without much regret that he found the opinion of others different from his upon that point, more especially after the expectation which had been held out, though certainly such expectation has not amounted, with respect to the soldier, to any direct pledge. But, in point of fact, no injury had yet arisen to the service of the army from any of these sources, even if the measures of the hon. gent. were calculated to afford a remedy, or it they did not on the contrary directly tend to introduce the evil of which they formerly affected to be so apprehensive. In the mean time, he was happy to find that the general judgment of military men, and the general sentiment of the country at large, confirmed his statement, notwithstanding that the known inclination of government might operate even without any exertion of undue influence, to give a different turn to the opinions of those dependent upon them. If it was true, as the noble lord said, that the British army could not at any time derive a sufficient supply from the volunteers alone, this was a serious grievance. Such had not been the case formerly, and his measure would provide a supply for future exigencies, in the number of persons retiring with persons, at the end of their times of service, who would be liable to be called forth again upon such exigencies. So far as he was himself concerned, he wished his measure to be repealed, as he was sure it would not be allowed a fair trial. He denied the existence of an emergency sufficient to justify the breaking up of the militia, and the overturning of the new system. If such an emergency did exist, he would prefer a direct ballot into the line as the means of meeting it. It was not true that the regular army was in a continued state of decrease. It had increased in 1804; it had increased in 1805; and notwithstanding a reduction of 3000 men at Ceylon, there had been an increase of 8000 men from March 1806 to March 1807. The
<image src="S1V0009P0I0475"/>
<col>905</col>
new measure according to its last rate would afford a supply of 24,000 men a year, which was 11,000 above the common casualties as commonly calculated. The measure was now in the hands of his majesty's ministers, who would probably act by it like a parish nurse, stinting its meals, disturbing its rest, and giving it a sly pinch as often as opportunity offered. He would move for further returns, though the sense of the country was so clear that it, seemed superfluous to take further pains to shew the success of his measure. He had said that it would be useful to commence the system of discharges by dismissing those who had been 21 years in his majesty's service. He was sure these men would have been immediately replaced by others induced by their example to come forward; such would be the effect of other cases of discharge also. His opinion, however, had been surrendered to persons whose judgment he respected, and who thought otherwise. He had given no pledge, of course no engagement was broken. With respect to the employment of our troops on foreign service, the troops sent to Alexandria, had gone not from home but from the Mediterranean, where they had been sent by the late ministers. He should, if called upon, be ready to argue the policy of the expedition. The sufficiency of the number of troops sent was another question. There had been every reason to think that the expedition had been undertaken with the concurrence of the natives. Under these circumstances, and if it had not been for the misconception that led to the disasters that befel our troops, they would have been able to maintain themselves unhurt. With respect to the expedition to South America, it was undertaken not by the choice of the late government&#x2014;it was undertaken contrary to orders, by an officer who, it was to be presumed, acted not improperly in undertaking it, as he was again in employ. [Hear! hear! from the opposition.] It became necessary to send out aid as soon as the first account was received. The promptitude and sufficiency of that aid he was ready to maintain; for the delay in the passage of general Craufurd's expedition, the late government was not culpable. No expedition had ever sailed from this country better manned and found. No force had ever enjoyed better health, or suffered so very little by casualties. All the letters received from the fleet spoke in the highest terms of the general to whom the merit
<col>906</col>
of this was given, as well as to the naval officer commanding, to whom he was glad to have an opportunity of doing this justice, as he knew the arts practised to injure him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Herbert</member> <membercontribution>expressed much regret, that at the time of the union something more effectual had not been done to assimilate and in some measure identify the constitution and services of the militias of the two countries. If such an assimilation in all respects could be effected between these two bodies, the advantages resulting from it to the military strength of the empire would be incalculable. He had only to wish that the noble lord (Castlereagh) had proposed some measure to that purpose, at the time when he had it so much in his power to exert the influence and weight of the situation in which the noble lord was then placed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Shaw Lefevre</member> <membercontribution>thought the Army of Reserve act was the best military system this country had ever seen. When the late ministers quitted office, there were 600,000 effective men ready to defend the country, and he defied the present administration to keep up such a mass of military force, by their new systems.&#x2014;The question was then put from the chair, and leave was given to bring in the bills moved for by lord Castlereagh.&#x2014;The noble lord then brought up a bill "for allowing a certain proportion of the militia in Great Britain voluntarily to enlist into his majesty's regular forces;" and also, a bill "for the speedily completing the militia of Great Britain, and increasing the same, under certain limitations and restrictions;" which were read a first time.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>The Earl of Hardwicke</member> <membercontribution>rose to state his promised objections to it, which he pronounced to be perfectly inadequate to its purposes, and indeed wholly useless. The urgent and notorious want of parsonages in Ireland, must have been felt by every friend to the Protestant establishment in that country, and he was sorry to see no grounds whatever urged for the necessity of the present measure, by which it did not appear that any sums necessary for carrying into effect the object of the bill were at all provided for, or were certain to be forthcoming.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[EAST-INDIA BONDS BILL.] Mr. Hobhouse</member> <membercontribution>brought up the report of the East-India Bonds bill. On the question that the amendments of the committee be read a second time,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Peter Moore</member> <membercontribution>entered into a detailed statement of the affairs of the East-India company, in order to shew that its debts and embarrassments were the consequence of measures which had been forced upon the company, by the government and board of controul, for the effects of which, the company ought not to be responsible. It was in consequence of such measures, that the wars which had taken place in India, had embarrassed the company, that the participation on the part of the public had taken place but once, and contended, therefore, that the public had a right not only to make good to the proprietors their stock, to the amount of 12 millions, but also to discharge the whole of the floating debts of the company.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>replied, that that was not the time for entering into a detailed examination of the India accounts. It was a most extraordinary doctrine to maintain, that the expence of wars undertaken for the defence of the company's territories should be defrayed by the public. As to what had been said respecting the participation on the part of the public, he should only answer, by referring the hon. gent. to the act, in which there was an express exception of times of war.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>declared it to be his intention to resist the further progress of this bill, at least until the India accounts should be before the house, and the ground of his opposition was, that by the papers upon the table, the affairs of the company appeared to be in a dilapidated state.</membercontribution></p>
<col>908</col>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>could notagree in the position of his hon. friend, that the public should be responsible for the sums to be borrowed under this bill, or for any other of the East-India company's debts; and unless it should be understood from an explicit protest, a resolution of that house, that, by sanctioning this measure, it did not make the public a guarantee for the debts to be incurred under it by the India company, he could not consent to the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>was surprized that any doubts could be entertained upon this subject, after the manner in which it had been discussed on a former night. Undoubtedly, by passing this bill, that house was no more bound to guarantee the debts contracted pursuant to its provisions, than it was bound to guarantee the debts of any private company or corporation, authorized by act of parliament to raise money for the purposes of its institution. The money, in this instance, was to be raised on the sole responsibility of the company, to which alone, and not to the public, the lender was to look for the repayment of the sums he advanced.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Creevey</member> <membercontribution>should support the opposition of his noble friend to the further progress of the measure, unless he should be given to understand that the third reading would not be pressed before the end of next week, by which time he understood the India papers would be before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grant</member> <membercontribution>argued against the supposition that the public guaranteed these bonds, in allowing them to be issued. He contended, that the exclusive charter of the East-India company was the only means of preserving India to this country. The contingencies on which a participation in the company's profits had been promised to the public, had been retarded and prevented by a state of war. They had been calculated to accrue upon a prospect of peace.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>argued, that the fear of the eventual liability of parliament arose from the want of sufficient proofs of the validity of the company's security, which parliament was bound to ascertain, before it should give its sanction to the issue of the Bonds. After some further explanation, the amendments were agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>insisted that time should be allowed to make enquiry into the solvency of the company before any farther proceedings on the bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[IRISH INSURRECTION BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion for going into a committee on this bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, he assented to the bill's going into a committee, from the assurance he had received of the present alarming state of the country from others, besides those who now directed its government, and because he hoped to find it in a much less objectionable shape when it came out of the committee. To the preamble in particular, he must object <i>prim&#x00E2; facie,</i> as not applicable to the state of the country now, compared with its situation in 1796, when the bill originally passed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>spoke to the same effect. The preamble was grounded on the circumstances existing in Ireland, in 1796, which were very opposite to the circumstances of the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>did intend to propose an alteration of the preamble.<lb/>
On the reading of the clause for enacting the capital punishment of persons convicted of being present, aiding, abetting, and assisting, in the administration of unlawful oaths, some discussion took place. Sir J. Newport, Mr. Whitbread, lord H. Petty, and Mr. Grattan, were desirous the clause should be so worded as not to involve innocent persons, accidentally present, in the room where such unlawful oaths might be tendered, but without their knowledge or assistance, in a capital punishment: and therefore it was proposed to word the clause, "present, and knowingly and wilfully aiding," &amp;c. Sir A. Wellesley, the Attorney-General, Mr. Simeon, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Croker, were of opinion, that the clause was worded in the ordinary legal language of all indictments for similar crimes; and that it was impossible to find a man capitally guilty under it, unless it should be proved, that, beside being present, he was knowingly and wilfully guilty of aiding, abetting, and assisting, and that therefore, the change proposed would be only an unnecessary translation of the well-known and explicit language of the law, into that of common parlance. The clause was agreed to in its original form.&#x2014;Amongst the various amendments and new clauses that were proposed, there was one suggested by sir J. Newport, on
<col>910</col>
the clause which gave a power to the magistrates to arrest strangers in their several districts. The amendment proposed was, that a power should be given to the lord lieutenant, or the magistrates at the quarter sessions, to release the party arrested, on giving good security for his appearance, where nothing particular appeared to charge him with any act of criminality. It was contended, on the part of government, by col. Vereker and others, that the power might be vested in the lords lieutenants, who might be supposed to be possessed of all the information necessary to know whether the party ought to be detained or not; but that it ought not to be given to the magistrates, because their party divisions were so great that some of them would be glad to release a prisoner, because he was committed by a magistrate of the other party. On the other hand, it was argued by Mr. Whitbread, sir J. Newport, and Mr. Morris, that if such divisions amongst the magistrates did exist, the house should be more cautious how they gave up the liberty of the subject without sufficient guards; and that strangers, as they were denominated in the bill, could only be Irishmen coming from some other county, or perhaps from the next parish, or, it might be, from the next street, or the next door, as the word stranger was undefinable. A division took place, on which there was, for sir J. Newport's amendment, 18; against it, 27. The clause was then so far modified that the magistrates should be compelled to transmit to the lord lieutenant the story of the stranger, or other accused person, along with his accusation.&#x2014;The other clauses of the bill were agreed to, without any material amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>In a committee on the expiring laws bill, Mr. Rose moved a resolution for continuing to the 25th of March next, the act for suspending certain penalties in the woollen manufacture. Lord Milton urged the importance of coming to a final adjustment of the differences existing between the various classes of persons concerned in the woollen manufacture. With a view to accelerate this final adjustment he moved, as an amendment. that the duration of the Suspension act should be limited to four weeks after the commencement of the next session of parliament. Mr. P. Moore stated, that an arrangement of the differences in the woollen
<image src="S1V0009P0I0478"/>
<col>911</col>
manufactories had for upwards of five year engaged the attention of the house by a committees. All the parties were tired of dissention, and more desirous than ever to come to a final arrangement. Mr. Huskisson said, government was anxious to forward by all means in its power the final arrangement of the differences which had so long existed. After a few words from Mr. Rose, it was agreed that the chairman should report progress, and ask leave to sit again, with a view to consider in the interval how the speedy adjustment of the existing differences could be best provided for.&#x2014;Mr. Sheridan presented several petitions from the Brewers, Distillers, and Publicans of Middlesex and Surrey, against the abuse of the powers exercised by the magistrates of those counties with respect to publicans' licences. The petitions were ordered to lie on the table. Mr. Sheridan gave notice, that he would next week submit a measure for the relief of the grievances complained of by the petitioners.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH INSURRECTION BILL.] Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>moved the committal of the Irish Insurrection bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>proposed an amendment in the clause, enacting, that a serjeant or barrister at law should preside at each of the county meetings for trying offenders under the bill. The house divided: For the amendment, 29; against it, 53.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>stated, that gross abuses, as he knew from local information, had prevailed in the searching of houses, particularly with respect to females, who had in some cases been indecently outraged. He wished, therefore, for an amendment in the clause respecting the searching of houses after sun-set. The amendment which he would propose was, That the magistrate should make out a list of proper persons to be employed for this purpose, for the approbation of the quarter sessions, and that he should be responsible for the good behaviour of such persons in the discharge of their duty. If this could not be adopted, and he foresaw no objection to it from the chance that persons so approved of might not be present at the time they might be wanted, he would then propose that the magistrate should be bound in a penalty of 100<i>l</i>. to send in the names of the persons employed to the quarter sessions within 48 hours after they should have been engaged in such search, that he might, in this way, become in some respect responsible. A strong check was necessary
<col>912</col>
on such a power as this, and unless this amendment, or something equivalent to it, was adopted, he would oppose the clause altogether, and divide the house on it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley and the Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the principle of the latter amendment, but wished it should be delayed till the report of the bill, that they might have time to consider whether it could be adopted in consistency with other necessary objects.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Croker</member> <membercontribution>proposed an amendment to the clause, substituting instead of the words, "and in case of refusal to enter by force," the following words, "and in case admittance shall be refused tea minutes after being demanded, then such magistrates and their officers, bailiffs, &amp;c. shall be allowed to break into said dwelling by force."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Vereker</member> <membercontribution>disapproved of the words, "ten minutes;" he thought such amendments would go to fritter away the bill altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir S. Romilly</member> <membercontribution>was astonished, that in the case of so serious a nature as forcible entry into the house of the king's subjects, a provision to give that subject a reasonable time to provide against that forcible entry by voluntarily admitting the officer, should be termed by any gentleman in that house an attempt to fritter away the bill. It was a clause not so much of relaxation as of common justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Vereker</member> <membercontribution>explained, and said that there was another objection to such precise mention of the time, that unless there was moonlight, or that the bailiffs had lights and matches, it could not be ascertained.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Barry</member> <membercontribution>said, that another objection was, that the majority of such officers were not individually worth a watch.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>ridiculed such objections, and contended that the "ten minutes" should be distinctly specified.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the amendment, provided the words "a reasonable time" were put for the words "ten minutes," for if an entire village was to he searched, ten minutes waiting at the door of every house in that village would be an unconscionable length of time; he proposed, therefore, the substitution of the words "a reasonable time."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Croker</member> <membercontribution>acquiesced in the substitution proposed by the right hon. gentleman.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread and sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>commented forcibly on the vagueness of the terms suggested by the chancellor of the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0479"/>
<col>913</col>
exchequer, and expressed their surprise that the hon. gent. with whom the amendment had originated, could be so readily induced to give up the principal point in it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Laing</member> <membercontribution>instanced the definite time expressly limited in the riot act, and thought the present case as more deeply involving the rights of the subject, than the dispersion of a lawless mob by force of arms; he thought the hon. gent. (Mr. Croker) had been indeed hasty in giving way to certain authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Croker</member> <membercontribution>said, in justification of himself, that he was but a young member of parliament, and that it was natural for him to bow to authority; besides, he thought that the right hon. baronet over the way approved of the words "a reasonable time," [here sir J. Newport expressly signified his dissent]; however, he was himself inclined to think the final words "ten minutes," better than those last proposed, though he should not wish to divide the committee upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>said that the committee were about to invest an extraordinary power somewhere. It ought therefore to be done with caution: but who were the persons to be invested with the power? perhaps some lawless miscreant, some vagabond, or perhaps the discretion of their "reasonable time", was to be lodged in the bosom of any convenient menial, some postilion, coachman, hostler, or ploughboy, who under the sanction of the law was to judge when it would be a reasonable time for him to rush into the apartment of a female, while she was hastily throwing on her clothes, to open the door to this midnight visitor; this would give a wound that would be felt long; it would throw a general odium about the bill. If the character of the bill would be saved, any thing admitting the possibility of such abuse should be sacrificed to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. J. C. Beresford</member> <membercontribution>said, that a stranger who had heard the last twenty minutes conversation, would be apt to suppose that the Irish magistrates had a general propensity to break open doors and burst into ladies' bed-chambers. He vindicated the Irish magistracy, and said, that he did not speak there as a party-man, but as an Irishman.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Abercrombie</member> <membercontribution>was convinced, from what came within his own knowledge, of the necessity of great caution in the case now before the committee. He thought it much better to have the time ascertained by law.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor-General</member> <membercontribution>thought that the
<col>914</col>
committee was arguing wide of the case in point. The question was not about the principle of forcible entry, that was agreed to; the right of the domiciliary visit was admitted on all sides, and the question simply was, whether "a reasonable time" were words better fitted for the purpose had in view than the words "ten minutes?" he for his part thought they were, and put different cases, each of which he thought bore him out in his opinion; some of those cases might not be thought very probable; but, surely, any of them were more probable than that put by the right hon. gent. (Mr. Grattan), of the lady or the female in her bed-chamber. He did not, he confessed, feel so nicely on the subject as that right hon. gentleman.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>said, that the learned gent. had told the committee what it ought to argue upon, and what it ought not to argue upon. It was good in that learned gent. to give the committee the aid of his instruction: but is the gentleman, said Mr. Grattan, quite sure of being himself altogether right? In the first place, all the other questions are not wholly gone by; for I may agree to the clause or its modification, or reject both, and afterwards agree to or dissent from the principle of the bill itself. Again, has the learned gent. been right in his statement of the question? He has argued on the propriety of vesting the magistrate with the discretion of judging of the "reasonable time;" but this is not the question. It is, whether you vest any commissioned ruffian with that discretion? Here, then, the learned gent. mistated what he was to argue upon and then did he even argue fairly on that mistatement?&#x2014;No; for he takes that as impossible which I myself have known to have taken place. He says, such ruffians as I describe could never have been officially employed, and have made their office the pretence of wanton ou<ob/>rage: but I have known such ruffians to have been employed, and such outrages to have been committed&#x2014;[Hear! hear!]&#x2014;that delicacy of the other sex has been grossly obtruded on and wantonly insulted&#x2014;this was no light matter&#x2014;there was more in that sentiment than a joke could do away&#x2014;the honour of a female in any class&#x2014;it was wrong to make it the subject of parliamentary jocularity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>and sir S. Romilly followed on the same side, both gentlemen's ating, that their right hon. friend (Mr.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0480"/>
<col>915</col>
Grattan) had put the question in its true light. It was not investing the magistrate, but his menial bailiff, with a dangerous discretion.&#x2014;Mr. Laing having proposed the amendment in its original form, Mr. Croker said, that as he had not withdrawn his amendment, he should not give it up.
&#x2014;The committee then divided,

On the following clause, "Provided always, and be it further enacted, that when a verdict shall be given for the plaintiff in any action to be brought against any justice of the peace, peace-officer, or other person, for taking or imprisoning, or detaining any person, or for seizing arms, or entering houses under colour of any authority given by this act, and it shall appear to the judge or judges before whom the same shall be tried, that there was a probable cause for doing the act complained of in such action, and the judge or court shall certify the same on record, then and in that case the plaintiff shall not be entitled to more than 6<i>d</i>. damages, nor to any costs of suit,"</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Brand</member> <membercontribution>moved that the whole clause be omitted, as grossly unjust and unconstitutional.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>admitted that the clause was not one which he could have wished to see introduced: but, when the necessity of the case was considered; when it was recollected that the state of Ireland required that very irksome and disagreeable duties should be imposed on the magistrates, winch they would be unwilling to perform, and which, in fact, it would be dangerous, for them to perform with the zeal and fidelity required, unless they were protected from the effects of unintentional errors into which, from appearances, they might be led; when, in short, it was considered that the very jurors in such actions of damages might be persons against whom it had been necessary for them to exercise the enactments of this act, and whose minds might, of that account, be inflamed against them; when all these things were considered, it was the opinion of those best acquainted with the state of Ireland, that the act must be imperfectly executed, unless the magistrates were secured by a clause like the present.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Arthur Pigott</member> <membercontribution>said, he was decidedly of opinion, that the provision now objected
<col>916</col>
to, would be a disgrace to the statute book. Were they, by this most extraordinary bill, to give extraordinary powers to magistrates, and then, after they had exceeded even the powers given them, to protect them from the verdict of a jury? If the right hon. gent. was afraid that the persons aggrieved might obtain a verdict while the country was in a state of irritation, why limit the time for seeking redress to six months? If, again, he was afraid of the inflammable state of the jurors' minds, and that they might even have been parties in the supposed transgression, the remedy was plain and easy&#x2014;to change the venue to a more distant county, where no dissatisfaction or irritation of feelings had prevailed. It had been said, that a similar act had been intended to be proposed by the late ministry. He would only say for one, that he had never been consulted, nor had heard of such an intention, nor had he ever seen the present bill till yesterday. If the state of Ireland was such as the right hon. gent. represented, and that a jury could not be had there whose minds were not in an inflammatory state, why not take away the trial by jury entirely, at least suspend it, till the feelings of the people were restored to a greater degree of calmness and composure? It was a mockery to continue the trial by jury, and yet to deprive an injured person of the effect of a verdict after it had been given in his favour. It was said, that the judges of Ireland were fair, impartial, and upright. He should be sorry to doubt it. He believed, that they, in common with the judges in this part of the kingdom, with whom he was more intimately acquainted, possessed every honourable and upright feeling and quality. But this was a power not to be intrusted to any man. It was such a power as the law had refused to any judge, or any set of judges whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Attorney-General</member> <membercontribution>contended, that the enactment now objected to was not so novel as the hon. and learned baronet had supposed. He confessed that plaintiffs in the situation alluded to were to be deprived of the benefit of the common law; but was not this already the case in all revenue questions? Where an officer of the revenue was sued, nothing but the dry damage sustained by the injured party was awarded against him. Where it was a question of intention in revenue cases, and no intention could be shewn, the plaintiff could not recover; and it had been determined, in the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0481"/>
<col>917</col>
case of Sutton and Johnston, that the question of "probable cause" was a question for the judge. There the defendant would have an acquittal, and of course his costs from the plaintiff; here the plaintiff was to have a nominal verdict, even although the judge was of opinion that the probable cause was with the defendant. The duties which magistrates would have to perform in the present state of Ireland, were of a most invidious nature, and he thought that this was not too great an indemnity to allow them in the discharge of such duties.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Boyle <memberconstituency>(solicitor-general for Scotland)</memberconstituency></member> <membercontribution>contended that the hon. and learned gent. (sir A. Pigott) had gone too far in treating the proposed resolution as so great a novelty, and as so grievous an infringement of the law and constitution of this country. If the hon. and learned gent. had consulted the statute book, he would have found that similar resolutions as to Ireland had been passed repeatedly before this time, nay that at this moment such formed a part of the law of the land. If the hon. and learned gent. had found the enactment in question so very obnoxious, why did he not come forward in his official situation, when he was attorney-general, and move that it be expunged from the statute book? He had no doubt that the hon. and learned person, when in office, agreed with his friends in the ministry in thinking the clause in dispute essential to the well-being of Ireland. He (Mr. Boyle) recollected being in the house on the evening when the present bill was introduced, and remembered perfectly well that gentlemen on every side agreed in the necessity of the measure, except one hon. gent., whom he now saw in his place, (Mr. Sheridan,) who declared, he had no doubt most conscientiously, his resolution to oppose the bill in every stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>declared, that he had not heard a legal or constitutional sentiment uttered on the subject, except what had fallen from his hon. friend behind him, (sir A. Pigott). He had, indeed, heard something like an attempt at a legal defence of the measure, by shewing that such practices also prevailed in revenue questions. But would that render the power more agreeable to law or to the constitution? Was it not known and acknowledged, that our revenue laws were infractions of our constitutional liberties, and were only tolerated as acts of necessity, which, indeed, was the
<col>918</col>
only attempt at a vindication of the present measure? The necessity of the revenue laws we must all be aware of, a great revenue could not otherwise be expected to be levied; but of the necessity of the present provision, he confessed he was by no means convinced. An hon. gent. (Mr. Boyle) had, however, treated the provision as part of the existing laws of this country, and had asked, why, if so obnoxious to his learned friend (sir A. Pigott), he had not moved to have it expunged from the statute book? A provision to the same effect he (Mr. Whitbread) admitted, did make part of a statute of the parliament of Ireland, which would expire on the 1st of August. It would have been too much however, he suspected, for his learned friend to have come forward here, and moved to have that enactment expunged. At all events, an enactment of the Irish parliament could not act as a precedent for that house, or afford any such argument for now adopting it, as if they had been re-enacting a former legislative measure of their own. There might be a general conviction of the necessity of the present act, and yet the clogging it with one clause similar to that now objected to, might render it so unpalatable that many gentlemen who, like himself, were not otherwise unfriendly to the measure, might rather wish to see Ireland take its chance than thus relinquish one of its dearest and most valuable rights. It was hardly possible, but that in the execution of such an act as the present, innocent persons should suffer wrong. Their country, however, would still be naturally dear to them, and they would cheer themselves with the hope that they had still a remedy left; that they had still a jury to protect them, and to redress the wrongs they had sustained. If the clause now objected to, however, should pass, they could have no such consolation. They might appeal to a jury; a jury might give them redress; but they might then find the judge interpose, and deprive them of that recompence for their wrongs to which they were justly entitled. He would ask, could a man in this situation have the same feelings towards his country as if no such clause had found its way into the present bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>related two cases in which the precipitancy of the magistrates had been the ru<ob/>n of two worthy individuals; the one, that of a merchant who was taken upon suspicion; 100,000<i>l</i>. bail was offered for his appearance at the necessary time; this was refused; the man's business was
<image src="S1V0009P0I0482"/>
<col>919</col>
ruined for want of his own presence to conduct it, and he became a bankrupt. He afterwards went out to America; he carried with him the disease of the mind which had thus been occasioned, became melancholy, his senses were deranged, and he made an attempt upon his life. Another person was apprehended in the county of Tipperary, because he was guilty of having a piece of French manuscript in his pocket, and by order of the sheriff he was flogged, because the sheriff in his extreme loyal zeal concluded that the manuscript must be seditious, or it would not have been written in French, a language which he did not understand. He therefore intreated gentlemen to look a little at the other side; to feel a little for the injured individual as well as for the erring magistrates.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>always considered the principle of the revenue laws a very deplorable departure from the general principles of British legislation, and could not readily be induced to think that we ought to adopt what must be in some instances an unjust exception, instead of what was an acknowledged, just, and liberal established rule. The case of Sutton and Johnston was a singular exception not extremely worthy of imitation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Vereker</member> <membercontribution>was afraid this excellent bill was in danger of being frittered away.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor-General</member> <membercontribution>said, that if this clause was omitted, all the preceding clauses might be cancelled also.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Loftus</member> <membercontribution>spoke, from his own experience, in support of the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>declared, that in every principle of justice we were bound to administer relief to the injured individual, even though it should not be done at the expence of the magistrate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>reprobated severely the injustice of the measure: as a matter of policy even, it was to be considered, that such a measure would naturally irritate men's minds&#x2014;when they felt that they had suffered damage, when they appealed to a court of justice, and a jury awarded them some compensation in damages, and yet it was not in the power of the jury to extend to the in ividual that justice to which they knew he was entitled. When he saw the verdict of the jury superseded by the decision of the judge, was that a way to reconcile the feelings of Irishmen? was that a way to bind Ireland by friendly attachment to this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>main-
<col>920</col>
tained that the decision would be strengthened, the interest of individuals would be better secured, by the opinion of the Judge and Jury being both made public. He contended that the cases to which gentlemen alluded appeared to be what the law termed <i>&#x00E1;amnum sine injuri&#x00E2;</i> and private interest must give way to public good.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>said, that if the magistrate was supposed to be innocent, that is, with respect to the <i>quo animo</i> with which he acted, and yet it was seen that an individual suffered materially, government or the country should reimburse the sufferer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Morris</member> <membercontribution>said, that if the verdict of a jury was supposed to be erroneous, the constitution had provided a legal mode of redress to the party who supposed himself aggrieved, as he might move for a new trial, then for a second, and so on to a third; and, if three juries of the county were agreed as to the same chief point, however highly he respected the character and general conduct of the judges in England and in Ireland, he must say, that he should think the verdict of three distinct juries infinitely preferable, to that of any individual who might oppose their decision, however highly venerable that individual might be seen in other respects.&#x2014;The committee then divided upon this clause, and the numbers were: For the original clause, 75; for the amendment, 28; Majority 47.<lb/>
Upon the period of "two years, and to the end of the next ensuing session of parliament," being proposed for the duration of the act,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Newport</member> <membercontribution>rose and deprecated such a period, as it implied the contemplation of a necessity which might cease long before parliament was in the habit of annually considering the Mutiny bill, and the reasons which induced that habit pleaded with still stronger force for the annual consideration of a measure of this nature, which would go to put Ireland out of the pale of the constitution. What, he would ask, would gentlemen say, if it were proposed for such, or indeed for any period, to put England in such a situation?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Vereker</member> <membercontribution>was an advocate for the clause; as was </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Phipps </member>, <membercontribution>who stated, that if England were in such a state as that of Ireland, or likely to be so, he believed that no English gentleman would be found to oppose the adoption of a measure similar to the present.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>thought that shortening
<image src="S1V0009P0I0483"/>
<col>921</col>
the duration of the bill would be a sort of pledge to the Irish people of the reluctance with which parliament imposed such an act upon them, while its present extended duration would directly indicate an indifference upon the subject. For, although the necessity for the bill might now be fully evident, still no man could presume that the period objected to might not long survive that necessity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>was decidedly of opinion that the clause ought to pass in its present stage, because there was no probability that the necessity which called for the bill would so soon cease; and also because it wits desirable to prevent the agitation of a question of this nature so often as the right hon. baronet professed to wish lest such agitation might tend to aggravate the evil which the bill was meant to cure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>deprecated the continuance of the bill for so long a term as that proposed by the clause now in discussion, and earnestly intreated the house to comply with the suggestion of his right hon. friend (sir J. Newport). The right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, he said, had argued, that this bill would cease to operate as soon as the occasion for it should cease, and that it could be no grievance where it was not in operation. He (Mr. G) denied the fact. Would the house, without any proofs at its bar, or appointing any committee to enquire into the situation of Ireland, and report on the necessity of the case, proceed to pass a bill, abrogating in Ireland for three years, the rights of the constitution, merely because, at present, there was a manifest disposition in some places which called for vigilance and the strong hand of coercion? Was it no grievance to declare the power of the crown absolute and to authorize government proclaim the whole or any part of the people of Ireland out of the king's peace, and liable to military execution or arbitrary transportation? But, supposing such power vested in the hands of the most wise and humane chief governor that ever existed, was it no grievance for a free people to feel themselves placed in such a predicament for 3 whole years, without any examination into the necessity of such a measure? Would the people of England think it no grievance that parliament should declare the power of the crown absolute for 3 years, even under the most mild, humane, and benevolent monarch that ever existed? He had said, that he would vote for this bill,
<col>922</col>
because he was sorry to say there existed some necessity for it. He knew it was extremely unpopular in Ireland, from the hundreds of letters he himself had received upon the subject; but still, under the existence of some necessity, he was ready to vote for the bill, and to take his own full share of the odium and unpopularity attached to it. This was a time in which every man should be prepared to sacrifice, not only some portion of his liberty, but of his popularity also, for the safety of his country: he was ready to sacrifice both, for the good of the state, because he would rather give up his situation as a representative of his country, than sacrifice public security at the shrine of popularity. He was assured by his right hon. friend near him ( Mr. Elliot, the late secretary for Ireland), that there were in various parts of Ireland, secret nocturnal meetings of a dark and dangerous nature. This called for the bill, and therefore he would vote for it, even without the modification of the clause required by the right hon. baronet. But he most earnestly intreated of the house, and of the right hon. gentleman opposite to him, not to push this bill to an extent so unnecessary, which even the Irish parliament, at a period, and in a state of things much more generally alarming, only passed for one year, afterwards for two, and lastly, in the hour of its death, just before the union, perpetuated for seven years. The feeling he wished the house to impress by this bill upon the people of Ireland was, that it was a measure of necessity, which would cease with the cause, and subside with the disposition it was intended to correct; but he seriously apprehended, that its enactment for 3 years would tend to aggravate the mischiefs it was intended to correct, because, by evincing to the people of Ireland an indifference towards extending to them British privileges, a question might arise in their minds, whether to prefer the military government of France, or the suspended constitution of England. The question in Ireland now had nothing to do with religious conflict, or republican principle, but was simply this, whether Ireland should continue a portion of the British empire; or become not a portion of France&#x2014;but absolutely nothing: for annihilation would be her fate under French conquest. He knew very well, France would have her spies in Ireland to create a French party, and to endeavour to foment a French connection, first by coquetting&#x2014; but with a certain view to mere rici<ob/>us in-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0484"/>
<col>923</col>
tercourse. This was the danger he most deprecated, and against the possibility of which he desired to caution that house, and to warn his countrymen. It was not merely by this bill, or any other measure of legal expediency, that this danger was to be avoided, but by that species of parental and friendly treatment which counsels while it restrains, and admonishes while it corrects. He would recommend the gentlemen of that country not at this crisis to content themselves with mere precaution, or rely upon measures of severity and irritation. He counselled them to go personally from hamlet to hamlet, from house to house &#x2014;to canvass the people for their country, with the same zeal with which they canvassed votes for their elections; to open their eyes to the danger and ruinous consequence of French connexion; and to hold out to them the solemn assurance of redress of all their grievances, and the abolition of all invidious distinctions and disabilities on the score of religion. [Here a cry of no! no! no!] "Gentlemen who say no, continued Mr. Grattan, know nothing of the interests of Ireland, and don't understand their own. Believe me, in this hour of peril, the aid of the people of Ireland is of the utmost importance to the empire, and you stand in need of it all. It is of the last importance, then, that you canvass for it in the way most likely to secure it. I earnestly advise, that on the subject of Catholic emancipation, which I shall not discuss now, the minds and the hopes of that people may be set at rest, by the solemn assurance that their firm and loyal adherence to England in this last and most perilous struggle, shall be the price of their complete admission to all the rights of the British constitution, consistent with reason and justice. Nations are often the arbiters of their own fate, and you have it now in your power to secure that inviolable attachment of the Irish people with which you may reckon on your security; but without which, that security, I fear, would be problematical. I again earnestly intreat gentlemen connected with Ireland, to use every means in their power to excite amongst the people an attachment to the empire, and above all to that fundamental maxim of British policy, to have nothing to do with France. I shall conclude with giving my support to the bill; in deprecating however the long term of its proposed continuance. I know my conduct may in this case be unpopular amongst many of my countrymen, but
<col>924</col>
I never will capitulate with popular error, though I shall ever respect popularity when the attendant on public virtue.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. J. C. Beresford</member> <membercontribution>congratulated the house, the country, and the right hon. gent., on the sentiments which he had just uttered, and which he hoped and trusted would have a due impression in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Loftus</member> <membercontribution>concurred in this congratulation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Howick</member> <membercontribution>deprecated the idea, that any objection offered by himself and his friends to the details of this measure, proceeded from a disposition to oppose the principle of the measure itself. On the contrary, he was anxious to support the bill, with regard to the necessity for which no change whatever had taken place in his sentiments since his retirement from office. But, as to the bill itself, he declared that although a draft of it had been sent to him from Ireland, just previous to the change of administration, he had never read it until lately introduced by the right hon. baronet.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>declared his satisfaction at the speech of the right hon. gent. which had excited so much admiration, but re-stated his reasons for proposing the enactment of the measure for two years, which nothing that he had heard could induce him to alter. If the bill was not popular in Ireland, that was to him a proof of its necessity.&#x2014;The committee then divided: For the original clause, 68; against it, 21. After which the house resumed.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member> <membercontribution>The petition complaining of undue elections and returns for the county of Kilcardine, and for the boroughs of Oakhampton and East Grimstead, were discharged, as the petitioners had failed entering into the necessary recognizances.&#x2014;Sir A. Wellesley moved for, and obtained leave to bring in, two bills; the one for allowing a certain number of men to volunteer from the Irish militia into the regiments of the line; the other for increasing the Irish militia to a certain extent, by ballot or by bounty. The bills were then brought up and read a first time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH INSURRECTION BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The report of this bill was brought up.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>proposed an amendment, that, instead of the penalty of 100<i>l.</i> on magistrates for not sending notice within three days to the quarter sessions, of the persons
<image src="S1V0009P0I0485"/>
<col>925</col>
deputed by them to receive arms, the penalty should be but 20<i>l.</i> The reason of this proposed alteration was, that it had been yesterday stated that 100<i>l.</i> would be much too large a penalty, as many of the magistrates in Ireland were not worth 100<i>l.</i> per annum.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>said, that he lamented to hear that the magistracy in Ireland was in such a degraded situation, that 100<i>l.</i> should be reckoned too severe a penalty, for a wilful neglect of duty. He, for his part, thought the penalty was not too severe, and that it would be necessary, in order to oblige them to do their duty.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>considered, that the larger penalty would, instead of producing any good effect, only tend to alarm the magistrates, and prevent men from undertaking the duties of that situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>thought it was a most serious consideration, to think what chance of justice the people of Ireland had from magistrates that were not worth 100<i>l.</i> a year; and still more, what security they would have for the good conduct of those persons which such magistrate should please to depute.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Vereker</member> <membercontribution>considered that the penalty would be a severe hardship upon the magistrates, and that it might be incurred without any wilful neglect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>thought that it would be better to take away the penalty altogether. The magistrates would still be liable to be proceeded against criminally for any neglect of duty; and if any individual should suffer injury from such neglect, that person might have his action for damages.&#x2014;After some farther conversation, it was agreed that the penalty should be taken away altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>then proposed a clause, that when arms should be surrendered in consequence of a district being proclaimed, the owners of those arms should receive them back again when the district was restored to the king's peace, or else they might sue the district for the value of them. He stated that there were innumerable instances of persons entitled to bear arms, who had registered them, and had yet been obliged to surrender those arms when the district was proclaimed, and could never get them back again. This was often a loss of considerable importance. Among other gentlemen who had so lost their arms, his right hon. friend (Mr. Grattan) was one. From his house there were taken pistols,
<col>926</col>
and other arms, silver-mounted, and of considerable value, and they were never restored to him. If those seizures were made by magistrates themselves, there would be persons responsible for them: but when those seizures were made by any body who might be appointed by magistrates, such as had been described, persons from whom arms were taken had nobody to look to for restitution. He considered that all the arms so surrendered should be deposited in certain places in the county, and restored when the troubles were over.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Foster</member> <membercontribution>considered that it would be unsafe to convey those arms through a disturbed country, to such appointed places for keeping them, and did not know how actions could be brought against a district.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer </member>, <membercontribution>although he had not disapproved at first of the principle of the clause, yet after what he had heard from his right hon. friend, he conceived it his duty to oppose it.&#x2014;The clause was then negatived.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>then proposed, as an amendment, that instead of two years being mentioned as the duration of it, it should be one year.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the motion was not regular in that stage of the bill, as it would be an amendment upon an amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>then said, that he should propose it on the third reading of the bill, and he considered it of such importance, that unless some such amendment were agreed to, he might perhaps think it necessary to take the sense of the house upon the bill itself. As the bill had now been much altered by the various amendments, he moved that it should be printed in its amended form.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir A. Wellesley</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the printing the amended bill, in order to give the fullest information to the members, but he would not pledge himself to postpone the third reading later than Monday, even if the bill should not be then printed.&#x2014;The bill was ordered to be printed.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[DISPUTE WITH AMERICA.] Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>rose to ask, whether it was the intention of his majesty's ministers to make any communication to parliament on a circumstance which was at present the subject of much conversation, he meant the report of hostilities having actually commenced be-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0486"/>
<col>927</col>
tween this country and the United States of America? He should rejoice to hear that the report was untrue; and if that was the case, he was sure the noble lord on the opposite side (lord Hawkesbury) would be glad to have this opportunity afforded him of contradicting it; but if so great a calamity had really taken place, he trusted that his majesty's ministers would lose no time in laying before parliament the grounds of the dispute between the two countries. Indeed, he trusted that parliament would in this case insist upon having full information, and that so unfortunate an event had not occurred without ministers having done every thing in their power to avoid it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>said, that the only answer he could give was, that he had no authority to make any communication at present on the subject to which the noble lord had alluded. That noble lord, however, did him no more than justice when he supposed that every thing had been done on the part of his majesty's ministers to avoid so unfortunate a result as hostilities between this country and the United States of America. No one could lament that event more than he would, if it should take place; but in that case he should certainly feel it his duty to lay before parliament, at as early a period as possible, every information which would be necessary for them to form an opinion on the subject. Their lordships, however, he was sure, must be sensible of the impropriety of any premature communication, and therefore would nut expect any from him at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>in explanation observed, that it was not his wish to urge his majesty's ministers to any premature communication. He was only anxious to take the first opportunity of expressing his sense of the calamity which was said to have occurred, and his hope that parliament would not separate without receiving full information respecting its cause.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[LONDON PORT IMPROVEMENT BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the reading of the order of the day, for the third reading of the London Port Improvement bill, which was for the advancing 30,000<i>l</i>. to the West-India dock company,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>rose and said, that he had the instruction of a very numerous class of traders in West-India produce, to oppose the bill; of the progress of which, to its present stage, he was wholly unaware, un-
<col>928</col>
til informed by mere accident, nor could he have obtained a printed copy of the bill but through the kindness of an hon. friend near him, in order to be fully apprised of its object. The persons who instructed him to oppose the bill, and the list of 60 of whom he had in his pocket, would have come forward with a petition against it, but for the very advanced period of the session. They complained of very oppressive grievances and impediments to their trade, caused by the conduct of the dock company, and they desired only to register their protest against granting to the company, by this bill, the sum proposed, and thereby further confirming their monopoly, until they should redress the grievances complained of, and which the parties aggrieved were ready to state by petition.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Alderman Shaw </member>, <membercontribution>as a member of the dock company, declared that, in the course of his experience amongst them, he never witnessed the slightest disposition on the part of the company or their servants to inconvenience, much less to oppress or injure, any man; on the contrary it was their earnest wish, as well as their interest, to give facility and accommodation to every trader resorting to those docks, to the utmost of their power; and he was convinced they would, at any time, be ready, with the utmost cheerfulness and alacrity, to remove, upon representation, every cause of complaint to the utmost of their power. Besides, he begged leave to observe that the 30,000<i>l</i>. granted by this bill, was not for the private advantage of the company, but for public purposes; namely, for building a party-wall between the outward bound, and the homeward dock, and thereby the better to prevent depredations on the ship owners, and frauds on the revenue; to build offices for the accommodation of his majesty's officers of the customs there, and to erect barracks for the convenience of the troops it was found necessary to employ, in order to prevent depredation. He therefore hoped the house, feeling the necessity of those arrangements for the completion of the West-India docks, would not, without some obvious grounds, reject the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Alderman Combe</member> <membercontribution>allowed that there were many complaints made of disappointment and impediment, such as alluded to by his hon. friend who opposed the bill, but they were such as he had no doubt the company would be ready to remove upon fair representation.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0487"/>
<col>929</col>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert</member> <membercontribution>supported the bill, defended the conduct of the company, and lamented that the hon. gent. who brought forward the objection had not himself more frequently visited the docks, and witnessed the alacrity and dispatch there evinced for public accomodation, and that he had heard the story only from prejudiced persons, whose complaints arose from their own irregularity, rather than from any fault of the company. If carts were crowded there in such numbers as rendered it impossible for them to be loaded within the hours daily appropriated to business, it was undoubtedly expensive and vexatious; but how were the company to blame? There were many, he believed, who did not like to send so far for the produce, and were averse to the docks on that account; and others who disliked them on account of the death blow they had given to smuggling, and to plunder upon the property of West-India merchants, from the moment they entered the river till they were cleared at the custom-house, which existed before those docks were erected: but the importance of those docks to the public would be better estimated by a calculation which he could prove, namely, that before the erection of those docks, the plunder of West-India produce upon the trade in London, amounted to half a million annually, besides the proportionate loss to the revenue. He trusted, therefore, the house would not, upon slight and unexamined grounds, withhold the aid proposed by this bill from an object of such public importance.&#x2014;The bill was then read a third time, and passed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[FOREIGN TREATIES AND DISPUTE WITH AMERICA.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>rose and observed, that he had waited to the last moment in the hope of seeing the right hon. the foreign secretary, in his place, that he might put to him some questions. He could not however, let the present occasion pass by without submitting these questions to the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer. It would be in the recollection of the house that the right hon. gent., whose absence he had alluded to, had on a former night, in reply to a question put by him, respecting the treaties or engagements with foreign powers, noticed in the speech at the commencement of the session, stated, that he had reason to believe, that he should be authorised to lay those treaties before the house, either the week before last, or last week at
<col>930</col>
farthest. He wished to know, then, when this communication would be made to the house. It was not his intention, however, to press for the communication, unless it could be made without inconvenience to the public service; but it was natural, in the present state of the session, that he should feel considerable anxiety to have the treaties laid before the house as expeditiously as possible.&#x2014;He had also another question to ask the right hon. gent., concerning the very alarming event, of which intelligence had been received, respecting the capture of an American frigate by a British vessel. This event was felt by him, and would be felt by every sober, and reflecting person in the nation, to be in the highest degree alarming. What he wished to ask was, whether any communication had been received by his majesty's government of the circumstances that had led to this transaction? Whether the officer concerned had acted upon instructions furnished to him by the government at home, or upon his own feeling of duty or propriety? And whether it was the in ention of his majesty's ministers, to make any communication to the house upon the subject?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer </member>, <membercontribution>in the absence of his right hon. friend, would answer the questions of the hon. gent. He assured the hon. member, that it was the intention of his right hon. friend to make the communication, he promised, to-morrow. At the same time he must observe, that his right hon. friend had not intimated, that he would lay a treaty or treaties before the house. The hon. member and the house would recollect, that, in what passed on the former night, his right hon. friend had stated only that the treaty alluded to depended upon a contingency, which contingency, if it should not take place, would render it unnecessary to produce the treaty to the house. With respect to the other question of the hon. gent, he should hope that there would be no necessity to make any communication upon the subject. What he should state at present was, tha as a member of his majesty's government, he was not in possession of all the circumstances of the case, and could not therefore make any distinct communication upon the subject. All he should say was, that if, upon receiving the necessary information, it should appear that there was any thing improper or unjustifiable in the conduct of the officer concerned, there certainly would be every wish on the part of his majesty's minis-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0488"/>
<col>931</col>
ters to make the fullest reparation that the nature of the case would admit of. He was convinced the house would feel, that it would not be just to impute blame in any quarter before a knowledge of all the circumstances of the transaction should afford the means of a fair and impartial judgment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>disclaimed any idea of imputing blame to any man, and was glad that he had asked the information, because the answer he had received from the right hon. gent. afforded him great consolation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MILITIA TRANSFER BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the question being put for the second reading of the Militia Transfer bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Robert Williams</member> <membercontribution>rose to oppose the bill. He approved altogether of the system that had been produced last year by the late ministers, and he had expected that the hon. gentlemen opposite had become converts to its merits, and that they would have had the manliness to acknowledge the fact. He called, then, on all the independent gentlemen in that house, to support their own consistency by supporting that system, which they had last year so deliberately and solemnly sanctioned. He had always been a friend to enlistment for a limited period, and he was confirmed in his opinion by the success that had attended its adoption. That system had raised 22,000 men in one year, and would continue to produce more, because the measure would be improving daily and hourly, so as in a short time, to give the country a disposeable force, adequate to every national purpose. The object of the hon. gentlemen opposite was to overturn a system that had proved so beneficial. They proposed to take from the militia, a force best calculated for defence, in order to add to the disposeable force, which was not now wanted.&#x2014;As to the inspecting field officers appointed to the volunteers, he maintained that they were of no use to the volunteers, because they had no authority over them, and could not put any corps through a single man&#x0153;uvre, without the order of the colonel. The withdrawing these inspecting field officers would save 40,000<i>l</i>. to the nation, but that was no consideration with the right hon. gentlemen opposite. The late administration had, by their measures respecting the volunteers, effected a saving of 300,000<i>l</i>. to the nation, without rendering that force less efficient. On all these grounds he felt it his duty to oppose the bill under dis-
<col>932</col>
cussion, in every stage, and should therefore move an amendment, "that the bill be read a second time this day three months."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Stanley</member> <membercontribution>also opposed the bill, because it would destroy the militia, and be oppressive to the country. The men that were to be taken from the militia, were to be replaced by the ballot. He did not approve of the measure, which held out encouragement to officers of militia to seek promotion in the line, by the number of men which they could influence to volunteer from the regiments. This would have most injurious effect upon the militia, for which it was at present so difficult to procure proper subaltern officers. In the present critical circumstances of the country, he was very unwilling to oppose any measures that might be deemed necessary, but a sense of duty obliged him to oppose this measure in every stage. If, however, the bill should pass into a law he would not throw any impediment in the way of its operation. He trusted, that in such a case, a clause would be introduced to prevent the recruiting parties or commanding officers from tampering with the men. The militia was already in a declining state, and for his part he would much rather the noble lord had brought forward a proposition for annihilating the militia altogether, than for degrading it by making it subservient to the recruiting of the army.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Willoughby</member> <membercontribution>would give his support to the measure, because at this eventful period, when the states of the continent were over-run, and when we were threatened with the same fate that had befallen other nations, vigorous measures were absolutely necessary. This measure he considered efficacious and from conversations which he had had with some militia officers, he was convinced, that if double the number proposed to be allowed to volunteer were necessary, they could be obtained readily. Here he could not but remark upon the neglect of the late ministers, who had deserted our brave allies, and lavished the force of the country by such expeditions as that to Egypt, which terminated in a disaster that tarnished the lustre of the British arms. Of the volunteers, a force so much decried by a right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Windham), whose talents he admired, but whose politics appeared to him to be too theoretical and speculative, he might truly say, that the spirit with which they had come forward had saved the country. He was of opinion that the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0489"/>
<col>933</col>
inspecting field-officers and permanent duty, were necessary to make that force efficient. The hon. gent. concluded, by expressing a hope that those dissentions which had lately prevailed amongst them, would cease, and that there would be the same unanimity in the councils, which he was sure there would be in the field.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Euston</member> <membercontribution>spoke against the bill. He admitted that the army would gain by the operation of it in the first instance. But parliament was bound to look farther, and then he would ask what, would become of the ordinary recruiting? That source of supply for the army would be effectually cut off by the effect of this measure. The ballot, by raising bounties, would destroy the regular recruiting. It was remarkable too, that the plan of the noble lord departed from the precedents of volunteering from the militia into the line. The volunteering in 1799 had not been followed by a ballot. A similar volunteering from the militia had taken place in the course of the present war, and had not been succeeded by the ballot. This constituted an essential difference between the present and the former cases. Though he objected to the whole of the measure, he might be induced perhaps to withdraw his opposition to it, if one or two points were to be ceded to him. The first was, that no proposition should be made, under any circumstances, to the men who should volunteer, to enlist for a longer term than that sanctioned by the system adopted last session. Another was, that the men who should be raised by ballot to supply the place of those who volunteered into the army, should not, in any case be called on to volunteer into the line. If these points were ceded, he might be induced to vote for the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lockhart</member> <membercontribution>most heartily approved of the measure, because, as the noble lord who proposed it had stated, it would not interfere with the regular permanent recruiting for the army. I was a temporary measure to meet a pressing exigency. This measure was not like that of the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Windham), in its infancy, but complete major at once. The soldiers it would give to the army, would be of that description emphatically designated by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Yorke) on a former night, <i>sui generis.</i> They would be men not cajoled or entrapped in an incautious moment; but men who had seen service, and who only regretted, that the
<col>934</col>
sphere in which they had moved was too narrow for their glory. It had been objected, that the measure was founded upon compulsion, but that argument would apply against all the militia laws. These laws had at first been unpalatable, and produced riots, but the good sense of the people had reconciled them to them. But if this measure were one of even greater compulsion, he would readily lend himself to its support, under all the circumstances of the country, when its inveterate foe was compelling state after state upon the continent to become subservient to his power, and would perhaps enroll them all against this country. The minister of this country ought to provide, by the energy of his measures, for its safety. That was the duty of any man, whoever he might be, that was minister, and the measures he might adopt for such a purpose would be cheerfully submitted to and supported by the people. A minister who should act in that manner with energy would stand upon the firmest ground, but he that should neglect the security of the country, by pursuing an opposite course, could not maintain himself for any time. They had seen it stated in one of the French bulletins, that the French soldiers ridiculed the Cossacks for their mode of warfare, by discharging arrows at the enemy, as European arms were not to be encountered by such weapons. This shewed the necessity of procuring a force suitable to the enemy it would have to contend with. That enemy employed compulsion for the most tyrannical purposes, and should we not resort to it to insure our preservation? The people, he was confident, would submit with alacrity to whatever should be necessary for that purpose. He could not believe that the militia officers, so brave, patriotic, and high-minded class of men, would feel any reluctance to consent to this measure, seeing and knowing as they must do, that our fate depended, not upon what we might do six months hence, but what we shall do present. Every feeling of public duty and private honour, a proper regard for our religion and property, as well as for every thing that can be valuable in civil or social life, must bind them to promote the measure. We should not blind ourselves to our situation. If the enemy should conquer this country, he would rob us of every thing we hold dear. He would realize what he told his army at Ulm, that he had 500 years of vengeance to inflict on
<image src="S1V0009P0I0490"/>
<col>935</col>
England. What he said then, he would no doubt realize, if he should succeed in his designs against this country. That enemy had never broken his word in any thing cruel, vengeful, or invasive. The long arrear of hate for the 500 years that Great Britain had rivalled and resisted the power of France, would be discharged with accumulated interest. If this were true, he was sure that militia officers would not feel either disgust or relaxation in consequence of a measure which was necessary to preserve the country from the dangers that threatened it. He was sure that there would be no objection to the measure, when it would be seen that it was become necessary. In the case of an individual who might not be willing to go from his family though balloted, a fund might be provided by private benevolence to cover him from the severity. He only threw out these hints, that means might be devised to obviate any cases of individual hardship that might occur; though he was afraid that the practical consequence of acting upon such a principle, might be injurious in another way, by interfering with the regular recruiting for the army.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Calcraft</member> <membercontribution>could not concur in the sentiments expressed by the hon. gentlemen, who had for the first time addressed the house that night, (Messrs. Willoughby and Lockhart) though he was anxious to concur in any measure that might be deemed necessary for the security of the country, in the critical situation in which it was placed. Before he could agree to the proposition of the noble lord, he must first look at the situation of our national force; at the pretext for the noble lord's plan, and at the plan itself. When he found that the force already on foot was, if properly organized, arranged and regulated, sufficient to save the country, he was anxious to spare his countrymen that compulsion, which the noble lord considered necessary. If he was persuaded that the existing force was sufficient for that purpose, he was justified in opposing the noble lord's measure. Before he proceeded in his argument, he should beg leave to make one or two observations upon the volunteer force. He was fully sensible of he zeal, the spirita<ob/> due sense of the country's danger, with which the volunteers had come forward in its defence, but he could not sit silent and hear charges brought against his right hon. friends of the late administration, that they had by their measures diminished the vo-
<col>936</col>
lunteers. If gentlemen were but to examine the papers on the table, they would find that any diminution which the volunteer force might have undergone had not arisen out of the measures or regulations of the gentlemen with whom he acted, but was the natural consequence of the institution [a cry of no, no]. He begged gentlemen to examine the papers. In the year 1805, the volunteer force was upwards of 400,000; but, at the commencement of the year 1806, that force was reduced to 318,000; and this was before his hon. friends had come into office, before any regulations which they afterwards made existed, and therefore the charges so constantly urged against his hon. friends was not borne out by the documents. Every body must be aware that it was the nature of such an institution to be fluctuating, and it was evident from the documents on the table, that from the time when his hon. friends came into office to the latest return, the reduction of the volunteer force did not exceed 28,000. Any gentleman who looked to the fact, and compared that diminution with what had taken place in the antecedent year, m<ob/>st be sensible that there was no foundation whatever for the charge. As to the inspecting field-officers, both he and his hon. friends admitted, that it was necessary that there should be some organ between the volunteers and the government. But there was a complete staff in every district, who were nearly idle, and who, by performing this duty, might cause a considerable saving to the nation. It might be said, that the saving would be small: he contended, however, that the effect on the country, by attending to every necessary principle of economy, would be considerable. He asked too, why those inspecting officers had not been taken from the half-pay, rather than from amongst those that had quitted the service? It was somewhat remarkable, that of the 70 inspecting field-officers, only 16 were in the army. Did not that look like a desire to extend patronage? It certainly wore to him the strongest appearance of that which had so lately been the topic of mutual charge and recrimination in that house. As to the plan of the noble lord, which was to operate by filling up the places of the men who should volunteer from the militia by the ballot, what was that but a conscription to supply the army? If such a measure was necessary, it would he much better to employ the ballot to procure men for a more
<image src="S1V0009P0I0491"/>
<col>937</col>
enlarged sphere of service, as in the case of the army of reserve. This he should prefer to raising the men for the militia, and waiting till they should become desirous of a more enlarged sphere of service, while the disposable force of the country was, in the mean time, squandered and dispersed. But what was to become of the militia during the process? It would be June next before the men raised for the ballot would be fully trained and effective, as the militia regiments are at present, so that the noble lord's measure would, without any adequate necessity or object, paralyse that important arm of the public force. To shew that there was no necessity for this, it would be sufficient to take a view of the force now existing applicable to defence. There were in Great Britain and Ireland at present, of regular troops, 183,000: militia, 77,000; naval troops, seamen, and marines, which, by being employed round the coasts, were applicable to defensive purposes, 120,000; artillery, 20,000; amounting together to more than 400,000 men. There were, besides, 300,000 volunteers in Great Britain, which, with the sea fencibles, and the volunteers of Ireland, made an aggregate amounting to nearly one million of men in arms for the defence of the country, and afforded by our limited population. With such a force as that in arms, could they not provide for the security of the country without harassing the subject with a conscription or ballot? If they did not conceive that force sufficient, they were more apprehensive of the power of the French arms than he was disposed to be. The plan of the noble lord would, no doubt, procure a valuable supply for the army, but the militia was to be filled up by a ballot that would fall heavily upon a particular class, and the ballot always resolved itself into a bounty, so that it would thus become a heavy and oppressive tax upon a class least able to bear it. It was not just to procure the supply for the army from any particular class. For his part, he should much rather have the men raised by bounty from a public fund. When the volunteering from the militia had formerly been resorted to, it rested on totally different grounds. The noble lord had stated, as a ground for the measure, that the regular force of the country had been scattered and dispersed by the predecessors of the present administration. But that noble lord had not stated, that the present ministers were sending more troops in one ex-
<col>938</col>
pedition, at least in the two armaments they had been preparing, than all their predecessors had sent out. They certainly had collected more men and transports for their expedition, for which it was less difficult to find any thing than an object, or an officer to command. When the volunteering from the militia had taken place in 1799, there was a considerable foreign expedition in progress. Again, in the year 1805, there was some plausible pretext for the measure, though he had felt it his duty to oppose it at the time. The noble lord had stated, that it was not his intention to take any measure that would affect the militia, bu<ob/> was it not galling to officers who had exerted themselves in making their men good soldiers, to have so constitutional a force for defence frittered away, at the moment when there was a probability of its being brought into action? It would be to mock them, to give them the name of militia, if they were to be converted into a supplying source to the army. If ever the day was to arrive, when British blood was to be shed upon British ground, it would be degrading and disgraceful to militia officers to be deprived of the opportunity of shewing their bravery and their skill in the defence of their country. The noble lord had also declared, that it was not his intention to alter or interfere with the system of his right hon. friend: but it was his intention to subvert it. The ballot would interfere with the regular recruiting, and a falling off in that would afford ground of charge against the system. The hon. gentlemen opposite viewed with an envious and malignant eye the immortal credit belonging to the system established by his right hon. friend. Had not that system procured more men than the additional force act and the ordinary recruiting in the same time? It had; and that was doing a great deal. He remembered the high bounties and the complicated and vexatious machinery of that bill: he remembered the ages and description of men obtained by it, and if the returns were to be analyzed, he believed that it would appear that no such numbers as appeared in the returns had been actually supplied to the army. The scheme of the noble lord was a covered attack by sap upon the system of his right hon. friend.&#x2014;Having said thus much in opposition to the bill, he should add, that he was not as great an enemy as others to the ballot, as a mode of recruiting for the army, but it was only to be justified by a strong and imperious
<image src="S1V0009P0I0492"/>
<col>939</col>
necessity. The defensive force marked out by the constitution should not be frittered away: and if any considerable addition were necessary to the disposable force of the country, the ballot ought rather to be applied to that purpose, than in the manner proposed in this bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cripps </member>, <membercontribution>so far as his observation had extended, though he allowed that was rather a limited criterion, had found that desertion had not decreased in consequence of the late measures of military arrangement. He thought some extraordinary exertion in the way of recruiting was required in the present crisis. With respect to any general diminution in the attendance of volunteer corps, he was not competent to speak; but in the corps that he commanded, consisting of 400 men, there had been no falling off. He thought it a great defect in the arrangement of the late plan, with respect to the militia, that the ballot was altogether stopped, and that the vacancies occasioned by the retreat of those who had served their terms, were not filled up. He was of opinion, that the inspecting field-officers, though in some instances of use, need not be so numerous as they now were.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Wood</member> <membercontribution>said, it must be allowed, that the present crisis called for every possible exertion, in order to have not only ample means of defence at home, but also of powerful attack, if opportunity should offer. He agreed that our existing armed force was, in comparison with our population, beyond that of any other country. But when the despotic power of the present ruler of France had been unable to find recruits without resorting to conscription, he did not see why we should abstain from resorting to a measure of equal force for the defence of the freedom and happiness we enjoyed. The recruiting under the new system had been hitherto so successful, because it had no competition to struggle with; the militia ballot was totally suspended. In May it would revive, and when the five or six thousand men, who were then to retire, should come to be balloted for, the effect of the plan would be much less than it had been. It was not on measures of mere prospective success that the safety of the country could be allowed to rest. He trusted that the colonels of the militia regiments would universally promote the execution of this measure when it should be passed: for however it might be in general matter of commendable emulation in them, to vie with each other who should
<col>940</col>
have the best regiment, that emulation must give way to the superior importance of the preservation of the country. It should be matter of pride to encourage the men to go into the line, and the colonels, who in such an exigency, would rather repress than encourage the general ardour, could look with little confidence to their men, and could be looked upon with little confidence by those men, if it should be necessary for them to go into action together on British ground. He did not think the Training act could be carried into effect in its present form. The line could not spare officers for the mass, neither could the militia. The volunteers he considered well officered in their own kind. If the continent should make a general peace on the terms dictated by Bonaparte, we should have to maintain the contest single-handed. In that case all our force should be called into action, and with a view to strengthen that force he voted for the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bastard</member> <membercontribution>knew of no contest between the militia colonels and the line, but who should have the best discipline; and, if occasion should arise, the best fighting battalions. The object of this bill was to depress the militia, and to raise the glory of the line upon its ruins. He should therefore oppose the bill, looking upon the militia as those most interested in the preservation of the land, consequently those most likely to fight for it, and best entitled to its favour and confidence. With respect to the consistency which gentlemen were called upon to shew, he had never known any consistency during the 15 years that he had sat in parliament, except in uniformly substituting one plan for another, according as every new government wished to supersede the plans of its predecessors. He therefore hoped gentlemen would be now consistent, and that they would persevere in rejecting a measure so much to be deprecated. He hoped that parliament would consider the necessity of making other exertions also, without which it would be impossible to go on in this contest. The weight of taxes, already so intolerable, could not be well increased. He hoped that every acre that was productive, would be taxed without exemption. He thought also, that means might be found in the country, of providing a supply of timber for the navy, now purchased so dearly from foreign nations. He trusted that a committee would be appointed to enquire, and
<image src="S1V0009P0I0493"/>
<col>941</col>
to report, not only what savings could be made in our expenditure, but also what further funds and resources could be called into action. Though he thought these repeated drafts from the militia so many death-blows, and though he was most anxious for adhering to its original constitution, yet if the bill should pass, he should do his duty by giving it his utmost support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>differed from the hon. gent. who had last spoken. He considered that the practice which prevailed of late years, of making the militia nearly the same as regular regiments, hurt considerably the recruiting for the regular army, by causing a competition. When the militia was on the original plan, raised for only 3 years, and serving principally in their own counties, then the balloted men often served, and acquired military habits, which induced them afterwards to enter into the regular army; but when that old practice was changed, and they were marched out of their counties, and kept on the footing of regular regiments, then the men who were balloted no longer served, but obtained substitutes, at large bounties, which injured materially the regular army, by the competition which it gave rise to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Binning</member> <membercontribution>maintained the propriety of our having different descriptions of troops, particularly with a view to home defence. But as the power of making effective attack was among the most powerful means of defence, and as our regular army was the only offensive force that we had in addition to our navy, he thought an increase of the line most necessary in this momentous crisis. The noble lord took a comparative view of the effects of the measures of the right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham) for recruiting the army, and the Additional Force Act, and contended that this latter would have been equally productive if allowed a fair trial. Considering the state of Europe, and of the British empire, menaced with all the rage of the conqueror; the state of Ireland too, for though he counted much upon the loyalty of the Catholics of Ireland, and was convinced that they would repel with indignation the seducing appeals of the bishop of Quimper, yet he could not help thinking that Ireland was vulnerable, acid therefore to be watched with peculiar care, and guarded with an ample for<ob/>e:&#x2014;under all these circumstances the exigency was obvious, and this was the best means of providing for it.</membercontribution></p>
<col>942</col>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>began by saying that he was anxious to express his sentiments of the bill before it went into a committee, because he had not yet heard that made out which ought to have been proved in the first instance, namely the necessity of the case. He had heard nothing to convince him that such emergency as had been stated existed at present, and until he was convinced of that, he could not assent to the bill in its outset. And here he could not help making one observation, that in the whole course of those wars so protracted, when that house was so often and so solemnly told by Mr. Pitt, that not an hour was to be lost, that the wisdom of the country must at once and for ever resolve upon the best means of bringing forth its strength, and that after all those warnings, and consultations, and measures proposed, agreed to, and acted upon, that still we were now as we were at first; that from the year 1793 to 1807, nothing had yet been effectually done in the way of determining upon some satisfactory mode of national defence. This was extraordinary, but it was not unaccountable, for upon a review of all those different plans and schemes, it did appear that they were calculated to act only on great emergencies. They were provided against incidental events, and therefore were not of that permanent nature necessary to the progressive improvement of a wise and comprehensive system of military defence; therefore it was, that the plans of that statesman, as to the defence of the country, were not found to answer. The Additional Force Act, considered as a measure of security, entirely failed. And, now, what were they about to do? merely to provide, as it was said, against an emergency. But then, the present could not be said to be one of Mr. Pitt's emergencies. The French emperor was not now at Boulogne. Things were not yet brought to the mere cast of the die. The fate of the empire was not yet brought to the issue of a single battle; the country was not called on by any existing circumstances, to play the bad game of sacrificing the future to the present. As to the French emperor, he would here take leave to observe upon the idle and childish way in which many persons were pleased to indulge when speaking of that person; words did not win battles. It was by deeds, and deeds of energy, we were to maintain ourselves and oppose him; but what was the deed of energy that the country was now called upon to perform, and who were
<image src="S1V0009P0I0494"/>
<col>943</col>
those who now called upon the country, who now told the country that a moment was not to be lost? The men who, in the midst of all that emergency, put an abrupt stop to every possible means of answering that emergency, by dissolving the parliament, so far admitting the necessity of extraordinary levies; but he denied that necessity. He was now, as formerly, fully satisfied that there was, in the existing forces, ample means of defence, provided that force was well administered. He would put it fairly to any military man, if 168,000 men were not a sufficient establishment for the national defence, even in cases of the last emergency?&#x2014;The noble lord had said much upon the necessity of ministers having at their command a large disposable force. He could not at all agree with the noble lord as to that necessity. He was at the same time fully aware that there were many of his majesty's present ministers, who thought the enemy assailable in certain points, and that the means of this country could not be better applied than in expeditions to those places. But he was not of that opinion. A good deal had been said, too, about the necessity of having a sufficient disposable force to send to Ireland; and yet he knew not how to reconcile that with the measures that were now pursuing with respect to the defence of that part of the united kingdom. For, if report was true, ministers were at that time withdrawing from Ireland the forces which it had been pretended, in introducing that bill, it was necessary to keep there. Why were ministers in so violent a hurry to pass the Irish insurrection act, if that country was so tranquil that they could draw off the greater portion of its military strength without any apprehension whatever? This looked like tampering with Ireland. They were told that there was the most urgent necessity for dispatch in passing the insurrection bill into a law, for that the other would expire on the 1st of August. Why, what was intended to be conveyed by this affectation of alarm? Were they to be told at the same time, that Ireland would be lost if it was a day without an insurrection act, and yet hear of the troops being withdrawn from it, while the necessity of sending troops into Ireland had been pleaded as an additional argument in favour of the noble lord's bill? Or why, if such danger was apprehended with respect to Ireland, by the delay of passing the insurrection bill, why dissolve the parliament and thereby
<col>944</col>
increase the danger so much apprehended? But, as to the emergency so much talked of, he did not look upon it as so pressing. The French emperor would take some time to pass from the present scene of his conquests to Paris; he would take some time in preparing to direct his immediate operations against this country, and some considerable time must, in the nature of things, elapse between the commencement of those operations and the final attempt to bring them to an issue. The first period could not possibly be before the autumn; the next would extend at least till winter; and the final attempt would not be before at least a year had passed by: twelve months must first elapse, and at the end of that period, in what state would they find the force of the country? just at that moment the effects of the noble lord's bill would have operated, so far as to have, by that time, disorganized the defensible force, and the ballot, at that time, would not have been completed. Let the house, then, mark the injustice of the bill as affecting the militia. The militia might at that moment, be brought into action, when the country would inconsiderately, but very naturally, entertain precisely the same sentiments of its character and promise that it now so jutly did; and what must be the result might be easily foreseen by any man who knew how ill calculated a set of raw recruits must be to supply the place of an experienced and disciplined soldiery. He had seen the first draught that had been made from a militia regiment in Kent, and an hon. gent. over against him had been present at the same time: he confidently appealed to that hon. gent., if he ever witnessed such a shameless exhibition of drunkenness, idleness and dissoluteness, as upon that occasion. The defective situation in which these men were found on the subsequent expedition to Holland, was too well known to require any comment from him. He had been further assured by a general officer, who was very capable of forming a correct judgment on the fact, that after their return from that unfortunate service, it would take nine months to make these men fit for any other.&#x2014;The evils and hardships of the measure now before the house would be felt most sensibly in recruiting the militia after the draft. The militia was in effect made up of substitutes, and those who now should be balloted and could not serve, must of course find substitutes, whatever price they might cost. The conscription enforced
<image src="S1V0009P0I0495"/>
<col>945</col>
throughout France was spoken of as worthy of being imitated here. If it was, let us come to it manfully, and let us not practise it indirectly, but more partially and oppressively, by beating up the militia, and then allowing it to feed till it filled itself, in order to devour it. He must say he had a better opinion of the army of reserve than of the measure now before the house. But even that measure justified in the execution, the objections he had felt, and made to it, while passing through the house. He had, notwithstanding the disapprobation he had felt and expressed, contributed most zealously and actively in carrying that measure into effect; and he was sure every member would enforce this, or any other measure, with equal zeal, let their private sentiments of it be what they might. He again enforced the folly of having recourse to temporary expedients, to the destruction of lasting resources. The present expedient was a kind of fungus springing up and perishing as soon as it was plucked. The existing force was sufficient for all the exigencies of the time, even though the great door, which was about to have been opened for engaging the Irish Catholics to enlist, appeared to be irrevocably shut, [a cry of no! no!] at least while the right hon. gent. opposite should remain in power. The system which his right hon. friend had introduced to supersede and remedy that system of expedients that had so long and so injuriously prevailed, was founded on fundamental principles of the wisest policy, and on human nature itself. The substitutes serving in the militia, were now entitled to look forward for their discharge at the end of the war. To engage these men for 21 years, would be totally to alter the principle of his right hon. friend's plan, and to destroy the confidence placed in it. The noble lord's present plan, supposing there was an immediate exigency, and that this plan would supply that exigency, would not go one moment beyond it. It would exhaust itself, and destroy the general means of recruiting the army. It was objected to his right hon. friend's plan, that, of those it had procured, a great number were boys. It was urged in answer to this, that the plan it had superseded, had procured a great number of old men, who were counted, though evidently approaching fast to a period when they would be no longer fit for service. The entrance of so many boys was to his mind a proof that the plan of his right hon.
<col>946</col>
friend had made the condition of a soldier agreeable to parents and friends. For boys must be supposed to be under the controul of their parents and friends, and could not be supposed to enter so generally without their approbation. It should besides be considered, that these boys did not begin to count their first period of service, till they reached the age of 18. Their parents parted with them cheerfully, because it was not a parting for life, as it was before, at the very outset. His right hon. friend's plan would, if persevered in, correct all the vices that had hitherto pervaded our military system. He had a high opinion of the volunteers, but he must altogether condemn and deprecate the opinion uttered by some, that this part of our force might be relied on for our whole defence. No man could seriously hold such an opinion, and express it for the purpose of courting popularity, with an intention to withdraw it, in the event of the exigency arising; it was a dangerous as well as an unwise and uncandid expedient. Those who would attempt to expose the fallacy of the idea would be accused of disparaging the volunteers, while it would he endangering the ruin of the country to suffer it to pass unexposed. The volunteer force was at first 415,000 men. It then declined to 350,000, and afterwards to 300,000, without any observation on the decline from the other side. It was now 289,000, and he was convinced as effective at that number as the whole original 400,000. But this last reduction, though the smallest in proportion of time, was unjustly charged as matter of crime upon his right hon. friend, and those who acted with him.&#x2014;He hoped the Training act would be carried into effect in addition to all the other expedients. Without some measure of that general nature it was impossible that our regulars, our militia, our volunteers, or even our navy, could secure us. He recommended the pursuit of all measures that could lead to the restoration of peace. Nothing would tend more to the strength and security of the empire than the true sentiment of cordial union and co-operation through all orders of the people. I have always, said the hon. gent., thought that your best strength would be peace among yourselves; peace with your dependencies, and above all, peace in Ireland&#x2014;peace with the Irish Catholic; and that would do more for you than all your measures for new levies and new conscripts. You talk of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0496"/>
<col>947</col>
strengthening the resources of the empire, while you are hurrying through the house Insurrection acts against the most vital part of the empire. The Irish Catholic is excluded from your militia [a loud cry of no! no! from the ministerial benches]. I do not say that he may not enter into your militia regiments; but I do say that the obstacles you have put in his way amount to a comparative exclusion. I have now but one observation to make, and that is, to express my earnest hope that his majesty's ministers do not think so desperately of our situation, as not to be willing and anxious on all occasions to embrace the first opportunity of accepting any overtures that may offer for peace with the emperor of France. There never was, I believe, in the history of empires, an epoch in which peace was not the most desireable object, in which it was not wise to try for it, and madness wantonly to evade it; in saying thus much; I hope I shall not be understood as wishing to listen to any accommodation that could compromise the dignity of this great empire. The wish next my heart has always been a peace with France; and I have always deprecated the war of words I have heard too often within these walls, directed against an enemy who is not by words to be resisted. Mr. Pitt always prefaced the statements of any new plan of defence or taxation which he had to propose, with inflated accounts of the pride and arrogance, the relentless hatred and jealousy of a cruel and implacable foe;&#x2014;all this being abuse, amounting to nothing more than that Buonaparte was a formidable enemy, and that if you did not kill him, he would kill yon. As yet, however, such predictions have been generally falsified. When Buonaparte came down to his menaced shores, he said that it was the only thing left him to try, and that though the chances were 100 to one against him, he would be obliged to try it. He now will have the means of trial. We, I am confident, shall not be deficient on our part. In such an extremity I shall not fear the issue; but, at the same time, I shall live in hope of what may be more conducive to our happiness&#x2014;an honourable peace between the two nations.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>said, he thought the arguments of the hon. gent. who had just sat down most extraordinary, for he had admitted that the common enemy of this country had conquered the whole of the continent of Europe, and that he was
<col>948</col>
now about to concentrate and direct his whole attention to the attack of this country; and yet he had strennously contended that there was no urgency which called on the house and on ministers to adopt the measure now proposed for the defence of the country. He begged the house would recollect that his majesty's present ministers had been called on by several members of that house to know if they did not mean to bring forward some measure to this effect; and he had been informed just now, for he happened not to be in the house on the day on which it happened, that the hon. gent. who spoke last had been of the number of those who put that question. He, for one of those ministers, would say, that such a measure had been under their serious consideration from the first moment they came into office; but they had been desirous not to act with any degree of precipitation; first, because they wished to see what effects might result from the plan of the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Windham), and to convince him and the public that it was not their intention to overturn and do away every thing which had been adopted on this head by their predecessors in office; and, secondly, because they could not possibly foresee the disastrous events which had lately taken place on the continent; and from a hope and expectation that they would not have happened, had flattered themselves the war might have been so much longer protracted, that such a measure would not be so immediately and indispensably necessary as recent unfortunate events had rendered otherwise. It was impossible for his majesty's present ministers to have protracted the late warfare; but, perhaps, if assistance had some months before been afforded, there might have been a chance of that event having been produced; as it was, there remained only a choice of evils; and he believed that the choice now made was that of the least of those which now presented themselves. The ruler of the French had now made peace with all those powers on the continent with which he had been engaged in war, and we had to contend with his whole force, concentrated and directed against this country. In fact, the greatest part of the continent of Europe were against us; and surely the house would not hesitate to say, that this was such an exigency as called for a very considerable augmentation of our force? As that was granted, the next question was, whether it was not necessary
<image src="S1V0009P0I0497"/>
<col>949</col>
to have part of it a disposeable force? A great mistake seemed to have been made by several gentlemen who had spoken on this head, and who had seemed to consider a disposeable force only in the light of a force to be used in foreign offensive operations. They seemed to forget that we had many possessions abroad which must require troops to defend them. Since the present war broke out, we had gained the Cape, and possessions in South America; a part of our force was detached to Alexandria and other places, which required, and would require, troops for the purpose of keeping them, he would not say in perpetuity, but in order to purchase what the hon. gent. who spoke last had so warmly expressed himself desirous of, an honourable peace. He war one of those who so far concurred in opinion with the hon. gent. that peace was always desirable; but he begged the house to recollect, that in order to obtain that on fair and honourable terms, it would be necessary to shew the enemy that we were prepared, at all points, to carry on the war; and that nothing would ultimately produce that desirable event more successfully, than being able to shew him that we were in a state to cope with him, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe where we had foreign possessions. Those possessions had many of them devolved on his majesty's present ministers, from plans and operations originating with their predecessors in office; though he did not mention this with a view of giving any opinion on the propriety or otherwise of those plans, but merely to shew that the country was at this time so situated, as to require a much larger disposable force than it had a twelvemonth ago. This being the case, which he thought would scarcely be denied, the question was, what was the best mode that could be devised or adopted, of obtaining a large force of that description in a short time? He thought there could be but one opinion, that the measure of his noble friend, now under the consideration of the house, was best adapted to this purpose; for it gave immediately a very large addition to our army, of troops already disciplined, and which would be able to act with the regular army, either at home or abroad for defensive purposes. With respect to what had been said, that it was intended to debase and degrade the character of the militia, he was certain that no such idea had ever entered into the heads of his majesty's present ministers: so far from it, he for
<col>950</col>
one, had always thought with the hon. member behind him (col. Wood), that it was giving the militia an opportunity of defending the country on a more extended scale, and would shew that their officers had not only made them solders to the eye, but to the heart also, and that they were emulous and zealous to defend their country, not only at home, but in every quarter where their services might be deemed necessary. The hon. gent. who spoke last had said that he would not, in arguing this measure, touch upon any other matters which were not immediately connected with it, and he had almost kept his word. He had, however, in some degree, departed from it, in referring to the case of the people of Ireland, which he thought was not immediately connected with this measure, and which was not, in his opinion, very fair and candid, when he knew that the late ministers did not mean to have acted on the plan of any further extension of indulgences or conciliation than merely the bill which had been brought into the house, had they remained in office. He hoped, therefore, the house would see the necessity of as speedily as possible adopting a measure which was, on all hands, allowed to be necessary, and which the present bill was calculated to effect in the easiest and most speedy mode.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Addington</member> <membercontribution>said, that if the question now to be considered was an ordinary one, and if he did not concur with a gent. who had spoken last but one (Mr. Whitbread) in thinking that the decision of the house might prove of vital importance, and that perhaps even the preservation of our independence might depend on the measures now to be adopted, he should not have obtruded himself on the notice of the house; but in this crisis of unexampled difficulty and contingent dangers, which most seemed to admit, though differing materially as to the means of averting them, he hoped it would not be thought unbecoming in him to submit to the consideration of the house such observations as the most mature reflection had suggested to him.&#x2014;In one point, and indeed in more than one, he cordially concurred with his right hon. friend opposite to him, (Mr. Yorke,) that one false step taken at this time, might prove irretrievable; that the interval between the present moment and the next meeting of parliament might be big with events, in which the national welfare might be deeply involved; and that the utmost
<image src="S1V0009P0I0498"/>
<col>951</col>
caution and circumspection were necessary in deciding on such measures as might be now submitted to parliament. It had been therefore matter of great satisfaction to him to find, that ministers had, however reluctantly, acceded to the proposition made from this side of the house, to defer the second reading of this bill till that day. The interval thus given, he, in common with every other member, had turned to the best account he could, by weighing all the arguments for or against this measure; and he had even indulged the delusive hope that his noble friend opposite to him, (lord Castlereagh,) would have reconsidered his own proposition, and would have come down to the house prepared to substitute in its room, one as simple, and infinitely more efficient; one better adapted to the circumstances in which the country was placed; one equally practicable, and more certain in its results; and free from the weighty and insuperable objections that attached to the measure now under discussion. To his mind, this would have been an inexpressible relief, proportioned to the reluctance that he felt in appearing to oppose government on such a subject, and at such a moment, when he knew the value of unanimity in that house; to which unanimity he for one could not contribute but at the expence of every feeling, of every conscientious opinion, of every sentiment of public duty, and indeed without compromising the safety of the empire itself.&#x2014;It would soon appear that his disapprobation of this measure rested on grounds not only different from, but absolutely opposite to, those which had been stated by his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) on the bench above him. Hitherto he had always appeared particularly alive, almost to an extreme, to the dangers to be apprehended from the formidable power of France; and had, on former occasions been the foremost in recommending the adoption of new exertions, to meet new emergencies. And yet now he could contemplate those dangers, magnified to a degree that might disquiet the stoutest heart; he could look with a steady eye on those dangers, increased out of all proportion to those of any former period, and could gravely recommend to parliament and to the country, to be content to do nothing&#x2014;to rest with their arms before them&#x2014;and to depend exclusively for our security on the operation of those measures, which he, when a minister, had
<col>952</col>
prevailed on parliament to adopt. Of the efficacy, the value, the wisdom of that great measure, the new military system, Mr. A. said, that his right hon. friend would never expect to hear any doubt expressed by him: he ever should think, in full confidence of its successful result, that by it he had built an eternal monument of fame for himself, and had laid the foundation of the future security of the country. He had been one of those who had expressed themselves most sanguine as to its immediate good effects, and still thought, that if proper measures had been taken at an earlier period for the promulgation of the new regulations, as to this moment they had not, its success would have been apparent much sooner, and to a much greater extent. But what had the right hon. projector of it always said on this subject? Why, that it would take not only months, but years, to bring it to any thing like perfection.&#x2014;If, therefore, his right hon. friend at all agreed with him as to the magnitude, or the proximity of the danger with which we are threatened, his own recorded opinions of the tardy progress of his own plans, afforded a complete answer to the objections which he now made to the adoption of some auxiliary measures, which would, at least, afford a temporary resource till his own might answer all the purposes for which it was designed. That ballot, in every shape, must more or less effect its operation, he did not mean to deny. This could only be temporary; every one would know the cause of it; and he was warranted in believing that it would be inconsiderable. Because, during the operation of that great and most efficient measure (as he believed he now might be allowed to call it), the Army of Reserve bill, it was a fact that the regular recruiting had not diminished more than one fourteenth, as was demonstrated by documents laid on the table of that house. There was good reason therefore to hope, that the effect upon it would be trifling.&#x2014;It would be already evident to his noble friend, that he entirely concurred with ministers as to the indispensable necessity of adopting new and vigorous measures, which the state of affairs, and the feelings of the country demanded at their hands.&#x2014;He applauded government for its wisdom in persisting in the military system, which they had found shaped to their hands, whatever were their declared opinion of it, and in avoiding the danger of unhinging our whole military
<image src="S1V0009P0I0499"/>
<col>953</col>
establishment by attempting to rescind it. They had done more; they were not only giving it fair play, but, as he knew, had lately taken some very active steps to give it an accelerated impulse. How far these. were the most judicious that could have been selected for that purpose, he should not stop now to enquire; he was sure they were well meant, and was confident that they would prove considerably efficient.&#x2014;He would now come nearer to the question under the immediate consideration of the house: which was a proposition of the noble lord's to raise 38,000 men, of which 28,000 were to be disposeable force. It might he convenient to the house to look at this principally in three points of view. First, whether its disadvantages might not be greater than any advantages that were likely to accrue from it? Secondly, whether any advantages at all were to be expected from it, or if any, to what extent? And thirdly, whether other measures infinitely preferable might not be resorted to, for the attainment of the object in view, winch he had already admitted to be a most important one? On each of these points, he hoped that the house would indulge him with making observations; assuring gentlemen, that as he was not in the habit, so he never felt disposed to trespass longer on their patience, than was absolutely necessary to his view of any subject, and that he should abstain, as far as possible, from renewing those arguments which had already been more ably urged, on a previous discussion of this subject.&#x2014;He would begin with stating, that we had now, according to the last returns, a militia, English, Scots, and Irish, amounting to 77,000 men; as fine a body of men as the world could exhibit, and as efficient as any that had not actually been engaged in regular service. It would be recollected, that this force did not consist of new levies, of raw recruits, but had now been embodied above four years; and that therefore, what was of immense importance, a mutual confidence might be supposed to exist between officers and men. They constituted a formidable part of our domestic strength, amounting in fact to very little short of one half of it. This force his noble friend proposed to unsettle (to use his own expression) for a time, by allowing the large proportion of 28,000 men to volunteer from it it into the line. Was this sort of gentle concussion all the inconvenience that promised to result from such an attempt?
<col>954</col>
Was it possible to look back on the mischievous consequences that had ever resulted from those tamperings with our constitutional force, and not tremble at the renewal of them? Without detaining the house by going back to what had occurred in the war before last, he would only avert to what had passed since the present militia was raised in 1803. One argument in favour of raising it to such an amount, and one which he hoped would not be hastily lost sight of was, that whilst the necessities of the state were obliging us to increase our regular army to such an extent, it might be prudent that our constitutional force should bear a proper proportion to it. A militia therefore of 90,000 men was raised; and such was the confidence and spirit prevailing at that time, that in a few months it was completely officered, and in less than a year in the highest state of discipline. Scarcely however had this fine fabric attained this degree of perfection, than it began to totter. In 1804, a change of government took place, and the first measure of the new administration was, the Additional Force bill, one great principle of which was to suffer this force to decay, in numbers equal to the supplementary militia. What was the consequence? In the course of one year, the numbers of course fell off from the casualties not having been filled up, and a vast number of officers sent in their resignations, partly from disgust, partly from finding that their services were in a short time not likely to be wanted. And it is curious to remark, that this injurious result of the first measure, namely, a defalcation of five hundred officers, was made a principal argument in the subsequent year, for allowing 17,000 militia to volunteer into the line. For this he had voted, as it was evident that the men could be of no use where they were without officers to command them. With this experience before our eyes, we are now called upon to resort again to this violation of faith towards the militia, and not only to supply the numbers so volunteering, but to add 10,000 to their numbers. We began at the wrong end; instead of thus extinguishing all inducements for gentlemen to come forward, we should begin by endeavouring to revive confidence. We knocked down with one hand, and then raised with the other; but he feared that the blow would be so stunning as to afford no hope of placing this establishment on its legs again. And suppose the highly pro-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0500"/>
<col>955</col>
bable case, of a great resignation of officers, and of the militia furnishing but few volunteers, while you are adding 38,000 men to their numbers. They would be totally useless, and must either be disbanded again, or these new levies must be allowed by a new act to volunteer also into the line. The measure was full of absurdities, as well as of risk.&#x2014;The disadvantages were likely to be such as no possible advantage could compensate; and we should endanger the ruin and annihilation of this branch of service, when we were most likely to stand in need of it. The other dangers of such an experiment had been before fully stated by his right hon. relation near him (Mr. Bathurst). These were, the shock that would be given to the militia, if the measure was successful, from which it would take a long time to recover; its total inefficiency for many months, by reason of the diminution of the strength of the companies; to which he would also add, that the whole of what remained would be rendered useless for near a twelvemonth to come, by the necessity of employing all the non-commissioned officers to drill the recruits as they came in from the different counties.&#x2014;He proceeded to the next consideration, of no less importance. Were any advantages at all likely to accrue from it, or to any extent? His right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) had called it a mere commutation of service, but he could not travel so fast with him as to admit its claim even to that degree of recommendation. Out of doors, it had been called "Robbing Peter to pay Paul." Nor was that accurate, because it was evident that unless Peter consented to be robbed, Paul could not possibly be paid.&#x2014;This, then, he would take as his thesis; and he could not but admire the confidence with which his noble friend anticipated the success of this plan. He was sure that past practice did not warrant this confidence, as he would shew that recent experience did warrant his doubts. Look only at the results of the act of 1805, by which the then minister proposed to procure from the militia seventeen thousand volunteers. Did he procure that number? All turned upon the an<ob/>wer to that question. No; he did not: he got about fifteen thousand. Why, then he entreated the house to consider what we were about to do. From the same body, not merely the same description of force, but from an aggregate of the same identical individuals, we were now to be confident of obtaining 28,000 volunteers, every man of
<col>956</col>
whom refused to stir on the former occasion. In 1807, 28,000 individuals were to shew great alacrity to do that, which in 1805, to a man they refused to do. This was extravagant: the act of parliament, though it gave the power, could not create the will. He was aware that it might be said that the former act imposed restrictions and regulations, which were not to he granted under the present one. To which he should answer, that those restrictions were introduced to silence the complaints of a large proportion of the most respectable of the militia officers. If, therefore, they were withheld now, though you may get a few men, the other evil would be aggravated, namely, the danger of driving such officers out of your service.&#x2014;He was far from meaning, or wishing to overstate these points. They were not random opinions, but reasons given for them. These his noble friend might controvert, if he had the means of doing so&#x2014;he believed he could not. The house had heard the opinions of two or three respectable militia officers within these walls; out of doors he had met with but one opinion amongst them. They were placed in a most awkward and invidious situation, and might naturally feel some reluctance in avowing their objections, and in deprecating the adoption of the measure, when they were told, not as heretofore, that their men were wanted for foreign offensive operation, but that the safety of the empire required the sacrifice.&#x2014;This was indeed, for obvious reasons, a cruel mortification to them. There could be no possible doubt of what their view of this project must be; of a project, which, in his contemplation of it, amounted exactly to this: that we were called upon to take this sorry and sickly expedient, this exhausted, worn out, threadbare remnant of a system, faulty and vicious in itself, as the substantive foundation of a measure by which we were to be enabled to maintain our national independence. If we were really reduced so low, which he utterly denied, it was time to abandon all hopes of a successful issue to the great contest in which we are engaged&#x2014;"Oremus pacem, et dextras tendamus inermes."&#x2014;Let it not be supposed that such was his view of our situation, feeling confident that, if our strength was wisely called forth and applied, we might, under Providence, treat the threats of our implacable adversary with defiance.&#x2014;On the third point, he should not detain the house at any length, as it had been fully and ably expatiated upon by his hon. relation on a
<image src="S1V0009P0I0501"/>
<col>957</col>
former occasion. In fact we had now three distinct plans before the house; for the negative proposition of the late secretary of state could hardly be entitled to that denomination. The noble lord proposes to allow 28,000 militia to volunteer into the line, and then to resort to ballot to raise 38,000 new militia. His right hon. friend opposite to him, (Mr. Yorke,) approves of the first part of this plan, but suggests that the ballot should be resorted to, to create an army of reserve. His right hon. relation objects to the volunteering altogether, and recommends that the revival of he army of reserve should be resorted to in the first instance, and suggests other auxiliary measures for adding effectually and expeditiously to your military force. In every part of this last proposition he most cordially concurred. In one point all three agreed, namely, on the necessity of resorting to ballot in one way or other. His noble friend had on all occasions done ample justice to the unexampled efficiency of the Army of Reserve bill, which was natural, he having been an assistant adviser of it, and its able advocate in that house.&#x2014;But it seemed to be now out of favour with the noble lord. And yet he need not be reminded, that in one month it had raised 15,000 men; in two, 25,000; and in about four months, very little short of 40,000 men; he knew the causes that had obstructed its complete success, namely, the previous ballot for 90,000 militia, and the calling forth 400,000 volunteers who were entitled to exemption from it. He would recollect that it was only suspended by the administration that created it, and that it was their fixed intention to resort to it again, in case of any new emergency, after a sufficient respite from ballot. The machinery was all ready; the force to be raised by it would be preferable, inasmuch as it was more disposeable; and it would be free from the objection of even unsettling the militia, but what he should call the danger of annihilating it. As to the emergency, it now presented itself. This measure had been called an expedient; he would maintain that it was a principle; not indeed constantly, but occasionally operative, and when called into action, certain of success. This it was now proposed to revive to a certain extent. In addition to it, to raise 12 or 15 battalions by giving one step in rank. It would be recollected that the government that was dissolved in 1804, had proposed to raise 20
<col>958</col>
battalions in this way, which was overruled. But one-fifth of this rejected plan had been adopted, and actually raised as many men in three months as the whole Additional Force bill had done in one year and three quarters. These two measures, hen, might raise from 40 to 50 thousand men. Both had been tried, and both had been found successful.&#x2014;There were two other points, namely, the Volunteer Service and the Training bill, on which he would wish to touch, were he not fearful of abusing the indulgence of the house. With regard to the latter, he had never discovered the necessity of its superseding the Levy en Masse bill, on which one step had been taken, viz. the enrollment, and laid on the table of the house. The principle of both was admirable, namely, that of making our whole effective population military, by rotation. It was almost a sheet-anchor of our safety, as it afforded inexhaustible means of supplying our army in case of invasion.&#x2014;He had looked at it lately in the capacity of a deputy lieutenant, and believed that without some alteration, it would be found impracticable. As to the volunteers, he rejoiced that they were to be restored to their old establishment. On the re-appointment of inspecting field-officers, there was much difference of opinion, even amongst those most favourable to the system. He approved of it; his own observation fully justified the opinion that he entertained of their value. He had seen none that had not honourably executed the duty intrusted to them. But there were abuses both in this establishment and in permanent duty, which he severely condemned, namely, the field-officers ordering the six inspections, during the summer months, and corps going on permanent duty, from one city to another, not ten miles distant&#x2014;they should go at least thirty miles&#x2014;should be assembled in brigade, under the commanding officer of the district, and at a reduced expence, and should be all directed to learn the light-infantry exercise.&#x2014;With these impressions and convictions even his noble friend would allow, if he believed him sincere, that it was impossible for him to support this measure, indeed impossible for him to abstain from resisting it. Other gentlemen who felt equal reluctance with himself in opposing any measure of government at such a moment, would agree with him, that this was not a time to be complimenting away the safety of the country. Had only a little been
<image src="S1V0009P0I0502"/>
<col>959</col>
proposed to be done, without a concomitant greater evil, it should have had his support, at the same time that he would have urged his majesty's ministers to greater exertions. But this was doing worse than nothing. At an early period of the present war, it was matter of complaint (not universally admitted to be a most unfounded one), that the government of that day, which was unceasingly employed in calling forth all the energies of the country, that they had not done enough, and when the danger was comparatively trifling. He had not forgot an unanswered statement by his noble friend opposite to him, made six months before the dissolution of that government, that we had at that time 700,000 men in arms, and in the eighth month of the war. Had we that number now? Had we any thing like it?&#x2014;we ought, therefore not only to make up that deficiency but to go infinitely beyond it. And yet, says a right hon. gent. "do nothing." His answer should be, "leave nothing undone."&#x2014;"Think nothing gained, till nought remains," nor consider the country safe, till all her means are brought into action. Did gentlemen recollect what was the enemy with which we had to contend? unfortunately we had but one, and that almost the whole of Europe, under subjection to, or under the controul of our formidable and irreconcileable adversary. Since the period to which he had been adverting, we had seen that mighty conqueror, for so he must call him, advancing with rapid strides to universal dominion; in successive year marching straight forward to his object whatever it might be, looking neither to the right or the left, unchecked by difficulties, unappalled by dangers, always proportioning his means to his views, and, though bravely opposed, always successful and triumphant; in the midst of his conquests ever looking to England as the ultimate object of his ambitious views, and making his conquests on the continent the instruments and the means of accomplishing our ruin. In 1804, Holland was only the ally; she might now be considered as an integral part of France. Spain was then neutral, now her naval force was thrown into the scale; happily, indeed, immensely crippled by our splendid naval achievements. We might have other enemies&#x2014;we might have them in a quarter to which at present he dared only advert.&#x2014;To look at this approaching storm without anxiety, would be worse than madness&#x2014;without hope, if
<col>960</col>
proper efforts were made to meet it, would be worse than folly. Of the latter, however, he for one should feel but little indeed, if he saw good reason to believe that our rulers were inadequately impressed with the former. How far the measure now proposed was calculated to authorize that persuasion, it would be for the house and the country to determine. With the anxious forebodings that pressed on his mind, in case the house and parliament should adopt this proposition, he had no option left him but to resist it, with a view to the adoption of others more vigorous and less objectionable, to which he could give his conscientious support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member> <membercontribution>was glad that his right hon. friend who spoke last had been heard before him, though he was anxious to have addressed the house at the time he rose, in order to repel a charge brought by the right hon. gent. opposite, against the late ministers. He had said that they had abandoned the intention of doing any thing in favour of Ireland. They certainly had done no such thing, but had with anxiety reserved to themselves a power to make representations on this subject. What the right hon. gent. said was contradicted, even by the garbled documents which had been surreptitiously published. With regard to the present measure, he was anxious to support any thing which could have the effect of a permanent addition to our force. The consideration then was, whether this was a measure calculated for that purpose. His hon. friend (Mr. Whitbread) had enteredupon the consideration of the amount of our force compared with our population, and had certainly taken the just view of the subject. He had included in his calculation some who were not properly part of our military force. But, however, without these, our force, compared with our population, was as great, if not greater, than that of any other country. We had about 400,000 men in our army, and having besides 30,000 foreigners; we had 150,000 in the regular army, 20,000 artillery-men, between 70, and 80,000 militia, and 130,000 in the navy. These, with from 370 to 380,000 volunteers, formed nearly 2&#x2013;17ths of our population capable of bearing arms. In one of the most military monarchies of Europe, where there was little commerce and few manufactures, he meant Prussia, the proportion of those actually armed, out of those capable of bearing arms, had been 2&#x2013;17ths. For any permanent force, more
<image src="S1V0009P0I0503"/>
<col>961</col>
than this, could not be found. This was a most essential view of the subject, for if there was a moment when we ought to be peculiarly cautious with respect to military measures, it was when we had already advanced to the natural limits by which we ought to be bounded in ordinary cases. On that ground the present measure was to be considered.&#x2014;The danger he considered as arising from two sources; first, the general danger from the state of the continent; and secondly, the particular danger of invasion arising out of it. This view of the danger would furnish us with principles to try the propriety of the measure. Now, we ought to be cautious about altering the existing force; and certainly when a plan, confessedly of a temporary nature, was brought forward, it ought only to have a temporary effect on former establishments. Now, in these respects, the plan was extremely imperfect, for it went to unsettle the great existing principles of defence.&#x2014;It would have been expected, if any part of our force was to have been destroyed, it would not have been the militia. If there was a time when that service ought to have been improved and encouraged, not annihilated, this was the moment. If it was good for any thing, it was for the defence of the country. At the moment, however, when the attention of ministers ought to be directed to the protection of the country itself, the measure they proposed was one which went to disorganize this very force. This he conceived to be a most extraordinary step, in what could only be a temporary measure of defence. The officers of the militia made many sacrifices for the public advantage. Should even this measure pass into a law, he was convinced they would so far forget the degradation and insults offered to themselves, as to exert their utmost endeavours in seeing that the act be carried into proper effect. But it was impossible that government could again expect to find gentlemen of landed property from these counties, step forward as militia officers. There was always a deficiency in the militia in this respect; there was so at the present moment; and the measure now proposed must go greatly to increase it, and to deprive this force of great part of the character it now enjoyed. He agreed with an hon. gent. who had spoken early in the debate, that there was a great difference between the calling on the voluntary services of the militia in the year 1799 and at the present moment. Then an increase
<col>962</col>
was wanted in the disposable force of the country; of course, in extending their services, they benefited the country, which had then no occasion for their protection at home; while those by whose desire they volunteered, shewed that they esteemed their services as valuable. Now, however, the danger threatened this country, and instead of looking for assistance from this legitimate constitutional force, the government, by asking them to volunteer into the regular army, clearly informed them that as militia men, they were of no use even in the very service for which they had been raised. The plan of the noble lord seemed, so far as the militia was concerned, to carry in it the seeds of its own destruction. The noble lord in opening his plan had told the house, that there were a number of the militia within six months of the period of expiry of their service, and that there was little doubt of the whole of them enlisting to the regular army. This he thought highly unlikely. By doing so, they could receive only 10<i>l</i>. of bounty; whereas, by lying by, and waiting the operation of the ballot, they might receive from 50<i>l.</i> to 60<i>l.</i> in the first instance, and then the additional 10<i>l.</i> for extending their service. He objected to the measure still more, however, because it went to destroy the plan of his right hon. friend, from which, as had been expressed by the hon. gent. below him, he was of opinion, if allowed to take its fair course, his right hon. friend must derive immortal honour. The documents on the table shewed, that if experience was not a cheat and fact a liar, that the plan of his right hon. friend had completely succeeded. The right hon. gentlemen opposite seemed highly pleased when his hon. friend near him, (Mr. Whitbread) stated, that the plan of his right hon. friend, if it had not done more, had done as much as the Additional Force act, and the regular recruiting, at the same time. These hon. gentlemen seemed now to think this nothing, but they were not always of such an Opinion. They had fo<ob/>merly represented the Additional Force act, as in itself a measure of great efficiency, while, at the same time, as they contended, it did not at all interfere in the regular recruiting. Their language, however, was now greatly changed, and they allowed no credit to the plan of his right hon. friend, although it had proved itself superior to the Additional Force act, and the ordinary recruiting combin<ob/>e disapproved of compulsory service, which resolved int<ob/>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0504"/>
<col>963</col>
ballot, as raising up a competition against the regular recruiting, which it could not stand, and which must always drive it out of the market. He thought that voluntary service should be carried as far as it would go, and that the situation of the soldier should be rendered as comfortable as possible, as an inducement for him to enter. He desired gentlemen to recollect that this was not an emergency of a week, or of a month, or of a year, but one which would in all probability last for some time. If the house or the country therefore were content with a temporary remedy, they deceived themselves. He did not see that the plan of the noble lord could do any good. Between the two he preferred that of the army of reserve, on this principle, that if they were to resort to a mode of compulsory service in the line of the regular recruiting, that mode would do least mischief, as it interfered with no other portion of our defensive force, but allowed every thing to remain settled and undisturbed. On the subject of making a diversion in favour of our allies, the right hon. gent. had tauntingly said, that if such a thing had been thought of at an early period of the campaign by the late ministers, it might have been possible to have protracted the war. He hoped, however, gentlemen would recollect, that as, on the one hand, it might have been possible to protract the war by sending a British force to the assistance of our allies, so, on the other hand, it was equally possible, without benifiting our allies by such protracted warfare that a considerable loss in British valour, British blood, and British lives, might have been the consequence. The first expedition under lord Cathcart was not attended with any great success, not from any want of courage, skill, or bravery in that gallant officer or his troops, but from what other cause he should not say. He hoped the second expedition under the command of his lordship would be more successful. The right hon. gent. had said, that it was well known that the late ministers were to do nothing for the Catholics of Ireland, but that they would have been glad to have remained in place at the expence of sacrificing every measure of conciliation to wards them. This the noble lord denied. He had thought, that if any thing was more notorious than another, it was this, that they had refused to enter into any pledge not to advise his majesty to such acts as they might think to be for the interest of
<col>964</col>
that body, and of the kingdom of Ireland in general. If there was any thing more notorious than another, it was this, that the late ministers had other measures besides the Catholic Officers bill to propose for the good of that body. If ministers really wished to provide effectually for the defence of the country, they would speedily, he knew they must, sooner or later, do something to repair the lost condition of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Henniker</member> <membercontribution>expressed his utmost confidence in the alacrity of the militia to render all possible service to their country; and he was sure that that constitutional force would conform with the utmost cheerfulness to such arrangements as the government might think proper to adopt for strengthening the national arm, and affording due measures of defence and security to the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>felt that the present was a question of the utmost moment; and was therefore not surprized at the various opinions which had been offered in respect to the best mode of accomplishing the great purpose which was the object of the bill. Gentlemen on both sides agreed, that the present moment was one of considerable difficulty, and required, of course, more than ordinary exertion to meet the exigencies of the occasion; they acknowledged that the energy and resources of the country, should be brought forth as speedily and effectually as possible. The only difference then was, as to the mode of accomplishing the great object. For his part, he was willing to confess, that he considered the militia force as of a most efficient description; and while it approached the nearest to the regular army, was the most constitutional force we possessed. One great reason which made the transfer of the militia into the line desirable was, that whenever a peace should be concluded, the militia must be disbanded. He would ask gentlemen, whether, under the present circumstances of Europe, such a peace would reasonably be looked for, as would enable the country to dispense with such a large portion of its military establishment, as the militia constituted? He thought the house must agree with him, that we could not spare such a number of men from our means of defence; and it must be obvious to all, that there was no other way of obviating the difficulty, and preserving such a force to the country, than by permitting it in time of war to volunteer into the line. This was an effectual
<image src="S1V0009P0I0505"/>
<col>965</col>
remedy, and the deficiency thus occasioned in the militia would speedily be made good by the proposed ballot. The right hon. gent. then entered into a long detail, in order to shew the inefficiency of the military plan of the late ministers, and concluded by a strong recommendation of unanimity in opposing the common enemy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>entered at large upon the comparative merits of the bill now before the house, the plan of the present ministers, of which this was a part; and that military system which he had brought forward, and which parliament had adopted last year. The leading objection which he had to the present measure, and to the whole system of which it formed a part, was, that it was only of a temporary nature, and therefore inapplicable to the present condition of this country, which required a military system of a permanent nature. For want of attending to this distinction, we had fallen into many, and he was apprehensive we should fall into still more errors, and he feared some of them might prove fatal unless we adopted a permanent system: nothing else would serve us; for the evil against which we were to provide was of a permanent nature. The militia officers had been made the mere vehicle for recruiting; and now, when the very moment had arrived at which they expected to be called into actual service, in order to display that discipline and valour which they had been the means of fostering and exciting, their troops were to be taken from them and drafted into the regular army. Was not this more degrading to the militia than any thing which had been done to the volunteers, as alleged by the hon. gent. opposite? The right hon. gent. defended at considerable length his own training act and recruiting system; which he maintained, from the returns on the table, had answered every purpose, for which they were intended. If his system had been allowed to take its own course, we should have avoided the ruinous consequences to our militia now resorted to, of filling up the standing army front that source. He denied that the late administration had put an end to the Additional Force act; the fact was, it had put an end to itself. The question now was, shall we break up a solid system for the sake of gaining a temporary advantage?&#x2014;Where was the emergency which rendered such an injurious measure necessary?&#x2014;A word or two now as to the volunteers. There was no system which owed its existence to zeal alone, that could
<col>966</col>
long maintain any thing like a constant number. Take away their zeal, take away the impression of the moment, by which alone zeal could be excited, and they would dwindle in point of numbers, as well as sink into complete inattention and indi<ob/>erence. He would still maintain, that the volunteers under the present system, could never be made to display to advantage that spirit and energy which individually, no doubt, the greatest part of them possessed. Even with the assistance of the sinister attempts of the hon. gentlemen opposite, their physical strength and moral courage could never be brought into action in a way to tell as they ought to do. Before he concluded, he could not help remarking to the house, as one characteristic of the system which he had been concerned in, that there was not a job in it from one end to the other. He should certainly have been as happy as the hon. gent. to have provided for old, worn out, and meritorious officers, by recommending them to appointments under the volunteer system. He claimed as merit to himself, that such was his feeling; but he claimed likewise as merit, that he had, in compliance with what he thought his public duty, suppressed the institution (the inspecting field-officers), by which opportunities would have been afforded him for that purpose. The hon. gent. looked to a far better fortune. They restored the means of their own patronage and hoped at the same time to be applauded for what they had done. He charged the opposite side of the house with having not only taken advantage, when they came into office, of the cry of "no popery," but of having turned the cry of "no volunteers" also to some advantage. When the general election came on, they appealed to the volunteers, telling them they had been degraded and insulted by their predecessors; but now was the time to shew their loyalty, by voting for ministers and their friends, and they would, in return, restore them to their former splendour.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bathurst</member> <membercontribution>thought that there was no ground for supposing that the present measure would completely counteract the operation of the plan of the right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham); occasions would frequently occur in which it would be necessary to make an exertion for procuring a considerable accession of force; but such emergencies could only produce a temporary obstruction to the measure, and would
<image src="S1V0009P0I0506"/>
<col>967</col>
by no means subvert it, as had been maintained. He, however, could not approve of the present plan, and in particular objected to it on the ground that while it called for a supply of force from the militia, it proposed to fill up the deficiency created by an immediate ballot. He thought that the proceeding implied an opinion in those who proposed it, that the militia was not a proper force for home defence, for it was for home defence only the present measure could be thought necessary, as the country already possessed a sufficient force for foreign service.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>could not forbear making a few observations even at that late hour of the night. He lamented to meet with such opposition from different quarters, and on such different grounds. Some did not think the emergency so urgent as others, and therefore were for adopting no measure at all. Some were for making greater, others less drafts from the militia; while others again deprecated the touching it altogether. The militia was allowed to be in a higher state of perfection, and to be more complete in officers, than at any former period for these 14 years. Why, then, did it not furnish more facilities than at any former moment towards the object which it was now so necessary to attend to and to accomplish? Our military force was now more scattered abroad than at any former period: it was therefore more necessary to feed and compact that force than before. He did not flatter himself with a nearer prospect of peace than the gentlemen on the other side: but this he felt, that our military system should be adapted to both situations, and partake of either prospect. When so calculated, it might be framed and kept up at a smaller expence. As to the right hon. gent. who spoke last but one, he seemed to lose sight altogether of the dangers which he formerly dreaded from France. His apprehensions on that score seemed wholly to have vanished, and all his faculties seemed now to be absorbed in the admiration of his own military plan, which he seemed to think had succeeded beyond his most sanguine dreams. Still, however, all that happy result was yet to come. We were to look for it at the distance of two years; and in the interim, it seems, were to expect that Bonaparte would become grey, and be no longer anxious for any thing but peace; and then we should be able to defend the country without any measure like that he
<col>968</col>
had the honour to propose. Such, however, was not the opinion of that great man (Mr. Fox), who was now no more, and whose extraordinary talents added such authority to any opinion he expressed. He thought it necessary our military force should be raised to the utmost pitch, and such as should surpass the proudest periods of our military renown. Let us compare, however, the dangers of the country, even at that day, with what they now were, and how would they appear increased? when the powers of the continent were so much less able to assist us, and when we had an enemy to contend with, so much more confident of victory and flushed with new triumphs. Besides, our disposable force under these aggravated difficulties was rendered less available by the late administration, who had scattered it in so many directions, and who had made no preparation whatever towards averting these dangers. On the 24th of January last, the moment when they should have been preparing for some active enterprise to open the campaign, they dismissed from the public service every transport that was not absolutely necessary for the ordinary routine business of the Channel service, and nothing was left for offensive operations. Whatever expedition, therefore, it might have been prudent to undertake, not a shadow of preparation was left to support it. By the former administration, not a single exertion was made to rescue Prussia; she was suffered to perish before our eyes. Such was the situation in which they had left the present ministers, with nothing to inherit from them but weakness, difficulties, and distress.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>expressed his surprise, that, after his majesty's ministers had deprecated all personal allusions, the noble lord should have made charges of a nature similar to that with which he concluded his speech, and should have taken the opportunity of making so uncandid an attack, when all the members of the late administration had spoken in the debate. Whatever was to be regretted in the distribution of the public force by the late government, he contended was the necessary result of the impolitic measures of their predecessors. He also remarked, that before they could be justly censured for any of their measures, they ought to be permitted to disclose the general plan, of which those measures were perhaps only parts. He did not pretend to have a knowledge of what
<image src="S1V0009P0I0507"/>
<col>969</col>
had passed in their councils, but this much, however, he could say, that he understood the late administration had an expedition in contemplation, that would have been worthy of them and of the country, and which the present ministers would not dare to look at.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>stated, that the late ministers had left to their successors a much greater number of transports than had been received from them. If the noble lord thought the late ministers had failed to do their duty in any particular, he wished him to bring the matter before the house, when they might have an opportunity of vindicating their conduct.&#x2014;The question was then called for, when a division took place,

Smith</member> <membercontribution>proposed that in consequence of the lateness of the hour (nearly half-past four o'clock), the further proceeding on the 3d reading should be postponed till to-morrow. Upon this, a division took place; we could not learn the numbers, but the motion was lost by a considerable majority.&#x2014;By this time the clause was engrossed; upon the question, that it stand part of the bill, there was another division nearly the same as on the last question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir, J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>then moved the alteration of the duration of the bill from two years to one; upon this a third division took place: For the motion 28; against it 112. A long debate next ensued on the question that the bill do now pass.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. J. W. Ward</member> <membercontribution>expressed strong doubts as
<col>970</col>
to the propriety of agreeing to the bill, after every attempt to amend it had been rejected. He was particularly astonished that the house had negatived the amendment on the duration of the bill, and asked what the people of this country would think, were the Mutiny bill to be passed for more than one year, though it was doubtless as necessary as this bill could possibly be? He, however, acknowledged that the great weight of the authority (Mr. Grattan's) which the house had heard in support of the bill, induced him reluctantly to vote for its passing into a law.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>was decidedly against the bill, and was determined to oppose the motion for passing it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, he could not agree to the bill in any shape; but most particularly the amendments, which would make it in some degree palatable, were rejected. If, said he, the time of reading the bill a third time had afforded me the best possible opportunity of delivering my sentiments on it at such length as I chose, I should not have profited by the advantage. I certainly did wish, and mean, to have selected the fittest occasion for giving fully my reasons for the abhorrence I feel for its principle, and the contempt I entertain for its provisions; but circumstances have since embarrassed my judgment, and I will state them shortly and sincerely. When I find the principle of the bill admitted on the plea of necessity by all those to whose judgement and information I am bound to pay the utmost deference, when I find I cannot oppose their acquiescence without arraying my knowledge of the fact of the real situation and temper of Ireland against their superior means of information, I feel the presumption and hazard of taking upon myself the responsibility of an earnest endeavour to persuade the house to reject a measure which I am almost single in regarding as the worst, the foulest, and the foolishest measure that ever solicited the sanction of parliament; but still more am I influenced by observing in my attendance on the committee, where I avow to have shunned taking any part, washing my hands, and absolving my conscience from meddling with, or tampering in any attempt to mend that which is so hateful in principle that it is perhaps best that it should carry with it all its unequal proportion of deformity. I say, I cannot but have been induced to forego my first determination, by observing that so many efforts at modifica-

<col>971</col>
tion, moved by most respectable characters, and supported by the most unanswerable arguments, have been rejected and reprobated by insulting majorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>re-stated, that he had been informed that there were held in Ireland treasonable meetings, for the purpose of organizing a force to assist the French. The bill was to put down the French interest in Ireland, not to oppress the Irish nation. He did not mean to accuse his countrymen of treason or disaffection; but he was certain, that there was a French party in Ireland; it was against them, and not against Irishmen, that the operation of the bill was directed; and sooner than run a risk of losing the constitution altogether, he would take upon himself his full share, in common with his majesty's ministers, of the responsibility which would attach to the measure.&#x2014;The house then divided on the motion that the bill do now pass. The numbers were, Ayes 106; Noes 8; Majority 98. Adjourned at half-past 6 on Tuesday morning.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<date format="1807-07-28">Tuesday, July 28.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.] Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>brought down a Message from the King, announcing that his majesty had entered into subsidiary engagements with the king of Sweden; that his majesty's minister at the court of Prussia had advanced 100,000<i>l</i>. to the Prussian government; and that his majesty had furnished arms for the Prussian army, to the amount of 200,000<i>l</i>. more. (See the message in the proceedings of the house of commons.) His lordship moved, that the message be taken into consideration to-morrow. This motion gave rise to a short conversation. Lord Holland and lord Lauderdale expressed their surprise that so short a time was afforded, and thought that parliament could not be expected to give their approbation to the arrangements with Sweden, until the treaty was produced. Lord Hawkesbury remarked, that all that Would be proposed by the address to-morrow, would be to return thanks to his majesty's for his gracious communication. His majesty's ministers certainly did not mean to call on their lordships to approve the stipulations, the conditions of which were not yet known to them. Lord Lauderdale said, that at least the amount of the subsidies ought to have been mentioned in the message; that was a species of information which he under-
<col>972</col>
stood was usually given in messages of this kind. In the message relative to the loan to the emperor of Germany last war, the amount of that loan was expressed. The message was fixed for consideration to-morrow.&#x2014;Lord Hawkesbury delivered another message from his majesty, (see the house of commons,) recommending it to parliament to make provision for such measure as might be necessary to meet any emergencies during the present crisis. In reply to a question from lord Holland, lord Hawkesbury said, that it was merely the usual message delivered at the close of every session, in order to form the foundation of a vote of credit. This message was also ordered to be taken into consideration to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-07-28">Tuesday, July 28.</date>
<p><member>[MINUTES.] Mr. alderman Shaw</member> <membercontribution>offered a petition from W. Spurrier, who had been ordered to attend the house, to answer as to the detention of the Poole writ. The petition went to excuse the conduct of the petitioner, who prayed the indulgence of the house. The Speaker suggested, that it was informal to receive a petition from an individual ordered to attend in his person. The individual would have an opportunity to offer his excuse in the course of his examination at the bar.&#x2014;A new writ was ordered for the county of Kinross, in the room of Mr. Adam, who, having been elected for Kincardineshire also, had made his election to serve for the latter.&#x2014;Mr. secretary Canning presented at the bar a copy of the treaty of amity, enterred into between his majesty and the king of Prussia. The right hon. secretary stated that this treaty had been framed at Memel on the 28th of January; but the ratification of the king of Prussia had not arrived for many months after, and the events that had since occurred had entirely superseded the provisions agreed upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[KING'S MESSAGE RELATIVE TO ENGAGEMENTS WITH SWEDEN, &amp;c.] Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>brought up a message from the king, which was read from the chair as follows: "G. R. His majesty thinks it proper to acquaint the house of commons, that he has entered into certain subsidiary engagements with the king of Sweden, copies of which, as soon as the ratifications shall have been exchanged, his majesty will direct to be
<image src="S1V0009P0I0509"/>
<col>973</col>
communicated to the house.&#x2014;His majesty also thinks proper to acquaint the house of commons, that his majesty's minister to the king of Prussia has, in consequence of authority from his majesty, and of the urgency of affairs upon the continent, advanced to the Prussian government the sum of 100,000<i>l</i>. sterling; and that his majesty has, in the course of the campaign, furnished to the Prussian government supplies of arms and other military stores to an amount not exceeding in the whole the sum of 200,000<i>l</i>. sterling; and his majesty trusts that the house will enable him to make good the same."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>said, that in moving that his majesty's most gracious message be referred to the committee of supply, it might perhaps be agreeable to the gentlemen on the opposite side of the house, that he should shortly state the nature of the treaties mentioned in the message. The one was a subsidiary treaty with the king of Sweden, by which we had agreed to pay for the furnishing a further contingent of men for the defence of Swedish Pomerania and of Stralsund. The number before employed for those purposes, for which this country paid, was 14,000 men, and it was proposed to make an addition of 4,000, which were to be paid for at the same rate as the others were. This was not, however, the contingent to which he had alluded on a former day. It would be recollected that a question had been put to him by an hon. gent. some time ago relative to treaties with the northern powers, and he had then mentioned that there were contingencies which were not then finally settled, which prevented the necessary communications on that subject being made. Those contingencies were certain subsidiary treaties which his majesty's ministers had entered upon with the king of Prussia, and which the unfortunate circumstances that had put an end to the war on the continent, had prevented from being brought to a conclusion. Had they taken place, the 100,000<i>l</i>. paid to the king of Prussia would have been included&#x2014;and something less than 200,000<i>l</i>. in arms and ammunition furnished by his majesty's government to the king of Prussia would have been included in the sum to have been granted; but As those treaties, from the circumstances before alluded to, had not been concluded, his majesty had ordered them to laid
<col>974</col>
before parliament, that the money might be provided for by them. He moved, therefore, that his majesty's message be referred to the committee of supply.&#x2014;Ordered.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[KING'S MESSAGE RESPECTING A VOTE OF CREDIT.] The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>brought up another message from the king, which was read from the chair as follows: "G. R. His majesty, relying on the uniform loyalty and zeal of his faithful commons, and considering that it may be of the utmost importance at this arduous crisis, to provide for such emergencies as may arise, recommends it to this house, to make provision for enabling his majesty to take all such measures as the exigencies of affairs may require, in order to counteract and defeat the intentions and plans of his enemies, and to provide for the safety of his majesty's dominions, and to maintain the honour of his crown."&#x2014;This message was also referred to the committee of supply.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[COMPLAINT RESPECTING THE POOLE WRIT.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion of Mr. Jeffery, the house went into the further consideration of the Complaint of the delay in the delivery of the Poole writ.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Jonathan Brundrett</member> <membercontribution>was called in, and on examination stated, that he received the writ on the morning of the 30th of April, and delivered it to Mr. James Weston, at two o'clock on the same day in Fen-church-street, in the presence of an old gentleman, who, he afterwards found, was Mr. Spurrier. He recognized, Mr. Spurrier when he went to Poole to ascertain the delivery of the writ. He arrived in Poole on Monday, the 18th of May, and saw Mr. Spurrier, who told him the writ had been delivered. He was satisfied on hearing that it was delivered, relying on Mr. Spurrier's veracity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. William</member> <membercontribution>Spurrier was then called in. Being very deaf, the clerk was ordered to stand by him and repeat the questions that were put. Being desired by the Speaker to address his answers to him, he said that he could not see him [a laugh].&#x2014;On examination stated he had received the writ on the 30th of April last. He delivered the writ on the 17th of May, where he was satisfied the sheriff received it. His ignorance was the sole cause of his holding over the writ so long. No person at Poole knew of his having the writ. The sheriff of Poole is his relation, his wife's brother. He knew
<image src="S1V0009P0I0510"/>
<col>975</col>
of no enquiry after the writ till the Saturday before he delivered it. He never knew that the writ was cried at Poole. He knew of a person who was not of age at the time he received the writ, and who was of age at the time when he delivered it. This person could not have voted if he had delivered the writ immediately. This person was no relation of his, neither was any of the candidates. He thought that person would have voted for Mr. Garland, but he voted for sir R. Bickerton. He was in London, and took the writ to take care of it, knowing it would be in safe hands, He did not deliver it, because like a bill of exchange drawn at forty days sight, he did not think it right to deliver it till the period when it should be obligatory to make the return [a laugh]. He paid 30 guineas for the writ; it was what he was asked to pay: he was not repaid, nor did he expect to be. He knew from the beginning, that he was to pay money for the writ, but he did not know how much. He was prepared to pay what should be asked of him. On a question from the chancellor of the exchequer, he admitted that he had heard there were to have been other candidates, besides those who stood. On being questioned who, he answered. sir Home Popham. His (Mr. Spurrier's) son also was expected to have been a candidate [a laugh]. He admitted that he knew of a person who arrived with the most urgent expedition from Ireland, and voted for Mr. Garland. On a question from Mr. Jones, he admitted that his principal reason for getting possession of the writ was, that his son intended to have been a candidate. He did not look for a receipt of the writ, because he relied on the sheriff's honourable character. Neither the sheriff nor any other person in Poole, knew that he had had the writ, till the proceedings on the present investigation had been the means of letting them into the fact.&#x2014;Mr. Spurrier having been then ordered to withdraw,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, it had been universally admitted, that some remedy was necessary in the present practice of issuing writs. A remedy was to be proposed by an hon. gent. on the other side (Mr. Barham). Every gentleman would lend his aid to render this remedy more perfect, and when it should have received the concurrence of the other branches of the legislature, he hoped it would be effectual. With respect to the present
<col>976</col>
case, he did not think it would be right to press hard upon the individual, But as it was evident that the obtaining and delaying of the writ, had arisen from some motives not perfectly correct, he thought some animadversion should take place, though he was of opinion that any punishment the house should think proper to inflict, ought to cease, as soon as an opportunity to terminate it should be afforded by petition from the individual.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>suggested that the first proceeding ought to be a resolution, that Mr. William Spurrier, in unduly detaining the writ for the last election for members to serve in parliament for the county of the town of Poole for 17 days, had been guilty of a breach of the privileges of that house. The question being put on this resolution,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>felt it was quite impossible to refuse his assent to the resolution, but from the universality of similar practices, of which some instances little short of that now before the house had been communicated to him very recently, he thought the individual now under the animadversion of the house ought to be discharged as soon after his committal as possible. He urged the propriety of adopting a general remedy for the abuse; such a remedy was essential to the honour and character of the house, in preference to severity in a particular instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, an hon. gent. on the other side had proposed to introduce a general remedial measure, which he was sure every gentleman would be ready to support. He intended to move, that Mr. Spurrier be committed to the custody of the serjeant at arms; and though it was not parliamentary to speak of an understanding to that effect, he was sure, that as soon as a proper submission should be made, the house would give the relief required.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>urged the propriety of a general remedy, and, with a view to obtain, some information calculated to promote that object, proposed to call in and examine, the messenger of the great seal as to the general proceedings about the issue of writs.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>objected to the examination the messenger of the great seal, who could speak to nothing beyond the practice of his office. The messenger of the great seal, was particularly instructed to take no fees but those that custom had established (perhaps without right); five guineas for a writ for a borough, and twice as much for
<image src="S1V0009P0I0511"/>
<col>977</col>
a writ for a county or city. The principal remedy for the abuses complained of was to provide for the immediate delivery of the writ to the sheriff.&#x2014;It was then resolved, that W. Spurrier was guilty of a breach of the privileges of the house, and he was ordered to be committed to the custody of the serjeant at arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>took occasion to state, that the committal of Mr. Brundrett to Newgate on a former night, was grounded on his unqualified refusal to answer questions. This was an offence, without the immediate punishment and correction of which, the house could not proceed in any of the investigations and enquiries essential to its constitution. The nature of the case enquired into, depended upon the facts that should be disclosed and discovered, and admitted of quite a different course of proceeding.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Jeffery</member> <membercontribution>stated, that the messenger of the great seal, and the other persons ordered to attend at the bar, were not at all implicated in the criminal part of the transaction. He therefore moved, that the order for their attendance be discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>then moved, that the deputy messenger of the crown be called to the bar. This was opposed by sir John Sinclair, and the gallery was cleared for a division, but, after some discussion, the motion was withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MILITIA TRANSFER BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The house having resolved itself into a committee of the whole house, on the Militia Transfer bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>rose. The emergency to call for a measure so oppressive as this, was not, he said, made out. If the French fleets had been victorious, then indeed there might have been a ground for some strong compulsory measure. The militia was the constitutional force of the country, and ought not to thus tampered with and degraded, especially when the object at present was not to procure a force for foreign service, but for the defence of the country. It Was impossible now to look for conquests on the continent, or to expect to stop the progress of Bonaparte. At the first establishment of the militia the service was in a great measure of a personal nature. Now, however, it was merely a tax on the country, and a tax which, by the operation of the ballot, Would be most partially and most unjustly levied. It was levied entirely on the landed property, and not on the whole,
<col>978</col>
but on a part of it, Peers were exempted, and clergymen and infants, and lands mortmain. And on this account he would always object to the militia, except so far as they formed a garrison for our homes. It ought also to be considered whether the families of those who volunteered in this manner, were to be chargeable to the parishes, in the same manner, as if they had still continued in the militia. Whether they were or not, the present measure was equally objectionable. It they should be entitled to the relief, then this would be imposing a most grievous burthen upon the parishes, which would be charged both with their families and with the families of those who were to replace them. It their families were not to be provided for, it was a most cruel injustice to the men, and to those families which might thus be left destitute. But he had another strong objection to this measure. It had been clearly made out that it interfered very materially with the military plan of his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), a plan which the present ministers seemed to wish to subvert by a side wind. This plan had been highly successful for the time it had been in operation as appeared from the returns on the table. He knew it had been successful in the country, and had the approbation of those who were to carry it into execution. It was said that there was an emergency, and that we must make a sudden exertion; but the danger was, that by these continued exertions the country would be exhausted when the most pressing occasion arrived. Emergencies might thus be said to have arrived after the battle of Austerlitz; after that of Auerstadt, and that of Friedland. But the population of the country must be prepared for a long protracted war, which it could not be with these continual paralysing efforts, resting principally on the landed property. There was no vigour in the present measure, but if there was, he should doubt of its propriety; for by these exertions we must exhaust ourselves before we had run half our race. The plan of his fight hon. friend below, was exactly calculated for our present situation; for it was intended to meet a long protracted war, and had every appearance of being sufficient to answer that important purpose. That plan would be rising in its efficacy every day. The present measure would be constantly decreasing in its effects, and not only do little good itself, but prevent the other plan from having its proper influence.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0512"/>
<col>979</col>
For these reasons he had voted against the measure: but, however, after the decision of the house, he would not at present oppose the Speaker's leaving the chair; but he had thought it incumbent upon him to state his reasons for his former vote, and the grounds on which he thought the present measure not only useless but mischievous.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Thomas Turton</member> <membercontribution>declared that he would rather wish to augment than diminish the militia. But he had strong objections to the system of ballot, on account of the malignity with which it operated. The ballot might fall upon a man of no property, or it might fall upon him (sir T. Turton). As to the chances, they were on an equality. But for 20 guineas he could procure a substitute, and this was nothing to him; but it might he every thing to the other, and therefore it was that the tax was grossly unequal. He thought the late ministers deserving of great praise for having suspended the ballot, and he really wished that some means might be found, by which the expence of this measure should be more equalised.&#x2014;Indeed, he entirely approved of what the late ministers had done with regard to the continent, with one exception and that was, that they had not promptly assisted our allies alter the battle of Eylau, for then there appeared a prospect of stopping the career of the French, when they had received this check from the Russians. If he had had any influence over the councils of his majesty, he certainly would have advised that a strong force should have been sent to the continent on that occasion. He had always disapproved to sending expeditions to the continent to save Europe; for if Europe was not able to save itself, it was impossible that it could be done by Great Britain. We, therefore ought to reserve our forces instead of sending them on these foolish expeditions. But now, whether we should be at peace or not, we must always be armed, perhaps for a century. Since we must then be a armed, in God's name, let us have the force as constitutional as we can. He would cheerfully consent, however, to give ministers the force they wanted for the line, if they thought it useful for harassing the enemy, provided it could be done without the evils arising from the inequality of the ballot. The principle of the army of reserve, however, which had been so much insisted upon by those who themselves formed a sort of political reserve in that house,
<col>980</col>
he thought even more objectionable than that now proposed to be adopted. It was true, more men were procured by the Reserve act; but at the same time it occasioned a great deal more hardship and oppression. He expressed his approbation of the volunteer system properly conducted. This ought to be encouraged by paying the volunteers for their loss of time. He thought some inspecting field-officers necessary, and observed that the expence of the whole was small in comparison with the benefit. He denied, however, that the numbers of the volunteers were so great as they were stated. He concluded by saying, that he should have no objection to the measure, provided the inequality of the ballet could be remedied.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Wood</member> <membercontribution>had hoped, that in the present situation of the country, all party considerations would have been laid aside; and expressed his astonishment at the sentiments that had been promulgated on this subject. With great reluctance he gave his consent to the deterioration of that most constitutional force, the militia; but when he reflected on the present state of Europe, it was impossible for him to withhold it. He thought, that the plan of his noble friend was the only one that could give the desireable force. A right hon. gent. had last night said, that we had nothing to apprehend, because Bonaparte and his army were at such a distance; but in six months they might be on the opposite shores. He then entered into the best mode of defence in case of invasion, end recommended strongly the erection of Martello towers, and the fortifications of our arsenals and dockyards, which were now unable to resist a, siege of a fortnight or three weeks. He should give the present question his decided support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Davits Giddy </member>, <membercontribution>although he could not approve, in every point, of the plan of the late right hon. secretary of state for the war department, yet thought that, if suffered to proceed, it would be very productive, and he regretted that the noble lord's plan would interfere with it. Still, however, it appeared that some sort of compulsion was necessary to provide a large military force, but he did not altogether see the utility of the volunteering from the militia, and expressed his preference of a ballot directly for the army. As a majority of the house, however, had determined in favour of the noble lord's plan, he should cheerfully acquiesce in that determination.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0513"/>
<col>981</col>
<p><member>Sir G. Warrender</member> <membercontribution>repeated his former arguments on this subject, and contended that the disposable force now existing was amply sufficient. His grand objection to the noble lord's plan was, that it applied a temporary remedy to a permanent evil, while the plan of his right hon. friend opposed a permanent remedy to a permanent evil. If a proper object for expeditions presented itself, he was far from disapproving of them, provided they were properly conducted. When the French were driven out of Italy, and an expedition was sent to the Helder, which at first promised to be successful, he thought that a good ground existed for the volunteering of the militia into the line at that time. But now there was no opportunity for any great expedition, and therefore he thought this measure of very little use, while it occasioned a great deal of mischief. But after the decision already come to, he could not expect to succeed in any opposition he might now give to it. It ought to be considered however, that the regiments were far removed from their respective counties, and that a great deal of difficulty would attend the collecting of the recruits. If the measure should pass into a law, he should undoubtedly do his endeavour to give it effect. Notwithstanding, however, the partiality he felt for the gentlemen on his side (the opposition side)#x2014;a partiality of which he certainly had no reason to be ashamed&#x2014;he assured the gentlemen on the other side, that he would have opposed this measure though it had come from those whom he thought much better entitled to his confidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Babington</member> <membercontribution>was of opinion that our regular force ought to be much augmented; and though he approved of this measure so far as it went, yet he thought that the addition of 36,000 men was much too small. It was not enough to have a force large enough to meet the enemy at the onset. We ought to have a reserve in case we lost one or two battles. He was surprized that so little stress had been laid upon the training of the population of the country; as the population of our enemy was military, it was necessary that ours should be military also. The actual enforcement of some measure for training the people, would have the effect of bringing many recruits into the line. This had happened in the case of the Army of Reserve act, for at that time many had entered that service from the idea that the
<col>982</col>
Defence act was about to be enforced; for they reasoned in this way, that if they must serve, it was as well to do it in one way as in another. He concluded by declaring his assent to the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Cochrane</member> <membercontribution>thought the unequal operation of the ballot the most serious objection to the plan of the noble lord. At the same time, he entirely approved of permitting the militia to volunteer into the line: the present emergency called for a large disposable force, and he thought the best way of getting that force was the one proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Bagwell</member> <membercontribution>did not think the numerical force of the line would be so much increased as seemed to be anticipated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham rose</member>, <membercontribution>not for the purpose of going at length into the consideration of the bill, but because some very important points relating to this subject had been mistated. The gentlemen on the other side seemed to confine their attention to one or two points only, of the measures which he had brought forward; but there were others, such as the Training act, which they had abstained from speaking of altogether. If the noble lord (Castlereagh) only found fault with some particular points of his bill, he would allow that, like all other bills of a general nature, it was capable of improvement, but he would not allow that there was more to be corrected or supplied than in other bills of this nature. He was ready to join the noble lord, or any other gentleman, in correcting whatever part of his bill might require correction. When he had brought forward the Training act, it was his opinion that it would constitute a great reservoir to feed and supply the regular army. He could not conceive what title the plan of the noble lord had to be called a grand measure, even to meet an emergency. What was it more than the difference between 36,000 men raised for the militia, and the number which the former plan would have raised? He thought that it had very little claim indeed to the character of a grand measure. He did not, however, wish to press that consideration farther at present, as there would be another opportunity of discussing the merits of the bill. Nor was it his wish now to answer at any length the objection which had been thrown out against the conduct of the late administration in the remission of fines to the different parishes. He should barely state, that the question on that point was, whether or not those fines could be levied without injus-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0514"/>
<col>983</col>
tice? It was not stating the matter correctly to say, that by this means, parishes that had made no exertion, and had incurred no expense, were placed exactly on a footing with those who had made exertion. The fact was most notorious, that there were many was parishes that used every exertion which the law allowed, and could by no possibility obtain the men, while others obtained the men by exertions which were not allowed by the law. The question then was, whether those latter parishes should have an advantage over those who had done every thing which they could legally do, without being able to procure any men. The difference between the present bill and the one he had the honour to propose, appeared to him to be exactly that difference which was described by his noble friend (lord Milton), when he described <ob/> as the difference between a present and a permanent measure. He denied that any measure of his had produced the diminution in the number of volunteers which had been stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Tarleton </member>, <membercontribution>said that the measures of the right hon. gent. had certainly contributed very much to dispirit the volunteers, as he himself had witnessed in the different districts with which he was best acquainted. He could not agree with the opinion of those who stated that the inspecting field-officers were of no use, and that their duty could be sufficiently discharged by the general officers of the district. The district which he commanded, comprised seven English counties, and 3 Welch ones, and 170 volunteer corps: it would be absolutely impossible that one general of a district should superintend so many corps who were widely dispersed over his district. He was therefore very glad that such power Was lodged in the inspecting field-officers. He considered that the improving the nature of the volunteer force would supersede the necessity of the Training act, and many other oppressive measures to which the people must otherwise be subject. He thought most highly of the militia force, and had a much better opinion of them than of the second battalions. He considered that the militia regiments possessed in a high degree the health and stamina of the country; and if the English and Irish militia would readily interchange their services he considered that there would be no occasion for the present measure. It was merely because he did not find the superior officers of the militia
<col>984</col>
ready to make this interchange, that he thought it advisable to draft, from the militia. He was surprized that gentlemen on the other side of the house should not perceive an emergency which called for extraordinary measures, when the first general of the age had collected such an immense army, and was now more completely at, leisure than he was at any former period, to direct his entire attention to the subjugation of this country. He had seen many of the second battalions, and from the number of boys among them, he considered that they were much inferior to the militia regiments as they were at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Shaw Lofevre</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the county of Leicester, to which an hon. gent. (Mr. Babington) belonged, who had taken a part in this debate, had employed means contrary to law to raise men by crimps and excessive bounties. Knowing, as he did, the hardships imposed upon individuals by the different mode of applying the ballot, he still considered, that the army of reserve plan was an easier and cheaper means of raising men, than the plan proposed by the noble lord. He expressed doubt whether the supplemented militia could be raised to the full extent proposed by the measure, whilst there was a certain proportion of the former supplemental militia at serving in the militia.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>replied, that the objection was a legal, not a political one, but declared it to be his opinion, that alter the supplemental militia had been reduced or incorporated with the original militia, it was perfectly competent to his majesty and the legislature to call out the amount of supplemental militia proposed.<lb/>
The house then resolved itself into a committee on the bill, in which the various blanks were filled up, after much discussion, conformably to the general outline of the plan opened by the noble framer. When the bill had been gone through,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh rose</member> <membercontribution>to propose a clause which should have for its object, to allow the militia an option either to enter into the army for the term of 7 years, or for life. He by no means conceived that the plan of the right hon. gent. (Mr Windham) held out those superior inducements which gentlemen on the other side appeared to imagine. He could state one circumstance that strongly inclined him to think that it did not. When it was judged necessary to encourage men to volunteer from the militia for the expedition to Holland, the terms
<image src="S1V0009P0I0515"/>
<col>985</col>
given, were ten guineas bounty to every man who volunteered for general service for five years in Europe. At the same time, lord Cornwallis, who was then lord lieutenant of Ireland, thought it would be better to try whether he could not get the men to volunteer from the Irish militia for general service for life. For this purpose, he proposed 10 guineas to those who enlisted for five years; and 12 guineas to those who should enlist for life, and yet out of 9,000 who enlisted, there were only about 250 Who did not prefer the additional two guineas with the condition of serving for life. This was a strong fact against the measures of the right hon. gent. He thought that the gentlemen the other side, ought to be very glad that such an opportunity was afforded of immediately comparing the effect of the two systems. One great object which induced him to bring in the clause, was the serious mischief which would result from discharging such a large proportion of an army in the same year, as they would become entitled to their discharge nearly at the same time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>had one general objection against offering the option proposed in the clause, because it would materially interfere with the system now in existence. The necessity of bringing up such a clause a strong argument against the measure of the noble lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War </member>, <membercontribution>in confirmation of the argument of his noble friend, sated that the force that would be raised within the present year by his measure, and by the ordinary recruiting, would amount to 43,000 men; and if so large a proportion of our military force were to be entitled to their discharge at the end of seven years, it might be productive of much mischief.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Littleton</member> <membercontribution>should give a decided negative to this clause, thus surreptitiously introduced into the bill without notice, to subvert the system at present in force. Why had the clause not been produced at first on the face of the bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>to correct the mistake of the hon. gent., reminded the committee, that his noble friend had, in the first instance, stated his intention to bring forward this clause in the committee. The reason why they had not introduced the clause on the face of the bill was, that his noble friend wished to take the sense of the house on the general principle of his measure on the second reading of the bill, without endangering its adoption, if there
<col>986</col>
should be any general objection to such a clause. For the same reason, he chose to take the sense of the committee on the clause, which, if rejected, would not affect the general measure. This enlistment was to be only of a temporary nature, and therefore, to allow the option would not be to depart from the uniform permanent mode or recruiting. On their own principle, the gentlemen opposite ought to agree to the clause, because, though their system was at first to apply to all men serving in the army who had served 21 years, they had been deterred front acting upon it, when they found that the number to be discharged amounted to 6,000. To be consistent therefore, they who were afraid to discharge 6,000 then serving, but not raised under the provisions of their system, should not object to giving an option that would have the effect of preventing the whole of so large a force as 23,000 men, not raised under their plan, from being entitled to their discharge at the same time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord G. Cavendish</member> <membercontribution>argued against the clause, and contended, that it would be nugatory, because for the same bounty any man must prefer the limited to the unlimited period of service.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Babington</member> <membercontribution>felt rather jealous of any measure that went to disturb that which had already been laid down for limited service, and from which it was most natural to expect the most beneficial result.&#x2014;A long conversation then took place on the merits of the clause, between lords Castlereagh and Milton, general Phipps, Mr. T. Jones, Mr. Ward, general Tarleton, Mr. Giddy, the Secretary at War, and Mr. Lockhart. Afterwards a division took place: For the Clause, 73; Against it, 10; Majority, 63. The house being resumed, Mr. Hobhouse brought up the report, which was ordered to be received to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-07-29">Wednesday, July 29</date>
<p><member>[KING'S MESSAGES RELATING TO SWEDEN AND PRUSSIA.] Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day, for taking into consideration the gracious communications which he had yesterday the honour of delivering to the house. In moving an address of thanks to his majesty for these communications, he only followed in form the usual proceeding of the house; and as to the object and matter of the first of them, he did not anticipate any material objection. It simply announced, that a treaty
<image src="S1V0009P0I0516"/>
<col>987</col>
had been entered into with his Swedish majesty to subsidize a certain number of Swedish troops to be employed on a particular service, and which treaty rested on the basis of the former one: the only difference being, that instead of 14,000. men for which the former treaty stipulated, the present treaty made an addition of 4000 men to the former, making in the whole 18,000 men; the addition to be on the same terms as the number of troops originally stipulated. With respect to what regarded Prussia, there could scarcely be any difference of opinion; as the urgency of his Prussian majesty's affairs appeared to require it. Some advances of money had been made to relieve him. In addition to the 80,000<i>l</i>. advanced by the late administration, his majesty's present government had made a further addition of 100,000<i>l</i>.; the other assistance in arms, ammunition, &amp;c. amounted to 200,000<i>l</i>. These were the sums to be made good; and the object of the address he was about to move was, that their lordships do concur in making good the sums. His lordship concluded with moving and reading an address to that effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>would not object to the address; but, at the same time, he could not help observing, that he was at a loss to conceive the grounds upon which ministers proceeded in making this second treaty, if they saw that his Swedish majesty was unable to carry the first into execution. No doubt his Swedish majesty would have done every thing in his power to fulfil his engagement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>felt very anxious to be informed, if the papers upon the table contained every thing which his majesty's ministers had done towards procuring continental co-operation, and more intimately cementing our continental connections and alliances. If they had done no more, how could they justify the language which they put into his majesty's speech, at the close of the last session? A pompous paragraph was there introduced, which held forth to the country the assurance, that ministers had been employed in drawing closer the ties that connected us with our allies, and in preparing the means of co-operation and concert, by which alone a rational hope could be entertained of resisting the ambition of the enemy, and of finally procuring a solid and safe peace. Surely, what appeared from the papers now upon the table, could contribute little or
<col>988</col>
nothing towards the accomplishment of that object. With what views then could ministers have introduced into the king's speech, this big promise of doing a great deal, while in effect they had done nothing, except with the invidious one of endeavouring insidiously to contrast their own conduct with that of their predecessors in office?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>thanked the noble lord for having afforded him this opportunity of explanation. The passage in the speech to which the noble lord had alluded promised no more than his majesty's ministers had been prepared to perform. Their propositions to the continental powers were not confined to what appeared in the papers now before their lordships, but embraced offers of much greater magnitude in case of further and more extensive co-operation. But they still kept pace with the efforts, which those powers were likely to make, and with the degree of effect with which it was probable they might be attended. Unfortunately, however, the hopes of this more effectual and successful co-operation were now at an end; and no more pecuniary advances had been made to our allies than those referred to in his majesty's message.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>here took occasion to inveigh against the principle of holding out to foreign powers the temptation of subsidies, in order to excite them to take a part in the war. He himself had witnessed the mischievous effects of that principle, and it was one which he should ever reprobate and resist, as influencing the conduct of this country, with respect to its continental connections. The attempt prematurely to plunge other powers into hostilities had made the most unfavourable impression abroad, Such allurements on our part seemed to make the subjects of the sovereigns in alliance with us imagine that their governments bartered their blood for British gold, and so far that idea went to destroy the moral energy by which they might wield the physical strength which we were so ready to purchase from them. He should ever set his face therefore against the throwing out of such enticements, and he had seriously to regret that we had too long and too often acted upon that principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Mulgrave</member> <membercontribution>was astonished to hear the noble lord indulge in such observations, and impute to his majesty's government motives and views which had never guided their conduct. Where was the proof that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0517"/>
<col>989</col>
his majesty's present ministers ever held out subsidies as allurements and enticements to draw other powers into the war; and what opinion must the noble lord entertain of those powers of the continent, who, while their crowns, their dominions, their honour, their independence, every thing dear and sacred to such personages, were threatened with utter ruin, could still remain unalarmed and inert, and be prompted into action only by the influence of British subsidies? Such a supposition was too absurd to be seriously attended to; and as to the system of the late administration, to which the noble lord so fondly referred, and seemed so anxious to bring under discussion, he could fairly say, that the inertness and folly of that administration, had formed the heaviest obstacle with which the present government had to struggle. They had never prepared any one practical means by which our allies could be assisted, or that could inspire them with the hopes of contending successfully with the common enemy. Their measures were adopted without foresight conducted without energy, and, consequently, had producer no effect. The question was then put on the address, and agreed to <i>nem. diss</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH INSURRECTION BILL.] Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for the second reading of this bill. He felt it to be a measure of great importance, and it was natural to expect he should adduce some reasons for its adoption. Measure of a similar nature had often been resorted to by the parliament of Ireland, the necessity of which had grown out of the French revolution, and the principles which the authors of it had attempted to disseminate throughout every country. Associations had at different times been entered into in that part of the empire, in which oaths wet administered, and engagements entered in to, for the worst of purposes. To counteract these practices, a bill of the nature of the present was first introduced. If such practices were dangerous then, how much more so must they be in the present state of Europe and of the empire, and when fate of Ireland was more closely linked than ever with the fate of this country; and Of the continent? He could not, under such circumstances, foresee that any material objections would be made to the bill not only because it was brought forward a milder shape than that in which the parliament of Ireland had passed it, but be-
<col>990</col>
cause it was known to have been in the contemplation of the late administration to bring forward a measure, little different from that which was now proposed, and with which, of course, the noble lords on the other side would not be much disposed to quarrel. In that hope, he should move that the bill be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland rose</member>, <membercontribution>not to oppose the principle of the bill, or perhaps even its provisions, though there were some of them which he wished to see amended, but to give it an assent, which, however, was wrung from him with sorrow, and only by he gripe of an extreme and lamentable necessity. He felt it to be a necessity not only painful to his feelings, but degrading to his character as a member of that house. How long was the imperial parliament to continue to legislate for Ireland in the spirit of this measure, that is, in defiance of the best principles of the constitution, in the blessings of which we cannot allow that unfortunate country to participate? Were these the promises&#x2014;are these the fruits of the union? But, if he was compelled to submit to the humiliation and the hardship of assenting to such a measure, the causes at least should be enquired into, which produced the dire necessity upon which alone it was attempted to be justified. These causes chiefly appeared to be, the disabilities that hung upon the Catholics in that distracted country, the pressure of the tithes, and the efforts that were systematically made to keep alive religious animosities between the Catholics and the Protestants in Ireland. On each of these causes, the noble lord descanted. He was well acquainted with the character of Irishmen, and no character did he ever see more conspicuously marked by benevolence, generosity, and courage: what, then, was it that created in that country those inextinguishable discontents which called so often for the enactment of measures like the present? It must be something of a nature the most imperious, when it urged men to forego the blessings of civilized society itself, and the advantages of a constitution such as this country boasted of and was blessed with. That was the source of the evil which we were bound to explore; and,if it was duly explored, the remedy must soon be discovered. The fact was, the great majority of the people of Ireland were deprived of the full enjoyment of the constitution, and they felt themselves injured
<image src="S1V0009P0I0518"/>
<col>991</col>
and degraded by the suspicions which gave rise to that deprivation. Englishmen loved and admired the constitution, because they enjoyed all its benefits; could it then be fairly expected that the people of Ireland should equally love and admire that constitution, from the full enjoyment of the benefits of which they were debarred? No, it was not in the nature of things; it was not in the composition of the human heart indulge them in that fair enjoyment, and their murmurs would be appeased and silenced. As to the tithes, he was happy to think that ministers meditated some measure of relief; and it so, they so far should have his most cordial support. Would that they might also be brought to discountenance the means by which religious animosities were fomented in Ireland, where, by the principles instilled by the catechisms taught in the charter schools, the infant mind of the Protestant was poisoned with prejudices against the Catholic. Yet those who encourage that system of education, accuse the Catholic of uncharitableness and intolerance#x2014;the early vices which they themselves must be conscious they are indulging against those very persons to whom they impute. But was not that the height of uncharitableness? Was it not refinement of tyranny, a tyranny that fell short of that which characterized that most accomplished of tyrants, Tiberius? In all that he had said, however, with respect to the exclusion of the Catholics from what he considered their rights, let him not be misunderstood to suppose, that it ought to be a motive on their part for disaffection much less for forming a connection with another country. He could not blame them, under that exclusion, for loving the constitution a little less than the people of this country; but although their right might be diminished, they would assuredly obtain no rights whatever, by connecting themselves with another country; they would obtain nothing but a government by the sword.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Limerick</member> <membercontribution>was sorry to hear the language and the sentiments that fell from the noble lord, for they could be productive of no good. Why eternally introduce the claims of the Catholics? why insinuate that they had reason not to love the constitution, and that at a moment when they enjoyed almost every thing the constitution could bestow? If the noble lord wised to trace the cause of the discontents in Ireland, he perhaps might find them in
<col>992</col>
this country, and trace them to such speeches as he himself had just made. He might also trace their object to the principles avowed by the leaders of the late rebellion in that country, who avowed themselves to have other objects in view than Catholic emancipation, or parliamentary reform. Against the operation of such principles it was that measures like the present must be adopted; and perhaps the more frequent enforcement of them might have prevented the spreading of disorder and the mischiefs that sprung from them. He admired much the personal character of the noble duke who was lately at the head of the Irish government; but had that noble person allowed the county of Mayo to be proclaimed during the excesses of the Threshers, the contagion would not have spread into the adjoining counties, and many persons would have escaped from the sword of justice, who, on account of that injudicious lemity, had fallen under it. So little was the real state of Ireland understood, and consequently so ill adapted the means employed to govern it!</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Bedford</member> <membercontribution>felt himself called upon to answer so serious a charge as that which the noble earl had made against him, and which amounted to nothing less than that the blood of the unfortunate people who lost their lives in consequence of the late disturbances in Ireland must rest upon his head, In reply to this, he begged leave to state, that shortly after his arrival in Ireland, he received an application, not from the county of Mayo, but from the magistrates of the county of Sligo, to proclaim martial law there; but after every attention he could give to the subject, and after taking the best counsel he could procure, he thought so severe measure unnecessary, and therefore resisted the application. He was satisfied in his own conscience, that his intentions were good. He had acted according to the best of his judgment, and he left it to the country to decide upon his conduct.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Limerick </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, observed, that he had never Said that the blood of the people who had suffered was on the head of the noble Juke. He had only stated his opinion, that if this law had been applied on the first appearance of the disturbances, the extension of the insurrection would have been prevented.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Kingston</member> <membercontribution>contended, that the magistrates in the county of Sligo were the real promoters of the disturbances. The
<image src="S1V0009P0I0519"/>
<col>993</col>
conduct of many of them was such, as to disgrace the magistracy; and some of them rather deserved to be hanged than to be made magistrates. Indeed, he knew one one of them, who had the halter round his neck, during the rebellion: and if such were the heads how could the people be brought to respect them?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Hardwicke</member> <membercontribution>was inimical to the practice of proclaiming districts where it could possibly be avoided. With respect to the bill, its necessity had been so forcibly Urged to him by persons possessing a competent knowledge of the state of Ireland, that he could not object to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Carleton</member> <membercontribution>deprecated the tendency of that line of argument which the noble lord on the opposite bench (lord Holland) had thought proper to pursue, because he, thought that argument calculated to justify the disturbances which had so long agitated Ireland. With regard to the statements of the noble lords who had lately presided over the government of Ireland, he could not admit that they should operate against this bill. For although those noble lords, in the circumstances which arose during their respective administrations, saw no necessity for acting on the law which this bill proposed to re-enact, it did not therefore follow that the bill was unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Hardwicke </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, stated, that this bill was much more obnoxious to him than the existing law, because by this bill the responsibility of those who were to execute the law was in a great measure done away in consequence of the introduction of new clauses.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member> <membercontribution>declared, that it was with the utmost reluctance he could give his assent to any such measure as that before the house; but being convinced of its necessity, he could not refuse to vote for the bill. He was convinced of the importance of conciliatory measures in Ireland, and he fully concurred in the opinion that nothing was more rare, than that a general spirit of disaffection should prevail in any country, except through the faults of the government. In Ireland, particularly, it was evident that the prevailing disaffection had proceeded from a long train of mismanagement: but this had been so long continued, and effects had become so inveterate, that it was impossible to remove the evil at once. Conciliatory measures might do much with the help of time, but their effect could only be gradual and pro-
<col>994</col>
gressive. In the mean time, we knew that a violent spirit of disaffection was widely diffused, and against the immediate pressure of this danger it was absolutely necessary to guard. Where the people were affectionately disposed towards their rulers, the slightest exertion of authority might be sufficient to maintain the execution of the law: but if we should attempt to apply the same principles of conduct to a country, where so opposite a spirit prevailed as in Ireland, the most fatal effects might ensue. Experiencing, however, the excessive danger to which we were now exposed from the disaffection of Ireland, it was of the utmost importance not to rest satisfied with the measures of severity, to which we were compelled by the immediate pressure of danger, but to look forward, and take effectual measures for obtaining a radical and fundamental cure of the evil. The objections against the measure of Catholic emancipation he was convinced were groundless, and that the danger apprehended from putting power into the hands of the Catholics was imaginary. We now, indeed, saw the Catholics a formidable political party, closely combined among themselves; but if religious distinctions had never been made a ground of civil disabilities, that combination would never have existed. If civil disabilities were imposed on every man whose name began with a P, we should immediately force the P's to become a party, they would coalesce to obtain relief, and if violently opposed, they too would become violent and dangerous. If the Catholics were placed as to every civil privilege, on the same footing as other subjects, we should soon hear as little of the Catholics as a political party, as we hear of the faction of the P's. The only plausible argument to the contrary was founded on the ambition of the Romish clergy. Undoubtedly, it must be expected that they, like every other body of dissenting clergy, would cast a longing eye on the rich benefices of the established church. But there would be little to fear from the ambition of the Roman Catholic clergy, if the laity did not make a common cause with them. The true way, therefore, to disarm this danger, was to grant to the Roman Catholic laity all their separate objects. If the civil disabilities of the Catholics were repealed, there would be no longer any community of interest between their clergy and their understand the situation of Ireland, let us bring
<image src="S1V0009P0I0520"/>
<col>995</col>
the case home to ourselves; let us suppose that the invasion of the enemy should be successful, that Our estates were to be parcelled out to French generals, that the property of every Englishman were to be abandoned as fair plunder to the French soldiery, that such of our gentry and yeomanry as should survive the ruin of their country, were forced to labour for their bread, beneath the contumelious taunts of a set of insolent foreigners, could any one believe that the people of England would soon be reconciled to their new masters, and would not eagerly grasp at any opportunity of throwing off the yoke? A long course of time might obliterate the memory of those galling circumstances, and, aided by a mild and conciliating policy, might blend the conquerors and the conquered into one people. But, if instead of a wise and conciliating policy, the intruders, giving way to their native insolence, should treat their subjects with contumely, abolish all their favourite institutions, insult their religion, and attempt to force an odious superstition upon them, seize every opportunity of marking contempt for their language and manners, and crown the whole by numerous instances of personal insult and oppression, would it be surprizing, if ages should elapse before the English nation were reconciled to their conquerors? And if such would be the feelings of Englishmen, could we wonder that the proscriptions of queen Elizabeth and James I., of Cromwell and of king William, should still excite indignation in the minds of the Irish? Among these causes of disaffection, religion had acquired an apparent Consequence which did not naturally belong to it, as it had become the badge of national distinction, and the bond of union among men, sympathizing in the same indignant feelings. But religious intolerance was so far from being the main and original cause of Irish disaffection, that, in the native dialect of the Irish, there was not a word to express the distinction of Protestant and Roman Catholic, except the national appellation of an Englishman and an Irishman. Till we were prepared to grant the demands of the Catholics, partial concessions, yielded to importunity, would only serve to keep up a spirit of restlessness, and fan the flame of discontent. The expectations which some have entertained from the measure which was brought forward by the late administration, seemed to be most extravagant. The catholics themselves disclaimed that
<col>996</col>
measure, and yet we had heard noble lords speak as if it were at once to render the Irish a united people. With respect to the general question of Catholic Emancipation, the noble earl expressed his regret that the prevailing prejudices of this country were still so strong, that there was little probability that it could now be carried. These prejudices, however, were evidently on the decline. Notwithstanding all the attempts that had lately been made to raise a cry of No Popery, that cry had had but a very partial success; and when this was compared with the events of the year 1780, it afforded decisive proof of a progress in the public mind. That progress would assuredly go on, and the time might be anticipated, when it would be as little in the power of any minister to resist the measure of Catholic emancipation, as it would now be to carry it. The Roman Catholics might safely trust their cause to the effects of this progress in the public mind: and those could not be considered as their real friends, Who should force on any premature attempt to carry through the measure before circumstances were ripe for it.&#x2014; The bill was then read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[AMERICAN INDEMNITY BILL]</member> <membercontribution>The following is a copy of the Preamble moved by lord Holland on the report of the American Indemnity bill. (see page 806.) "Whereas, by an act of parliament made in the 12th year of his late majesty king Charles II, intitled "An act for the encouraging and increasing of trade and navigation;" It is, among other things, enacted, "That no goods or commodities, whatsoever, of the growth, produce, or manufacture of Asia, Africa, or America, or any part thereof, be imported into England, Ireland, or Wales, Islands of Guernsey and Jersey, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of England or to Ireland, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, or of the lands, islands, plantations, or territories, in Asia, Africa, or America, to his majesty belonging, as the proprietors and right owners thereof."&#x2014;And whereas by an act of parliament made in the l2th year of his late majesty king Charles II. intitled, "A subsidy granted to the king, of Tonnage and Poundage, and other sums of money payable upon merchandize exported and imported," it is declared, that "No rates can be

"imposed on merchandize imported or exported by subjects or aliens, but by common consent in parliament."&#x2014;And whereas in the preamble of an act of parliament made in the reign of their late majesties king William and queen Mary; intitled, "An act declaring the Rights and Liberties of the subject, and settling the Succession of the Crown," it is among other things declared, "That the pretended power of suspending of laws, or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of parliament, is illegal, and that levying money for or to the use of the crown by pretence of prerogative without grant of parliament, for longer time, or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal." And in pursuance of the same, it is declared and enacted in the said act, "That all and singular the rights and liberties asserted and claimed in the said declaration, are the true, ancient, and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom, and shall so be esteemed, allowed, adjudged, deemed and taken to be, and that all and every the particulars aforesaid shall be firmly and strictly holden and observed, as they are expressed in the said declaration, and all officers and ministers whatsoever shall serve their majesties and their successors according to the same in all times to come."&#x2014;And whereas the navigation and commerce between the people of this kingdom and the people of the united states of America, have, or ought to have, been carried on according to law, and the customs and duties arising from the same, have, or ought to have been regulated and collected, under the authority of sundry acts of parliament made his present majesty's reign; the last of which made in the 47th of his reign, did cease and determine on the first of June last. And whereas, on the 27th of April last, his majesty was advised to prorogue the parliament then sitting and two days thereafter, without any reason or necessity, to dissolve the same by his royal proclamation, before any act had passed for legalizing the commerce and navigation between the people of this kingdom and the people of the united states of America; after the expiration of the said act, or for authorizing the collection of the duties and customs arising there from after the expiration of the same: and whereas, it would have been of material inconvenience to his majesty's government and to the people of
<col>998</col>
this kingdom, if in consequence of the said abrupt, uncalled for, and unprecedented dissolution of parliament, without any provision for the continuance of the said commerce and navigation, or for the collection of the said duties, the said commerce and navigation had been actually interrupted, or the payment of the said duties actually suspended, and therefore in the circumstances to which this kingdom had been reduced by the said abrupt dissolution of parliament, it was expedient to continue the same, though contrary to law and inconsistent with the provisions of sundry acts of parliament here in before recited. And whereas, it is expedient in order to prevent so dangerous a practice from being drawn into example, that, notwithstanding the said violations of law, particularly of the act of Charles II, Commonly called the Navigation Act, of the act made in the 12th year of the same reign, for conferring tonnage and poundage on that monarch, and of the act made in the first of William and Mary, commonly called the Bill of Rights, a bill of indemnity now be passed in favour of all persons, who, since the first of June, have been concerned in the said illicit commerce and navigation between this kingdom and the said united states of America, or in the collection of the said illicit duties and customs arising there from, or who, being bound to prevent such illicit practices, have tolerated or connived at the same."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[PROTESTS AGAINST THE AMERICAN INDEMNITY BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The following Protests were entered against the American Indemnity bill:<lb/>
"Dissentient; 1st, Because it ought to be shewn on behalf of those whom it is proposed to indemnify for a violation of the law, not only that their act was necessary to preserve the public from injury, but that this necessity was not induced by their fault. In the case on which the house has decided, the necessity was created by his majesty's ministers themselves, who advised the dissolution of the last parliament, when the consequence must evidently be, that the trade and interest of the public would suffer material injury, or that the power of the crown must be exerted against law, and in manifest derogation of the common liberty.&#x2014;2d, Because, if on the one hand, the principle of the constitution requires that the power of dissolution should reside in the crown, it is not less true, on the other, that the power of par-

<col>999</col>
liament over the public purse, and the right of the two houses, exclusively to advise his majesty in the making, repealing, suspending and altering of laws, is the proper constitutional check upon this prerogative. But if it be admitted that a dissolution of parliament is in itself sufficient to justify the continuing beyond the term fixed by parliament, and by the sole authority of the crown, the operation of any legislative provision, and particularly of an act of Supply, the power of the purse, and the legislative functions of both houses, would be virtually transferred to the crown, and all the securities which the constitution has provided for the due administration of his majesty's affairs, and for the property and liberty of the whole nation, would be utterly invalidated and destroyed.&#x2014;3d, Because at the time of the late dissolution all the measures recommended by government having been adopted, all the supplies granted, and no difference existing between the two houses, or between his majesty and his parliament, it is evident that there was no urgent political and public necessity which could warrant the exposing government to an alternative so serious and important as that which is the subject of the present proceeding."&#x2014;CARYSFORT for the two first reaons: "And moreover, because the pretences alledged for the dissolution of parliament, viz. the dismissal of the late administration, the discussions which arose upon it, and the causes which led to it were not, in my judgement, sufficient to justify those who advised so unusual an exercise of prerogative, together with a consequent breach of the law and an acknowledged invasion of the rights of the subject.&#x2014;The notion that either on the bare removal of a ministry, or in consequence of motions purporting to criminate the advisers of the crown, parliament may and ought to be dissolved, has a direct tendency to subvert the freedom of debate, to break the independent spirit of of commons house of parliament, and to render that branch of the legislature the subservient organ of the minister of the day&#x2014;Nor can any just plea for an extraordinary exercise of prerogative and manifest violation of law be founded on the measures projected by the late administration in favour of Roman Catholics and other dissenters; measures always reconcileable to the true principles of wisdom and justice, and now not only imperiously called by the exigencies of the times,

but absolutely necessary to the safety of the united empire. VASSALL HOLLAND ROSSLYN."<lb/>
"Dissentient; 1st, Because the amendment to the preamble moved upon the report was rejected by the house.&#x2014;2d, Because though a bill of Indemnity unquestionably implies that the law has been violated, and though it was admitted in debate, that nothing but necessity can possibly justify the violation of law; yet the frequency and facility with which bills of indemnity have of late years been granted, the sacred nature of the law which has in this instance been transgressed, and the circumstances which gave rise to the necessity, seemed to me to call for some more solemn declaration of the constitutional principles, which by such transgressions of the law are manifestly violated, than a simple recital of the necessity of the violation, and an immediate and unqualified indemnity for it, without reference to the events which produced that necessity, or to the peculiar nature of the illegal measure itself.&#x2014;3d, Because the principles which have in this instance been violated are so sacred and fundamental in our constitution, that at all seasons and upon all occasions, even if the ground of necessity were incontrovertibly proved, it would become the dignity of the house of lords, and would be consistent with that jealous and independent spirit, which, where the privileges of the subject are concerned, should always characterize a British parliament, scrupulously and anxiously to record, in the instrument of indulgence itself, their sense of those invaluable rights; the infringement of which nothing but an over-ruling necessity had or could have induced them to overlook.&#x2014;The right by which the subject is exempted from all taxes not granted by common consent of parliament, has at all times been deemed by sound constitutional lawyers, and has frequently been recognized by parliament itself, to be coeval with the frame and constitution of the kingdom, and has repeatedly and solemnly been declared and secured by charters of our princes and acts of our legislature.&#x2014;By the great charter of our liberties, in the reign of king John, no aid or scutage can be levied on the kingdom without the consent of the common council of the nation. By the statutum de tallagio non concedendo*, in the reign of Edward I. First, no tallage or aid can be levied by the

king without consent of the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, knights, burgesses, and freemen of the commonalty of this realm; and as in the frequent remonstrances of the parliaments of Edward III.* the jealous attachment of our ancestors to this fundamental maxim of our constitution is recorded, so in the impeachment, condemnation and punishment of the lord Latimer, which took place at the close of that reign &#x2020; their determination to enforce it is strongly exemplified: and at subsequent and later periods of our history the endeavours of our forefathers were uniformly, but more particularly in the petition of rights in 1627, and in the acts of Charles II.&#x2021; recited in the rejected preamble, directed to the solemn recognition and perpetual security of this inestimable privilege. And finally, in that solemn act of the legislature, commonly called the Bill of Rights II, the levying money without consent of parliament, and the dispensing with laws, both which practices have in this instance occurred, are declared and enacted to be illegal.&#x2014;It seemed, therefore, to me no light or trivial matter, no ordinary or indifferent proceeding, to indemnify persons for the violation of such fundamental maxims of the constitution, and prudence required a solemn and studious declaration of the great delicacy and importance of the transaction, a precaution which the frequency of such bills, and the repeated, though, perhaps, unpremeditated exertions of such illegal authority of late years, have in my judgement rendered indispensably necessary.</membercontribution></p>

not executed the purpose for which it was granted, ought now to be refunded; for he did not think that parliament should be made to pay for the fanciful notions of any set of men.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>said, that when gentlemen spoke of the sums of money that had been voted to the Sierra Leone company, they should consider that a great proportion of those sums were paid to support those men whom government must otherwise have been at the expense of supporting. The first class of those men were the blacks, who had served with the British army in the contest with America, and after that contest had been sent into Nova Scotia. Having sent a memorial to the government, complaining of the coldness of the climate to which they were sent, the government applied to the Sierra Leone company, to admit them into a colony much more congenial to their constitutions than the climate of Nova Scotia was. The company then accepted, in the first place, of nearly 1000 Nova-Scotia blacks, which government must, otherwise, have been at the expence of maintaining. Afterwards, when it became an object of policy to expel the Maroons from the island of Jamaica, government again applied to the company to take them, and they most unwillingly accepted of 5 or 6 hundred of these men. Those 1500 men, who otherwise would have been chargeable to the government, had been maintained by the company for a considerable number of years; and he hoped that it would be taken into the account, when the aids were mentioned which the company had received from government. The reason of the failure of the company in its principal objects was the continuance of the slave trade, which they had on the best ground calculated would have been abolished many years ago. Still, however, in the end, he trusted this colony would produce the happiest effects in the civilization of mankind. Like all other colonies, it had great difficulties to encounter in its outset; but he trusted it had taken deep root, and would be the means of civilizing a considerable portion of Africa. These higher objects ought not to be lost sight of Those who thought most highly of the West-India colonies ought to be the best friends of this settlement, for they must be convinced that this country owed a great debt to Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Eden</member> <membercontribution>allowed that the object of the company had in a great measure failed;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0524"/>
<col>1003</col>
but the question was, what was the cheapest Mode of maintaining the Nova-Scotians and Maroons which must be a charge or government? It would be cheaper to Maintain them where they were than to remove them to any other place. He rested his assent to the bill on that ground, for he did not expect much from the project of civilization.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>said, that if his hon. friend would consider the real circumstances of the case, he must be convinced, that if the projects of the company for promting civilization had not been more extensive, it was because the views under which they were formed had been defeated, by parliament not having sooner effected the abolition of the slave trade, and he thought it was highly unreasonable to talk of calling on the company for a reimbursement of the sums advanced to them, without at the same time giving them credit for the maintenance of the Maroons and,Nova- Scotians, entirely defrayed by them, and which otherwise must have been defrayed from the public purse.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>said, that he always conceived the sums of money advanced by government to the Sierra Leone company as done entirely with a view to conciliate the support of a certain description of gentlemen within these walls, and he thought it impossible for the committee of finance to overlook so flagrant a waste of the public money, without recommending that the reimbursement should be made by the company, which he thought should be done amongst the wealthy bankers and merchants who composed that company.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that unless the company had taken the Nova-Scotians and Maroons, the country must have paid 6,000<i>l</i>. annually for their maintenance. If, therefore, the money received by the company was to be refunded, they would be entitled to come with their bill for the maintenance of these people.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>supported the same principle, and considered the government bound to continue its protection to the black inhabitants of Sierra Leone, whom it would be the most cruel injustice to abandon, after the fidelity and attachment they had manifested to the British government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. H. Thornton</member> <membercontribution>said, that he wished the house to understand in what sense he considered the undertaking at Sierra Leone to have answered, and in what sense not to have answered; Since it Was important
<col>1004</col>
that just sentiments should be entertained in respect to the great subject of African civilization. The company had been instituted at a period, as they had imagined, of profound peace, and strong hopes had been entertained of an early abolition of the slave trade. In both these points they had been remarkably disappointed. Another great cause, however, of the disappointment of their original plans, had been the introduction of a very great and untoward body of Nova-Scotians into this colony, by whom a completely new character had been given to the undertaking. No less than 11 or 1200 colonists being received into the settlement, it had become the primary duty to provide for their maintenance and well-being, and a most heavy charge had been the consequence. The idea of establishing a considerable trade with the interior, which was one part of the original intention, had, partly through the causes which he had mentioned, and partly through a war with the natives, been relinquished; the idea of profit to the proprietors, if entertained by any of them, had vanished; the hope of making great and early progress in civilizing the surrounding natives had also been disappointed; still, however, he had the satisfaction of saying, that both the Nova-Scotians and the Maroons, amounting to 11 or 1200, had gradually improved in character, and that there now, therefore, existed a body of colonists on the coast of Africa, speaking the English language, attached to the English people, advancing in civilization and morals, and increasing in numbers, from whom, undoubtedly, and from whose children, this country might hope to derive substantial advantages, Some foundation at least had been laid, on which the government might build if they should think proper, and if circumstances should favour. The colony, as he thought, in whatever sense it might be said to have failed, had afforded proof of the practicability of civilizing Africa. What were the great impediments to the improvements of a country? Either something, first, in the climate; or, secondly, in the soil; or, thirdly, in the character of the inhabitants. The climate of Sierra Leone had now been shewn by experience to be about as good as that of other tropical countries. The soil had proved in many parts of it highly favourable to tropical produce. A very good and a new species of coffee had been found naturally to grow there, and most other articles, cultivated in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0525"/>
<col>1005</col>
the West Indies were indigenous. Natives also had been Willing to work as free labourers, and at reasonable rates. In no one of these respects was there any insuperable obstacle to civilization. This country, moreover, was expressly bound to take charge of the Maroons, and to bear the expense of providing for them, by the terms on which the Sierra Leone company had received them, and the Nova-Scotians had also some claim to consideration. Sierra Leone, indeed, now assumed nearly the same character as various other African forts to which parliament had been used to grant from 20,000<i>l</i>. to 30,000<i>l</i>. per annum. It would be, therefore, for the government to consider how many and which of the several forts they would maintain, and he believed that they would find many circumstances to favour the maintenance among others of the Sierra Leone settlement. He had himself long wished to see this colony transferred to government, having been very unwilling to come annually to parliament for the grant of a sum, of which he, as one of the directors, was to be the dispenser, and of which some gentlemen were every year questioning the propriety. The grant was now about to cease, and it would be for the parliament and the government to act hereafter as might, under all the circumstances, appear expedient.&#x2014;The bill was then passed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[COMPLAINT RESPECTING THE POOLE WRIT.] Colonel Wood</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition on behalf of W. Spurrier, who was committed into the custody of the serjeant at arms, for his conduct on the subject of the Poole Writ; stating that he had been guilty of a breach of the privilege of the house, and thereby incurred its serious displeasure; and being now fully sensible of his misconduct, most humbly begged pardon for it, and he threw himself on the mercy of the house, humbly hoping that this his contrition might be accepted, and that the house would forgive him, &amp;c. The petition being read, colonel Wood moved, that the petitioner be brought to the bar to-morrow, in order to be discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War</member> <membercontribution>called the attention of the house to the case. The petitioner had kept possession of the writ for 17 days. His son was at first a candidate, and then another in his interest, so that he had very interested motives on this occasion. He acted with a view of turning the election in favour of his family. He had no wish to prevent the lenity of the house
<col>1006</col>
being extended to this gentleman, but this was a very bad example. He trusted some provision would be made to prevent a recurrence of the offence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>agreed in the sentiments the right hon. baronet.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>thought this case more serious in its nature than that of Mr. Brundrett; the one being a mere agent, the other a sort of principal in misconduct. This gentleman stated, that he paid 30 guineas for having the writ, and that his object was only to keep it in safe custody. It was impossible to credit this assertion. There had hardly ever been so bad a case as this before the house, upon a subject of this nature, although there was one about 40 years ago something like it. He Wished a stop to be put to such practices in future. He would not oppose any lenity which gentlemen wished to shew in this instance, but the case was really a serious one.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>admitted the offence of the petitioner to be serious, but he could not help wishing that the hon. gent who spoke last had expressed his disapprobation of it when the case of Mr. Brundrett was before the house, when nothing but lenity was talked of on that side of the house. He had no objection to a parliamentary enactment to prevent such practices in future, but he saw no particular reason for being rigorous in this case.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>said, he should certainly Feel himself disposed to inflict a more severe degree of punishment both on Brundrett and Spurrier, had he not been well assured that a bill was about to be brought into parliament, that would prevent such shameful and abusive practices. It should be enacted, that as soon as the clerk of the crown had made out the writs, they Should be immediately transmitted by post to the different sheriffs, under a certain penalty.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>thought the house justified in the lenity it shewed on the last occasion when the subject was discussed, nor had he any objection to the lenity now proposed. He wished the house to proceed to the immediate adoption of some measure to prevent this mischief in future.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>admitted the impropriety of the practice in which this petitioner was concerned; but reminded the house that too many of its own members were intimately acquainted with, if not implicated in something of the same kind; but he,wished the house to stand well with the

<col>1007</col>
public, which it would never do by wreaking its vengeance on an individual, for doing only that which was well known to attach to others, and had so long passed unnoticed. If the house wished to continue in possession of the public confidence, and without it the country could not be saved, it would not be rigorous upon an individual for that sort of conduct which although reprobated in the house, was too often practised out of it. If members wished to be strict in this business, let them begin with themselves. He made these general observations from his feelings, without reference to any individual: of Mr. Spurrier he knew nothing; had never spoken to him, but he loved an impartial administration of justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Pole Carew</member> <membercontribution>cautioned the house as to attempts to remedy this evil, and reminded it of the fate of former efforts of that kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bingham</member> <membercontribution>expressed himself extremely glad at the lenity of the punishment that was inflicted on the prisoner, and the more especially, when he considered the character of that high tribunal before whom the prisoner stood; they were both the judges and the jury in the case, and they acted worthy of their high character in administering justice with mercy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lushington</member> <membercontribution>moved an amendment, that instead of the petitioner being brought up to-morrow, he should be brought up tomorrow se'nnight.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. S. Thornton</member> <membercontribution>thought this case the most extraordinary he had heard of in the course of the 24 years he had sat in parliament. He should vote for the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>thought rigour the less necessary in this case, as the house was about to provide a remedy against this evil occurring in future: for the great object of punishment was the prevention of crimes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>was disposed to vote for the more severe punishment, on account of the answer which the petitioner gave to the house yesterday; but on account of his age and infirmity, he should not oppose any lenity which might be proposed to be shewn to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lockhart</member> <membercontribution>thought the house had been somewhat remiss in not promulgating the law upon this subject, and was therefore disposed to be lenient in the present instance.&#x2014;The house then divided. For the original motion 45; for the amendment 29; majority 16.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[VACCINE INOCULATION:&#x2014;REWARD TO DR. JENNER.]</member> <membercontribution>The house having re-
<col>1008</col>
solved itself into a committee of supply,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>rose to call the attention of the committee to the Report of the Royal College of Physicians, respecting the mode discovered by Dr. Jenner, of preventing the small-pox, the severest infliction, as a disease, to which mankind was subject. Whatever might have been the origin of the discovery, it had never been known, before that gentleman made it public, that the Vaccine disease could be communicated by inoculation. If that discovery should prevent the smallpox, it was hardly possible to characterize its value in terms too strong. When the committee considered the advantages that had already resulted from it, and that would in future result from it, when the prejudice that existed against it should subside, he was sure the committee would not consider the proposition he meant to make extravagant, but liberal and just to the individual. Nothing was so difficult as to fix upon any standard, whereby to measure what should be the grant of that house upon such an occasion. The subject had been under the consideration of parliament some years since, but then there had not been time to satisfy the house of the value of the discovery, and therefore only 10,000<i>l</i>. had been voted to Dr. Jenner, instead of 20,000<i>l</i>. which his friends had proposed. The enquiry that had been recently made, was perfectly satisfactory to his mind, and consequently he proposed to move a grant of 10,000<i>l</i>. which, with the sum already granted to Dr. Jenner, would amount to the sum originally proposed by his friends to be voted to him. It was unnecessary for him to urge any more arguments in support of his proposition, to those who had read the Report. If they assumed, that the inoculation for the small-pox was a benefit to mankind, they might then be able to estimate how much greater a benefit this discovery was, which, as appeared by the report, Was a certain security against the small-pox. It appeared, that of those who had that disease naturally, one in six died, whilst of those inoculated for that disease, only one in 300 died. But of 164,381 cases of persons vaccinated, only three had died, which made the mortality only one in 54,741. It would be impossible after that statement, to represent more favourably the advantages of the discovery. And when the deaths and all the cases of inconvenience that had occurred, in that number of cases were
<image src="S1V0009P0I0527"/>
<col>1009</col>
taken together, they amounted to 179 only out of the 164,381, Which was an infinitely smaller proportion than the actual mortality by the inoculation for the small-pox. But it was not this country alone that was benefited by the discovery, the whole World participated in the advantages resulting from it. An objection might be made to the utility of the discovery, because it tended to increase population, but he should prefer the principles of practical humanity, in preserving life where it existed, to the encouragement of those checks mentioned by Mr. Malthus, whereby population might be kept down. If they were to go into a calculation of the number of lives that had been saved by the discovery, and the expence to the public spared by the diminution of the number of persons in the hospitals, they might have a mean of estimating the advantages of this important discovery. On all these grounds, he would move the committee, "That a sum, not exceeding 10,000<i>l</i>. be granted to his majesty, to be paid to doctor Edward Jenner, as a further reward for promulgating his discovery of the Vaccine Inoculation, by which a mild, efficacious, and not contagious mode of superseding that dreadful malady the Small-Pox is established; and that the same be issued and paid without any fee or other deduction whatsoever."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Shaw Lefevre</member> <membercontribution>declared it was with extreme regret he opposed the motion. He entertained for Dr. Jenner the most sincere respect, yet he could not think that this was a period for disposing of 10,000<i>l</i>. where it appeared by the Report of the college of physicians, which spewed that in 50 or 60 instances, at least, the plan had not succeeded, that, at the least, it was not infallible. The late period of the session, when so many members were necessarily out of town, was also a sufficient reason with him for withholding his approbation to the proposed motion. It had been said that Dr. Jenner had discovered the invention for which a reward was now sought to be conferred. He begged, however, to state that a similar practice had been entertained in Dorsetshire since the year 1777.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>contended, that infallibility ought not to be made the test of great discoveries, which ought rather to be estimated by general averages. He was disposed to go farther than the right hon. chancellor of the exchequer, though he should not take upon him to make any spe-
<col>1010</col>
cific proposition to the committee. There was no standard, whereby a great public discovery could be estimated, that would not enhance the value of Dr. Jenner's discovery, if tried by it. If considered with reference to the national benefits resulting from it&#x2014;to the advantages that he might have derived from his discovery, if he had not published it to the world&#x2014;to the effect it had in raising the fame, the honour, and the character of the country&#x2014;there was no standard for estimating the merit of any public discovery under which Dr. Jenner would not have a peculiar claim upon the gratitude and liberality of the house. It appeared by the Report, that the deaths by the small-pox had increased since the discovery; and though he should not wish to use any an compulsion, or to interfere with the liberty that all persons should have, to act as they thought most adviseable for their own health, or for that of their family, still he was of opinion, that persons who preferred the inoculation for the small-pox, should not be allowed to endanger the health of others. Such persons, in his opinion, ought to be confined to their houses whilst affected by the disease, and not suffered to spread infection through the community. If any proof were wanted of the value of the discovery, it would be found in the ready reception which it had met with from all nations, even the least enlightened of Asia, where prejudices were most deeply rooted. It was highly gratifying too to witness the zeal with which the gentlemen of the medical profession, not only in the metropolis, but in all parts of the country, had promoted the interests of humanity, by adopting and acting upon this important discovery.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Tarleton</member> <membercontribution>bore testimony to the value of the discovery, from the number of the military whose lives had been saved by it. It was, besides, an important circumstance, that the troops on recovery might leave their barracks, and others succeed them without any danger of infection. Military men were said to be most fond of, praising great conquerors, but, in his opinion, this gentleman who saved the lives of millions, was entitled to more praise than the most successful conqueror.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member> <membercontribution>concurred entirely with the noble lord, in the whole of what he had advanced, but most particularly so in the necessity there was for the adoption of some legislative measure, to prevent persons from bringing intentionally infectious
<image src="S1V0009P0I0528"/>
<col>1011</col>
diseases into large and populous cities and towns, which must be the case in again introducing the inoculation for the smallpox. He had been informed it was the practice of the Small-pox Hospital, to inoculate out-patients, and that those persons, so inoculated, were obliged to pass from their several lodgings and places of abode, two or three times a week, in order to be examined at the hospital, than which nothing could, in his mind, be more calculated to disseminate infection, and to spread the ravages of that dreadful and malignant disorder. He hoped, therefore, some legislative measure would soon be adopted on that subject. As to the motion now under the consideration of the committee, it had his hearty concurrence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hawkins Browne</member> <membercontribution>said, he believed his hon. friend was not correct in what he had stated as to the Small-pox Hospital. He was not prepared at the moment to Speak decisively on the subject, but he believed, though it had formerly been the practice of the Small-pox Hospital to inoculate out-door patients, they had not done so lately. He was one of the governors of that hospital, and he knew they were very favourable to the practice of vaccination. If, however, what had been stated by his hon. friend were true, it would certainly deserve the consideration of the house to put a stop to such injurious proceedings. He thought, however, there had not been sufficient notice taken of one point, viz. that this mode of inoculation Was not subject to infection, and that therefore it was not liable to the serious objections made against inoculation for the small-pox. When this Subject was formerly before the house, he had voted for the smaller sum; but he did not mean thereby to confine himself to it, in case the discovery should be found to be attended with those advantages which had since been found to result from it; and he had no doubt in his mind, but if the then chancellor of the exchequer (Mr. Pitt) were now alive, and in that high office, he would now vote for the additional sum, though he also had then opposed it. He could wish this motion to be amended by the insertion of the words, "that this mode of inoculation was not liable to infection."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member> <membercontribution>said, in answer to the last hon. gent. that he could assure the committee he was correct in what he had stated as to the Small-pox Hospital, which he shewed by a statement of their Own, by which it appeared they had inocu
<col>1012</col>
lated 2245 persons in a year. In having done this, he meant no imputation on them; on the contrary, he believed, as his hon friend who spoke last had very truly mentioned, that the governors and professors were favourable to vaccination, and he hoped they would themselves put an end to the practice of inoculating out-patients, and thereby prevent the necessity of any legislative measure as to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Morris</member> <membercontribution>said, the great merit of this discovery was, that it exterminated the disease, whereas all other modes of inoculation increased it, by being liable to infection, and it had been indisputably proved, that since inoculation there had been more deaths than before it. He thought the sum proposed was too small. Dr. Jenner had dedicated his whole time to it, and had he not succeeded, his name would have been a bye-word among the people, and among those of his own profession in particular. He thought that he deserved from the country which he had so much benefited, a sum of money that would enable him to live in a state of ease, affluence, and independence, for the remainder of his days. He should therefore propose, as an amendment, that instead of the words 10,000<i>l</i>. those of 20,000<i>l</i>. be inserted. He assured the house, that though he had spoken warmly on the subject, he was not at all acquainted with Dr. Jenner, nor any of his immediate connexions, but was actuated by a thorough conviction in his own mind that the doctor was fully entitled to this additional remuneration. The hon. and learned gent. concluded by moving his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Sebright</member> <membercontribution>most cordially seconded the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Herbert</member> <membercontribution>spoke in favour of the amendment. He said, he thought, in such a case as this, the house should have regard to what had been done in former cases of original discoveries. In that of the discovery of the longitude, they had offered 20,000<i>l</i>., and he was of opinion, that for a more extensive and more advantageous discovery, they should not think of voting a lesser sum.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>said, he was one of those who, on a former occasion, had voted for the lesser sum, because he wished, as far as they were compatible, to act at the same time on the principles of liberality and economy. An hon. gent. had said, that this differed from all other discoveries, because it came out at once matured and ripe for practice; this he believed to be truly correct, for a medical friend of his
<image src="S1V0009P0I0529"/>
<col>1013</col>
had assured him, that he had received a particular account of this discovery from Dr. Jenner 10 years before he made it known to the public; which shewed that he had not suffered himself to be hurried on by any private advantage, but had wisely deferred bringing it forward till it was in a state which was susceptible of immediate and general practice. If he had brought it out for his own private advantage., he might unquestionably have made a fortune by it; but he was above such self-interested considerations, and, from the first publication of it, he was always desirous to instruct every practitioner how to proceed with the best prospect of success. Dr. Jenner himself had never experienced any failure in his practice, though others had; but that was not to be wondered at, when it was considered what vast numbers of apothecaries and other practitioners there were throughout the country, and how very different and unequal their abilities in the profession. Dr. Jenner had thrown the discovery at once before the public, which had rapidly been conveyed to all countries, and, from the simplicity and perspicuity of the process recommended by him, in the short space of ten years, it had been spread to all parts of the habitable globe. It had made its way, and was universally adopted in Turkey, in the East Indies, and the immensely extensive territories of China; in all which it had met with the most unexampled success, and had saved the lives of millions of people in those various populous countries. If Dr. Jenner had acted thus generously and thrown himself on the liberality of the public, he ought to be rewarded; and that such reward might be commensurate to his merit, he should be for the larger sum, and support the amendment; but, if it should meet the approbation of the committee, he owned he would rather prefer a farther amendment of his own, and propose, that an annuity of 1000<i>l</i>. should be voted, in addition to the sum of 10,000<i>l</i>. in the original motion of that evening. His reason for this was, that in consequence of this discovery having become so universally known and adopted, Dr. Jenner had become a person of great fame and character abroad. No man was so much or so speedily enquired for by foreigners, on their, arrival in this country; no man more sought alter, He was, of course, under the necessity of being accessible to them; and it was impos-
<col>1014</col>
sible to be so, without incurring considerable expence. This annuity, in addition to the sum originally moved for this evening, would enable him to enjoy, through life, his country's grateful sense of the benefits derived from his labours and his talents. He had, by dedicating so much of his time to divulging his discovery in the most extensive way, lost his practice at Gloucester and at Cheltenham; and he begged gentlemen to recollect, that when this subject was formerly before the house, it had been said that Dr. Jenner would be able to compensate himself by his practice; but the contrary had actually been the fact, and he had made the practice so universally and so clearly known, that he was frequently less consulted in town than many others. Dr. Jenner generally attended his (Mr. Wilberforce's) children; but on one or two occasions, when there was thought a necessity of applying for medical assistance, and Dr. Jenner was not immediately in the way, he had instantly sent to another person, without any apprehension of his not being completely acquainted with the whole system. Under these circumstances, he would vote for the larger sum, but should prefer his own plan of an annuity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>approved highly of the system of vaccination. Although no country could give too much as a reward for such a benefit, yet there ought to be limits. In the present case, it was the misfortune of the inventor, that the extent and value of his discovery was so great, because the magnitude of that extent and value rendered it difficult to determine how much he merited. He should vote for the larger sum of 20,000<i>l</i>. and principally from taking a view of the subject totally neglected by those who had spoken before him. These right hon. members had forgotten that the tendency of the vaccine inoculation was to exterminate the small-pox completely, and thus to free mankind from the most dreadful scourge inflicted by the hand of Heaven.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>thought it material to state, that an annuity could not be voted without the previous form of a committee of the whole house, or without a message from his majesty. Under every consideration of the subject, he thought the sum originally proposed was just what ought to be voted. He commended the care taken by the Speaker to disseminate the conviction of the established authenticity of this discovery, by causing an
<image src="S1V0009P0I0530"/>
<col>1015</col>
extraordinary number of copies of the report of the college of physicians to be printed, and to be judiciously distributed through the country. He again defended the originally proposed vote, as most reasonable and proper.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>thought, that in order to constitute the grant or reward, the expences Dr. Jenner had been at ought to be previously paid. Dr. Jenner could prove, that he had expended more than the original sum voted to him, in propagating the discovery, before the vote had passed. He cited from a Madrid gazette of October last, an account of the honours done to a medical person, sent to communicate the vaccine inoculation in all the foreign possessions of Spain, upon his return from his mission. He cited reports from various parts of the world, stating the success of vaccination, particularly in our Indian possessions. He trusted that under these circumstances, the larger reward would be voted.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>maintained the propriety of voting the larger sum. He was the more particularly interested in recommending this discovery to remuneration, as it had contributed infinitely to the relief of the poor, in whose cause he was now particularly engaged. If this opportunity of conferring an adequate reward should be passed by, it would never return.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Fuller</member> <membercontribution>also supported the enlarged motion. He thought something ought to be done to prevent inoculation for the small-pox, otherwise the discovery would not have its full effect.<lb/>

<p><member>[POOR RELIEF BILL.] Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for going into a committee on the poor's Relief bill.&#x2014; On the clause relating to Settlement, a conversation took place between Mr. Morris, Mr. Whitbread, Mr. Fuller, Mr. Calvert, Mr. Giddy, Mr. W. Smith, Mr. Pole Carew, Mr. Rose, Mr. S. Bourne, and the Solicitor-General.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. S. Bourne</member> <membercontribution>proposed that the blank should be filled up with the words "ten years," instead Of "five."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>was willing to admit the introduction of "seven years."&#x2014;A division ensued; for the ten years 32, against it 25: majority 7.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1016</col>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>moved for the admission into the clause of a proviso that it should not extend to Norwich.<lb/>
After some observation by Mr. Whitbread, this motion was negatived without a division.&#x2014;A long discussion then took place on the question, "that the above clause so amended, stand part of the bill;" which terminated in a division: For the clause 23; against it 30; majority 7.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>then declared his intention of abandoning the bill for the present session, and the chairman left the chair.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[EAST-INDIA COMPANY'S BONDS BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion for the third reading of this bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Creevey</member> <membercontribution>said, when he formerly expressed a wish that the further progress in this bill should be postponed, he did so because the necessary accounts were not then all on the table. They had since been produced, and they were by no means calculated to satisfy him, that the company had any prospect of being able to produce a revenue which should at any time greatly exceed their expenditure, or such as would enable them to provide for the payment of these Bonds. It appeared to him, that there was even on the accounts 1805&#x2013;6, a deficiency of 2,000,000<i>l</i>. He had heard an hon. member, a director of the company, (Mr. Grant) talk of a residue of nearly 1,000,000<i>l</i>. He saw, indeed, on looking into the accounts, a balance in one place of 600,000<i>l</i>. but in this view of the case, the interest of the debts due by the company were not provided for. Calculating on this and the other expences, there was a deficiency for the year 1805&#x2013;6 of nearly two millions, and for the preceding year of 1,600,000<i>l</i>. He was therefore more than ever confirmed in the opinion, that there was an impossibility in supposing that the company could ever have a net surplus revenue, or should ever be able to provide for their debts abroad and at home. As, however, it was admitted by the hon. director and by the chancellor of the exchequer, that no claim could lie against the
<col>1018</col>
public on account of the bonds now to be issued, or any other debts of the company; and as it was understood that an enquiry into the state of the company's affairs was to take place early in the next session, if the East-India company could borrow money in the way proposed, he should not object to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>contended, that by properly analysing the accounts on the table, the hon. member would have found that the accounts for 1805&#x2013;6, instead of a deficiency, produced a surplus of 800,000<i>l</i>.; and by a necessary attention to the expenditure, he had no doubt it would produce such a surplus as would be sufficient for a speedy liquidation of their debts.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>declared, from all the attention he had been able to pay to the subject, that the deduction drawn by his hon. friend (Mr. Creevey), not that of the right hon. gent. opposite, was correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Tarleton</member> <membercontribution>said, he had it in charge from his constituents to oppose the bill; and particularly to oppose the renewal of the company's exclusive 'charter; which, when it came before the house, he should feel it his duty to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>thought that the weight of testimony was at present against the company. If, however, an hon. member of the board of controul (Mr. Johnstone), whom he now saw in his place, would join his testimony to that of the gentleman at the head of the board, as to the state of the company's affairs, and the probability of a favourable issue, he should be satisfied; at least it would go far to make him credit the statement of the right hon. gent.(Mr. R. Dundas.)&#x2014;The bill was then read a third time. On the question that the bill do pass, Mr. W. said, that observing the hon. gent. to whom he alluded, had preserved a determined silence, he must object to the passing of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>felt himself extremely flattered by the appeal made to him by the hon. gent. opposite. Gentlemen, however, would recollect that he had always been impressed with a gloomy opinion on this subject. He confessed he did not at this moment look to the future situation of the company with a sanguine eye. By prudence and economy, he thought much might be done; but the company ought not, and could not, expect a great additional revenue. As much was already drawn from their territories, as could be expected. It was therefore to economy
<image src="S1V0009P0I0532"/>
<col>1019</col>
principally they were to look for a change in their affairs. As to the support to be given to the inclination of his constituents, ten years hence, by the hon. general (Tarleton), he could only say, he hoped the hon. general would, at the expiration of that period, continue their representative. But at the same time, he had no hesitation in declaring it to be his fixed opinion, that the preservation of our empire in that quarter of the globe depended on the preservation of the company.<lb/>
The following will be found a more correct report of the Speech of Mr. Grant, on the second reading of this bill, than the one given at p. 833.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grant,</member> <membercontribution>in reply to Mr. Creevey, said he had often, when Indian subjects were before the house, expressed his readiness to go into a full investigation of those subjects, and of the company's affairs, provided only that the investigation were to be conducted not by party prejudice, but with fairness and impartiality. No subjects more required to be treated dispassionately and without aggravation. To consider them in any other way, must be productive of mischief, rather than of benefit, yet he was sorry to observe that the hon. gent. (Mr. Creevey) had indulged himself in statements which appeared chargeable with exaggeration, and to be in some points the result rather of ignorance than of knowledge. With respect to the desire shewn of passing this bill through the house, before the accounts of the Indian budget could come under consideration, it arose merely from an expectation that the session would be a very short one. The Indian accounts of the two last years had not been long in the possession of the court of directors, and the hon. gent. himself ought to know from experience, the difficulty of such an arrangement of those numerous documents as should put them in a fit state for the consideration of the house. The fact was, that with all the diligence that could be exerted, it was found impracticable to place them on the table in a printed state, before the time at which it was necessary to proceed with the present bill. The papers of the first year he hoped would be laid before the house today, those of the second were in a state of forwardness, and would follow in a few days; but if this bill were to wait for the discussion of them, the object proposed by it might be defeated. There were besides, documents already before the house, which sufficiently shewed the ground of the pre-
<col>1020</col>
sent application of the company to parliament. The prospective account of these home receipts and payments, from March 1807 to March 1808, laid before the house last session, shewed a deficit of about 2,200,000<i>l</i>. It was to provide for this deficit that the company applied, not for any grant of money, as might be misconceived from the hon. gentleman's mode of speaking, but for leave to issue bonds to the amount of two millions, instead of raising that sum by an increase of their capital stock, to which stock they had already a power from parliament to add two millions, equivalent to nearly four millions sterling. But though they possessed this power since the year 1797, they had declined, and still wished to decline using it, because during war stock must be funded to a disadvantage and therefore money procured in this way would cost them a higher rate of interest than they would pay on their bonds, besides entailing on their affairs an additional amount of capital, of which they could not hereafter divest themselves, whereas they could pay off their bonds whenever it suited their affairs. And this also furnished an argument against the hon. gent.'s reasoning, because bonds could only obtain a loan during the pleasure of the holders, who might claim payment whenever they thought fit. This was therefore a case different from any of the former applications of the company, alluded to by the hon. gent.,&#x2014;for the company here asked for no extension of credit, they asked merely to be allowed to raise by bond part of that sum which they already possessed a power to raise by stock, and which they could now raise by stock, if they thought fit. The hon. gent. had endeavoured to shew that this power to raise more stock had been given to the to company as a commutation for raising more money by bonds, which according to him they were unable to do, even when the issue of bonds was under two millions; but here he was entirely mistaken, for the application of the company for that power to increase the stock, appeared from the journals to have been made on this general ground, "that the affairs of the petitioners required a permanent advance of a considerable sum of money beyond what they could raise under the powers then vested in them by law, and the petitioners conceived that the money so wanted by them should be raised by an increase of the capital stock." The company, moreover,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0533"/>
<col>1021</col>
as would be seen by their annual accounts, were empowered and able to raise 3 millions by bonds. The hon. gentlemen had stated that the estimate for 1807&#x2013;8, shewed a loss by their commerce of above two millions. This was a very gross error. There was no loss on their commerce, but a gain. The account was not a statement of profit and loss, but a prospective estimate of expenditure, and of ways and means for the ensuing year. The deficit it exhibited determined nothing as to the general result of the company's affairs; only the expected receipts and expected payments in one year. And the deficit arose not from their commerce, but from the remittance of large supplies of goods and bullion in three successive years, 1803, 4, and 5, to India, for the purposes of investment and liquidation of debt, which remittances had been applied in a great degree to defray the expences of the wars in which the company had come to be involved in India, without their orders, and contrary to their wishes. On account of these wars too, the returns of investment from India were less than usual, and from the state of the continent of Europe, had come to a worse market than usual, the company's warehouses being now stocked with goods, for which if there had been a ready sale, time enough to meet their exigencies, the present application for power to raise money by bonds, might not have been necessary. With respect to that part of the Indian debt which the hon. gent. called a floating debt, and by which it appeared he meant the part claimable in England, or the decennial and optional loans, though it was undoubtedly a very serious consideration, it could not come suddenly and all at once upon the company. The first of the decennial loans was two millions, and not due till 1810. The optional loans bearing the large interest of India and not being transferable to England at a high rate of exchange, were not likely to be transferred thither in a mass, and before there was a provision made for their payment. At the same time, nobody contended that it was not of the greatest importance to the company, that some plan should be adopted for the liquidation of the Indian debt, though it was not then the moment to enter into that subject. The debt was enormous, and the great difficulty with which the company had to struggle.&#x2014;But it had not attained its present alarming height by measures for which the directors were
<col>1022</col>
responsible. As to the failure of expectations, formerly held out by a noble lord at the head of the Indian department, it was fair to the company to say that those expectations were stated to be on the supposition of a permanent peace, and were defeated by the long European war which followed the French revolution, and by successive wars in India, all which had entailed prodigious expences on the company both at home and abroad. The return of peace in India however, certainly afforded hope that the present embarrassments of the company would be but temporary; for considerable retrenchments in the expenditure were now going on in India under the administration of sir George Barlow (whose conduct in adopting the pacific system of lord Cornwallis, after having before acquiesced in the foreign policy of lord Wellesley, Mr. Grant defended against the observations of Mr. Creevey) and the advices from thence held out the expectation of a surplus of revenue after defraying all charges and the interest of the debt. That the peace of India would be permanent, Mr. Grant said he had not taken upon him to assert. He had spoken of what might be hoped for if peace continued; and as to its continuance, though undoubtedly the native powers must have been greatly alienated from us by the course of policy and war which the British government had recently pursued there, and they might then be far more ready, under new and encouraging circumstances, to act against us, yet at present they shewed no disposition to break with us, and were indeed reduced in means. We also had professedly resumed a pacific system, and our manifesting a determination to persevere in it might have a tendency to conciliate them.&#x2014;Dr. Laurence having in his speech insinuated that Mr. Grant had inconsistently departed from the language held in the third report of the directors, and the opinions he had given in that house respecting the measures of lord Wellesley, Mr. Grant replied that he was no party to the third report, not having concurred in it nor having been a member of the court when it was brought forward; and as to the late measures in India, when they came to be discussed, it would be found he had not uttered his sentiments regarding them.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1023</col>
question for the third reading of this bill, a number of amendments, similar to those offered in the house of commons, were proposed by lord Holland, earl Fitzwilliam, and the duke of Bedford. After much discussion, they were all negatived.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Bedford</member> <membercontribution>moved to limit the duration of the bill to one year and two months, after the commencement of the then next session of parliament, instead of two years and six months after the commencement of the then next session of parliament, as expressed in the bill. The noble duke thought that a bill conferring such extraordinary powers should have as short a duration as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>thought, that the knowledge that such a bill existed, and that the powers conferred by it might be called into action, would do much to repress and keep down a spirit of disturbance. With this view of the subject, regretting as he did, the necessity that existed for such a measure, he still thought that the longer period was preferable; nor did he see any reason to expect that the causes which produced the necessity for this bill would cease to operate within the shorter period proposed by the noble duke.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member>, <membercontribution>viewing as he did the state of Ireland, and with the sentiments which he had constantly avowed with respect to the causes of that unfortunate situation of affairs in Ireland which led to the necessity for the present bill, could not help pressing upon the attention of their lordships the great importance of discussing the affairs of Ireland in parliament, and of endeavouring to come to those conclusions which might, by removing the causes of grievance, prevent the necessity of recurring to such measures as the present. He could not, therefore, but be a warm friend to frequent discussions of this subject. He thought that every opportunity should be taken of recurring to it, and therefore he supported the amendment moved by his noble friend, in order that this important subject might again come under the consideration of parliament at an earlier period than it otherwise could do, according to the term of duration expressed in the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Duke of Montrose</member> <membercontribution>deprecated frequent discussions of this subject, which could do no possible good, but on the contrary, only tended to keep up a spirit of irritation amongst the people of Ireland. Instead of shortening the duration of the
<col>1024</col>
bill, he, on the contrary, would have voted for extending it. Parliament always having the power of repealing it if the necessity which now existed for it should cease.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>was inimical to giving a long duration to bills of this nature, but from the situation of Ireland, he believed the term of duration, expressed in this bill, to be necessary.

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-07-31">Friday, July 31.</date>
<p><member>[IRISH PROTESTANT CHURCH.] Sir J. Newport</member> <membercontribution>enquired if any step was intended to be taken by his majesty's ministers, founded on the returns which had been made of the state of the established church in Ireland? He had the authority of the primate and metropolitan of all Ireland, for stating that there were, in one diocese, no less than 10 parishes without a church, without a glebe-house, without, in short, any sort of residence for the clertyman, and without any probability that there would shortly be any dwelling erected for that purpose. It was known that his majesty's late ministers had entered into a serious consideration of those circumstances; and, if he was not given to understand that the present ministers intended to make some material alteration in that respect, he gave notice that he would, early in the next sessions, submit to parliament, a proposition on that head.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>assured the right hon. baronet, that it was the intention of his majesty's present servants to turn their attention to the state of the church in Ireland, as soon as they had before them such documents as might authorize them to take any step towards the accomplishment of so desirable an object. At present, however, he had not in his hands such returns as he thought necessary, previous to his endeavour to remedy the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0535"/>
<col>1025</col>
evil of which the right hon. baronet complained.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[STATE OF IRELAND.] Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>gave notice, that he would, on Friday next, submit to the house a motion relative to the general State of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>expressed a desire to be informed, what was the particular object which the right hon. gent. had in contemplation? It might for the present suffice if the right hon. gent. would state, whether his attention was meant to be directed towards the civil, ecclesiastical, or military state of that part of the united kingdom, as by that means he might be prepared to meet the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that he had not the least unwillingness to satisfy the right hon. gent. as far as the rules of the house would permit him at present. His intent was to submit to the house the proposition of a strong pledge, that they would, early in the next session, enter into an enquiry as to the causes of that discontent which was said to exist in Ireland, and upon the rumour of which the house had been induced to adopt that strong measure, the Irish Insurrection act, which would shortly, no doubt, receive the sanction of both houses of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[SUBSIDIES TO PRUSSIA AND SWEDEN, &amp;c.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion of the chancellor of the exchequer, the house resolved itself into a committee of supply, to which his majesty's messages, and several other papers, were referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member>, <membercontribution>in moving the house to grant the sums which were the subject of his majesty's messages, should content himself with stating shortly, that the first sum of 80,000<i>l</i>. was the same which had already been made the subject of a communication from his majesty in March last, and which had been suffered to lie over without being made good, in order that an opportunity might be afforded of a fuller view of what should be necessary to be proposed. The message he had brought down the other day, divided itself into two parts. One, the measure of subsidizing an increased number of Swedish troops; the other, the advance to Prussia, and the proposed treaty of subsidy with that power. The arrangement with Sweden, though it was thought a fact proper to be communicated to parliament, and though payments might come to be made upon it, yet as none had yet been made, and as no vote was to be called for this night, he should
<col>1026</col>
not enter into further than to state, that, in May last, in consequence of a determination to make a concerted effort with the aid of Prussia, Russia, and such assistance as could be afforded from this country, it was thought adviseable to push the exertions of Sweden as far as the resources of that country would afford. Previous to that time, while there was no appearance of any service being rendered in that quarter by the power of Sweden alone, no augmentation of the Swedish troops was thought of. But when the king of Prussia agreed to furnish 10,000 men to act in Pomerania, when a Russian detachment also was expected in that quarter, and when it was in contemplation to send a force from this country, an arrangement was made for bringing into action a Swedish force of 16,000 men instead of 12,000 before employed. The additional 4000 men were to be furnished at rather a cheaper rate than the terms of the former subsidy. As no money had yet been paid, in consequence of this addition, and as the utmost that could become payable in this year could be no more than 40 or 50,000<i>l</i>. which would be fully covered by the vote of credit passed according to custom, he did not think it necessary to look further into this point, being prepared to give any explanation that might be demanded. With regard to the advances to Prussia, in consequence of the urgency of affairs on the continent, the advances in money, notwithstanding they might be authorized by the message in March, would not have been made if the exigency of the case could have admitted of waiting, for the conclusion of the treaty then in contemplation. When the treaty was made, however, it was stipulated that the two sums of 80,000<i>l</i>. and 100,000<i>l</i>. should be deducted from the first payment of the subsidy, and the amount of the arms from the future payments. Unquestionably, the objects of the treaty were of a large extent, and the subsidy of a large amount, if the contingencies on which it was to take effect had happened, and if the events that had arisen had not put an end to the engagements, and left us the charge of making good these advances. The arms had been supplied from the offices to which that charge belonged, and the expence when made out, would be covered by the vote of credit; all that would be necessary therefore for the house to vote, would be the sums advanced to his Prussian majesty, on account of the urgency of affairs
<image src="S1V0009P0I0536"/>
<col>1027</col>
on the continent; which be moved accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the motion. The first advance had been made by the government to which he had the honour to belong. While these advances were intrusted to the management of such safe hands as those of lord Hutchinson, the public might rely with confidence on having its interests fully guarded; for, along with the military enterprize that belonged in so high a degree to that distinguished person, there were blended in his character a caution and a prudence which afforded a perfect assurance of the safe and judicious exercise of the discretion reposed in him. With respect to the additional engagements with Sweden, he had no objection to them, if they could be brought to answer any purpose of practical utility. But when these engagements should come to be made the ground of a vote, it would be proper to enquire how far there existed the means of carrying them into effect on the part of his Swedish majesty, who, he understood, had not completed the first force of 12,000 he had stipulated to employ in Pomerania.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>assured the noble lord, that at the time of concluding the additional engagement, the force serving at Stralsund exceeded the 12,000 men stipulated in the other treaty.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>wished to know, whether the stipulations of the treaty with Prussia would be laid before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Canning</member> <membercontribution>said, he did not see how such a communication could with propriety be made by his majesty's ministers. If, however, the hon. gent. wished particularly for information on the subject, he might move for it, and the house would then determine whether it ought to be granted. For his own part he regretted, as much as the hon. gent., that the treaties could not with propriety be laid open, for he wished the conduct of the present government to be enquired into. They were well convinced of the propriety and policy of their measures, and proud of what they had done. In both instances the advances been made in cases of great and pressing emergency, and formed only a small part of the subsidy which was to have been paid in consequence of the treaties, had they been completed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>considered it as very important, that every means should be of forded of judging of the continental policy, for which his majesty's ministers promised
<col>1028</col>
so largely, and in which they were ready to pledge the country so deeply. For it was stated expressly, that the 10,000<i>l</i>. advanced, was part of a much larger sum, which would have been to be paid if the treaty had taken place. This led to the question of the policy of making so large an engagement. Knowing the situation in which the king of Prussia was at the time when the arrangement was made, it was matter of desire to know what were the particulars of the arrangement. It might, perhaps, be possible to frame a motion so as to get at the treaty, or at least the substance of it. By considering the policy of what ministers had done in framing that treaty, it would be possible to judge of the policy of what they would have done if a larger opportunity had been afforded to them, and of their general views and general policy with respect to the continent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>was still of opinion, that the treaty itself could not possibly be laid before the house; but it was competent to the hon. gent. to frame a motion for any information he might wish for; the house would exercise its discretion as to the propriety of granting such information, and in the discussion the hon. member would have an opportunity of knowing, and commenting upon much of the continental policy of his majesty's servants. He could assure him that there was no shyness on his part, or that of his colleagues; to submit their conduct to the judgment and investigation of the house, and they challenged that investigation with as full confidence as those who had preceded them. If the hon. gent. felt any jealousy at this time in particular, let him call for any information he wished for. The vote now before the committee rested on the some ground as the advance made by the late government in March. The only difference was, that the advance then made was specific, and distinct in itself; while the subsequent advance was made in prospect of a subsidy, from which, if this treaty had taken effect, it would have been deducted. This advance might have been stated to the house as a distinct thing, like the other; but his majesty's government thought it better to profess the whole truth without disguise. He lamented, that invincible impediments of form prevented the house from having the treaty before it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>was ready to admit that the right hon. gent. and his colleagues, acted from the best view they had of what
<image src="S1V0009P0I0537"/>
<col>1029</col>
was a proper course of continental policy; and therefore he could suppose them very ready to give every explanation that could be required of them. It had been stated on a former occasion, by a noble friend of his, now absent (lord Howick), that though the advance of 80,000<i>l</i>. had been made for the particular purpose of providing for the defence of Silesia, which it was politic to provide for at the time, yet that there was no intention of entering into any engagement of subsidy, and that none would be entered into without that caution which past experience had shewn to be so necessary for the protection of the public interest. This 100,000<i>l</i>. was, in fact, part of a million which was to have been paid to Prussia, if the campaign had gone on. The house, which had voted away much larger sum for subsidies within the last 14 years, with so little benefit, ought to be particularly jealous of any considerable expence on that head now. His noble friend, now absent had decidedly disclaimed the policy of inviting the continental powers, by the temptation of subsidies, to enter into wars in which they were not previously disposed to engage; but finding them engaged in a war for objects that concerned the common interest, the policy of assisting them with subsidies, granted on sure grounds and with good discretion, would lie open. But the first consideration in granting a subsidy was, what was to be got in return, and what possible means had the king of Prussia, at the time this treaty was entered into, to perform any service adequate to the million he was to receive? Was it not physically impossible that he could bring into action a force proportionate to it? It was rumoured, moreover, he knew not on what authority, that the sum that had already been paid to Prussia in the prospect of this subsidiary service, had been expended for purposes to which this country Would not willingly contribute a single shilling, for the purpose of maintaining certain establishments at Berlin, with the expences of which Bonaparte charged the king of Prussia, and for which those about that monarch had engaged him to pay. If the king of Prussia was in a situation to submit to have money extorted from him by the emperor of France, that certainly was not a time at which this country ought to advance money to the king of Prussia. He thought it would be possible to frame an address to his majesty, so as to cause the treaty to be laid before the house. Next, with respect to the engagements
<col>1030</col>
with Sweden, it was said that his Swedish majesty had not so many troops as his first subsidy bound him to furnish; he was glad to hear from the right hon. gent. what he had; but the means and the utility of making the augmentation were still uncertain.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member>, <membercontribution>though he could not say he was prepared to second an motion the hon, gent. might make with view to obtain information, was yet willing to give him every possible facility with respect to the object he had in view. The advance of 100,000<i>l</i>. would not have been made, except in the prospect of the contingency on which the treaty turned, nor till the exigency became so pressing, that it came to the alternative, whether the king of Prussia would be able to make a further struggle or not. With respect to the security of the due application of the money to services not foreign to British interests, the advance was made when the removal of the ministers devoted to the French government, and the appointment of baron Hardenberg to the head of the Prussian cabinet, afforded a sufficient guarantee. As long as there was reason to suppose that any sums saved from the wreck of the Prussian treasures at Berlin, remained unexhausted; as long as there was room to suspect that any sums at the disposal of the Prussian government were applied to any purposes inconsistent with British objects; so long all advances had been withheld. It was not till all these objections had been removed, that British liberality had been extended. He had further to assure the house, that till the very end of the campaign, the king of Prussia had had a considerable effective force, which lord Hutchinson stated to be most vigorously and effectively employed. Whatever might have been the result of this unfortunate campaign, it was at least a consolation to this country, that its aid had been twice the means of saving the gallant garrison of Colberg, which had held out to the end of the conflict, and which now stood with undiminished honour among the subjugated cities around.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>wished to know whether lord Hutchinson was a party to the treaty of subsidy. He wished also, as it had been said by some of the gentlemen on another day, that the situation of the continent had come upon them unexpectedly; he wished to know, whether they had not received from lord Hutchinson information, the effect of which was to prognosti-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0538"/>
<col>1031</col>
cate the events that had taken place. With the proximity of Russia to her frontier, pushed as she was close up to it, her means of recruiting must be so convenient, that the aid she could derive from them could not fail to be distinctly visible. It in this situation Russia was not able to stand a general battle, her failure must be obvious, Now, did the right hon. gent. opposite receive such assurances of the unbroken strength of Russia as to justify them in delaying, as they had stated that as the ground of the delay in bringing forward the measures they now urged, as essentially necessary to the defence of the country?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>would not decline answering the hon. gent.'s question, on the ground that it had no reference to the matter in debate. Lord Hutchinson had certainly always given reason to expect, that unless certain things should be done, it was likely that a general battle, if given, would be lost. It was possible, however, that a general battle might be avoided, as the obvious and avowed policy was to avoid it. Another contingency was the arrival of Military aid from Britain. The first communication the present ministers had received on entering into Office, conveyed the expectation of that aid: whether the expectation was authorized, he knew not; but the aid was expected, and no preparation was made to afford it either by descent in a certain point, or by diversion. But instead of having made any preparations to contribute in either way, the whole of the transports in foreign service had been dismissed some time before the change of administrtaion. The other contingency put by lord Hutchinson was, that unless Prussia should be supported by military as well as pecuniary aid, it would be impossible to go on. Lord Hutchinson's naked opinion was certainly discouraging. But, taking the chance of its being possible to avoid a general battle, and of supporting with pecuniary and military aid the efforts that remained to be made, there was still room to hope for a different issue: his majesty's government immediately supplied pecuniary aid to the extent which it thought right, and was prepared to afford military aid as far as that should be possible. He was sorry to have been compelled to go so far into this discussion in the absence of a noble lord (Howick), in the hope of whose presence the consideration of his majesty's message
<col>1032</col>
had been deferred till this day; but the discussion had been rendered indispensable to his own vindication, and if it had turned out injurious to those whose interests the hon. gent. had particularly at heart, he was not to be blamed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>did not conceive that the reputation of the noble lord, for whom he was particularly interested, was at all brought into hazard by the discussion that had arisen: but even if it were, the superior importance to the country, of bringing forth the explanations that were so essentially necessary, would have been a prior consideration with him. It was allowed, that lord Hutchinson held forth but a discouraging prospect of the issue of the last campaign. But the right hon. gent. hedged in some contingencies which might have retarded or retrieved the otherwise inevitable disaster. One thing, however, was sufficient to prove that there was no hope to be entertained from Russia. Driven back as she was to her frontier, if she felt still under a necessity of avoiding a general engagement, her case was absolutely hopeless. If there were from the beginning, persons who entertained hopes of success, where he confessed he saw no prospect, exaggerated as every little advantage on the side of Russia was, and extenuated as were the successes of France; if in such a situation, no prospect of success was seen, except in avoiding a general engagement, all hope was gone. Then, it was said that lord Hutchinson had intimated, that there was an impression that British aid would be afforded on the continent. He asked the right hon. gent. whether, when the contest broke out between France and Prussia, the latter was not at war with Great Britain for Hanover, which she refused to give up, except it should be wrested from her by force of arms. This was in November. Then, what possibility was there, even if it should be expedient to send a British force, to dispatch that force before the change in administration? He for one thought it inexpedient to send a British force. For,if Russia, drawn to her frontiers, could not make a stand there, no possible aid that British troops could give, would avail. The right hon. gent. then said, that when the present ministers came into office they found no means of carrying their views of continental co-operation into effect. They came into office in April, when they immediately felt the necessity of sending military aid to Prussia, and of increasing the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0539"/>
<col>1033</col>
Swedish subsidy. It was not till the middle of June, however, that they had collected transports, and even then they were collected for a different service. Now, they had embarked upwards of 28,000 men in a fortnight. If that could be done in July, why might it not have been done in April? When the urgency of the occasion was felt from the outset, why was not the aid prompt in proportion? He saw a great military character (general Tarleton) on the opposite benches, and he should be glad to hear what he called his military ideas on this point. If the preparations, the want of which was now complained of, had been kept up, 40,000<i>l</i>. a month would have continued to be paid for transports, and the expedition would not have sailed sooner; whereas it was now found that when troops were ready, transports could be collected at a moment's warning. This went to justify the late administration, as far as facts could go.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>said, the hon, gent. had touched on points which would render it necessary for him to go more at length into the subject in debate, than he should otherwise have been disposed to do. The hon. gent. in the independent comments which he was very properly in the habit of exercising, had on this occasion glanced on matters, the consideration of which could not be very favourable to his right hon friends. He denied that by the mere accident of being at war with Prussia at the time the government of this country was justified in omitting to prepare to wart off the blow, which sound policy would never warrant it in suffering to fall upon Prussia. During the whole period in which the late ministers had suffered themselves to be made dupes at Paris, in negociations in which all the principles that ought to characterize statesmen were belied and adandoned, it was matter of notoriety, even to persons out of the government, that, though Prussia was nominally at war with this country (for it was never more than a nominal war), there were discussions of so angry a nature, that it was probable it would involve these two power in a war, in which Russia also would eventually participate. Under these circumstances the policy that should have marked the conduct of a wise British government was obvious: but the very reverse was exhibited in the conduct of the late government. Instead of being prepared to act for the best advantage upon the opportu-
<col>1034</col>
nity about to be afforded, the late ministers suffered themselves to be duped and cajoled at Paris, even for a long time after the commencement of hostile proceedings between France and Prussia. This, then, was one of the brilliant &#x00E6;ras selected to do honour to the late ministers; when the military power of Prussia was about to be crushed, after so many other powers had been crushed before it, no means were prepared to avert or repel the impending fate, no thought seemed to be entertained of interposing to avert it. Then these ministers, who held themselves justified in giving no aid at all, accused him and his colleagues of giving their aid too late. He had also to state, that Prussia, at the time of the formation of this treaty of subsidy, was not so impotent as it was thought by some. In the battle of Eylau, when France felt herself engaged with an enemy so different from any she had hitherto encountered, the Prussian corps, under general Lestocq, had been vigorously engaged, and had materially contributed to the fortunate issue of the day. When the treaty was concluded, the Prussian force, including the garrisons in Silesia, the new levies waiting for the arms some time before dispatched from this country, and the 10,000 men which were to act at Stralsund, amounted to no less than 90,000 men. Thus, however reduced, the great military power of Prussia afforded yet a great remnant, which it was highly politic in us to maintain and uphold. With respect to the military aid expected from this country, the late ministers should have taken care not to suffer such an expectation to be held out or formed; but lord Hutchinson stated that expectation so strongly, that unless the present ministers were disposed to commit what would be nothing short of a breach of faith, they could not avoid sending the aid so expected. When he and his colleagues came into office, however, they found no means whatever of conveying that aid. It was whimsical enough, that while the aid expected by the king of Sweden was looked for entirely in cavalry, and the excellence of the British cavalry rendered it naturally desirable where cavalry. could act, there was not a single arrangement to transport that cavalry. There was but one cavalry transport engaged, as it were for a curiosity, or in order that there might be always a model of a cavalry transport in the service. The first dispatch that had been received by the present mi-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0540"/>
<col>1035</col>
nisters, expressed great disappointment that the cavalry had not arrived; and yet, any person who knew the difficulty of providing cavalry transports, besides the time and trouble of fitting up, must be sensible, that unless a supply had been left by their predecessors, the present ministers could not send off the aid sooner. He could easily make it appear, that the total discharge of transports, except those necessary for home service, was far from being a saving of 40,000<i>l</i>. a month. Motives of economy might be the reason of having no supply of transports. The total dismantling of that department might have been contrived to fall in with the plan of finance of the noble lord (H. Petty), which proceeded throughout on fallacious data, being built upon the supposition of a continued war expenditure of 32 million, when the war expenditure was, in fact, in no one year so little. This was a false economy, leading evidently to great and not distant profuseness, accompanied with much greater mischief. An order had been sent by the late government to the transport office, to pay off all the transports then engaged. This produced a representation of the great expence that would attend making good all the contracts, to the expiration of the terms of engagement, when in a few days it would be necessary to take up other transports for the public service. The mandate of dismissal came from the treasury, though the transport office properly was under the secretary for the war department, the right hon. secretary (Mr. Windham) was therefore not to blame for the order, which coming from the treasury was probably intended to promote the objects of the grand plan of finance to which he had already alluded. The order was executed so far as to dismiss all transports but those necessary to the communication between G. Britain and Ireland, and Guernsey and Jersey. The saving made did not amount to 40,000<i>l</i>. but only to 4,000<i>l</i>. a Month; and after the quantity of transport tonnage sent abroad on the distant expedition of the right hon. gent. there ought to have been an increase rather than a diminution. Government had received 60,000 tons of transports from its predecessors. If the late ministers did not mean to abandon all connection with the continent, they ought to have kept up a sufficient supply of tonnage. Then as to the question, why the present expedition was not dispatched in May, rather than in July? the answer was, the complete state of destitution in
<col>1036</col>
which the present ministers found themselves in on entering into office, with respect to every preparation for a continental expedition, rendered an earlier dispatch impossible. The first thing done was, to give orders to prepare transports; but from the active state of our trade, they could not be sooner collected, and thus it had been impossible to send to the king of Sweden the aid of cavalry which we were bound to afford. With respect to the question of the hon. gent., if such a number of troops were now embarked in a fortnight, why were they not embarked before? the answer was, a wise government always had its arrangements made in such a manner, that it could carry into effect its military enterprises in so short a time, that those who were the objects of them would only hear of the preparation when they felt the blow. But if no preparations were left, our military strength could only be exhibited in an inert and inactive state upon our own shores, till the deficiency should have been supplied. If the preparations had been made, the military energy would have been exerted without delay. He trusted that what had been done now would prove a lesson to every future government, a lesson not to postpone preparation till the moment was come for striking the blow. If the necessary preparations had been left by the late ministers, the exertion might have been made at an earlier period, when it might have contributed to ward off what had happened. Russia had expected our co-operation,and if the late government did not give that aid, it was owing to a false economy which, for the object of a trifling saving, crippled the means of the country, at the moment when it was most essential to exert them. To have exhibited preparations for any considerable embarkation, would have obliged Buonaparte to leave at least 50,000 men in France of what since appeared on the Vistula. It was the advantage of our insulated and central position, that if we had preparations for an expedition in or near the Downs, ready to move to any quarter thought proper, France would be under the necessity of keeping a protecting force in Holland, in the Netherlands, at Boulogne, and at Brest, at the same time, from the impossibility of ascertaining which of those points was to be attacked. It was in this respect that this country, though essentially naval, could bring its military power to be of great weight against France, The late Ministers came into the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0541"/>
<col>1037</col>
means of making great exertions, but they parted with those means apparently for no other purpose but that of registering their abandonment of the continent. Whether the battle of Eylau awakened them to a sense of their criminal omission, he could not say; or whether they had begun to be fearful of falling into disgrace with the whole country, for having postponed their aid so long; but he did find some traces in his office, that indicated a disposition to rouse from its guilty lethargy; but nothing like an active step had been taken to succour those who expected our aid.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>complimented the noble lord on his prudence in reserving these extensive accusations for an occasion when they were only incidentally introduced, and when no specific answer could be made to them. He could excuse the temporary warmth with which the right hon. gent. had launched out on one of those topics of accusation; but the noble lord had brought forth a grand declamation, had assumed facts totally unproved, and had made statements wholly without foundation, for the purpose of censuring the general conduct of the war by the late administration. He had prudently forborne producing these general charges until near the close of the session, then incidentally, when no reply could be given to them, having omitted to bring forward any allegations during four months that he had been in power. As far as he could, he would distinctly go over the statements of the noble lord. His first general charge against his majesty's late ministers, was of supineness and abandonment of the continent. Whether an army ought to have been sent at all to the continent, whether it thought to have been sent to one place or to another&#x2014;these were grand questions of policy not to be decided immediately, or obliquely. If the gentlemen opposite had a mind to arraign the conduct of the late administration on this subject, in God's name let them appoint a day for that purpose. The question was, whether it would not have been ridiculous for an insular power, like Great Britain, to attack the considerable armies on the continent, when the very next minute, her own defence might require the presence at home of every soldier whom she could collect? When he said this he did not mean to go so far as to assert, that no occasion could in his opinion arise, in which such a cooperation on our part would be unadviseable. So with regard to subsidies, were
<col>1038</col>
we to be merely the great bank of Europe, on which the different nations should be empowered to draw in defence of their own existence? Was that a good habit to give them? Was not the result likely to be that they would make no spontaneous exertions? But in asking these questions, did he say, that subsidies ought never to be granted? These were great questions of national importance, and not to be decided upon by a declamatory speech, but to the discussion of which the house ought to come with a full knowledge of all the circumstances of the case. The noble lord asserted, that the late administration ought to have subsidized and sent troops to the continent. He, on the other hand, asserted, that they ought to have done neither the one nor the other more than they did do. When they came into office, the season was improper for sending out troops, and when the proper season came, was not such aid out of the question? Could it be hoped, that when the mighty powers of Europe, for some time poised in air, had taken their pitch and direction, any military effort made by this country could avail? That the continental powers called for our assistance, might be easily supposed; but when the noble lord asserted that we had given assurances of assistance, and particularly of cavalry, all he could say was, that he did not know that such assurances had been given, and that he did believe that they bad been given. This fact withdrawn, down fell the whole pile of argument which the noble lord had been erecting. "For," said the noble lord, "you made no preparations to send assistance." Very true; because no assistance had been promised, nor was immediately in view. But the noble lord was surprized why no show of assistance had been made. He would assure the noble lord, not from economical motives (any more than the discharge of transports, which the noble lord had so fallaciously stated arose from the decision of the late ministry to terminate all communication with the continent), but from the consideration that in the state of Europe at that time, it was not wise to make a show, as by such a demonstration the enemy would be put upon their guard, and might be able to defeat objects, otherwise attainable. When the noble lord talked of sending 25,000 men to the armies of Russia and Prussia, the thing was so absurd, that it was unnecessary to answer him. With regard to the army, it had, in point of fact,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0542"/>
<col>1039</col>
grown in the hands of his majesty's late government, who had left the regular force 8000, and the general force 10,000 men, stronger than what they received it from their predecessors. Such, by the accounts on the table, was the increase of the army, from March 1806, to March 1807, from whatever causes that increase might have arisen. The late administration had been also attacked on their conduct, with regard to Buenos Ayres. The original expedition to that place, though certainly not under the orders of the gentlemen opposite, was undertaken by an officer of their appointment: and whose conduct had since been justified by pretty strong marks of their approbation: for, having been found guilty by a court martial of a very serious offence, he had, as a reward, when fresh from the censure of that court martial, and in mockery of its proceedings, been appointed out of his turn to another and most important command. A most mischievous step, and one fraught with consequences highly dangerous to the interests of the navy! By this step, however, the noble lord and his colleagues recognized and adopted the attack on Buenos Ayres, and now he had the modesty (for he would not call it by its proper name) to accuse the late administration of doing that which, what had been done without their control rendered necessary. As to the transports, the noble lord said, that he (Mr. W.) had made a magnificent statement of the many thousand tons of transports taken up by the late administration. All his magnificence was this fact, that while his majesty's late ministers parted with the larger class of transports, the three months' ships, for which they had no immediate use, and which were easily to be got if wanted, they had taken up as many as they could procure of coppered and sheathed ships, which were not to be obtained in a hurry, and in which a sudden demand created a great advance of price, Of this last description they had left, he believed, a greater number than they found, at least such he knew was the comparative state of the transport service not long before his quitting office. He had thought it necessary to say thus much, in answer to the grand flourish of the noble lord, which was calculated to make an impression at a time of the session when it could not be duly met, and which it was, no doubt, hoped would work to the country during the summer. The country, however, would not forget that his majesty's ministers had
<col>1040</col>
been four months in office, and had been repeatedly, but in vain, called on to bring forward distinct allegations against their predecessors.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>said, that in affirming that the 9th regiment of dragoons had returned from pursuing its destination, consequence of the state of the transports in winch they had embarked, he was not guilty of mis-statement&#x2014;they came back to request copper-bottoms. The grand policy of his late right hon. friend (Mr.Pitt) was, that there was always, during his administration, every thing in readiness for the immediate embarkation of at least 10,000 men; a striking instance of that policy, and the good consequences resulting from it, was in the successful expedition of sir David Baird to the Cape; whereas, on his coining into office, there was not above 11,000 tonnage of copper-bottomed transports. But certainly the policy between the two governments was different, for the right hon. gent. had candidly admitted that his government had no intention whatever of sending out troops to the continent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>denied that he had ever made such admission; what he had said was, that the government had then no immediate intention of sending out troops to the continent, and he had endeavoured to prove that they were then right, in, at that time, acting up to such a policy. As to the transports, there was not a single ship fit for that purpose, that was rejected by the transport office.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>said, that all who were conversant in the nature of preparing expeditions, must know that copper-bottomed transports, amounting to 10,000 tons, could embark only 4000 men. He had said, that the late ministers left in employ behind them but 11,000 tonnage, and he contended that such was a conclusive proof that the late government had not then in idea any effort for the relief of the continent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>said, that if the noble lord took up transports with the same avidity with which he took up facts, the present government could never be deficient in transports. He (Mr. W.) could not then speak from memory, and therefore he would not, as the noble lord had done, throw out vague charges and loose assertions; but he did believe that it was not as the noble lord had so confidently stated; and admitting the truth of the statement, how
<image src="S1V0009P0I0543"/>
<col>1041</col>
did it affect the question at issue? At a certain period every thing was out in due readiness for the embarkation of troops to the continent, and therefore the continent was abandoned by the minister of the day! This mode of arguing might be new as argument, but not new as argument coming from the noble lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>defended the appointment of sir Home Popham, which had been so pointedly alludes to by the right hon. gent. Sir Home Popham had been selected by admiral Gambier as his captain, and his right of selection was not to be disputed. Lord Howe had selected sir Roger Curtis, and that selection had given rise to no animadversion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>said, that the animadversions on the appointment of sir Home Popham naturally followed from what had been said on the other side with respect to that expedition, which had originated with a former ministry, who had been active in bringing forward that officer. As to the precedent that had been cited, he could not accede to it; for he well knew that the appointment of sir Roger Curtis had given rise to very general dissatisfaction, and he had reason to believe that the selection of sir Home Popham had also given rise to great dissatisfaction, and he would add, that were not that officer now absent, on the service of his country, he Should feel it his duty to submit to parliament a motion relative to an enquiry into a certain bargaining transaction at the Cape, in which the expedition to South America had originated, and in which that office was not a little concerned. The noble lord opposite to him, in his strictures on the late administration, had taken an opportunity of giving him his share of the general censure. The imputation thrown on him by the noble lord, he should ever consider as a merit, because it was an imputation of economy. He should not be ashamed of having used his humble efforts to husband the resources of the country in a crisis like the present, when there was such demand for the wise, and useful, and considerate application of them. The noble lord opposite should be, therefore, the less surprized if his own financial propositions had not met with the fullest approbation from one who thought too well of economy to approve of any plan that went to scout it. In that case, too the noble lord had not forgotten to deal out his usual imputations against him, when that noble lord was submitting to that house a plan
<col>1042</col>
which, if it did not contain a sublime system of economy, certainly did <ob/> a sublime contempt of figures&#x2014;A great deal had been said of the supineness of the late government, in not aiding the efforts of our allies upon the continent. It was, however, worthy of observation, that since the year 1793, down to the present period, it had been the constant and uniform plan of one set of Men in this country, to talk of rescuing the continent; of saving. restoring, and establishing Europe. That had been their undeviating policy; and yet this great and mighty plan had either not yet been rightly conceived, or if so, had entirely failed, and contributed to increase that power it was meant to overthrow. It was ridiculous to talk of saving Europe, if Europe could not save herself. It was not in the desperate affairs of the continent that England could step in and save her. No; she had only to look to better times. She could be most useful in following up victory, not in remedying defeat; and therefore, was a government wise in keeping up and refusing to exhaust the resources of the country until they could be useful? "Et rebus vosmet servate secundis." If, however, it was thought by gentlemen opposite, that a continental expedition ought to have been forwarded and might have had effect, he called upon those gentlemen to state, at what one period they would have taken upon themselves to have advised such a measure. He defied the present ministers to state the specific time, during that period, in which they would say such an expedition would have been serviceable. The &#x00E6;ra of the battle of Eylau had been generally spoken of; but were the immediate events of that battle forgotten? Here the noble lord entered into a comparative statement of the affairs of the continent, subsequently to the battles of Eylau and Ulm, and contended that for three months after the latter period, the British troops had not reached the continent: had, however, the warning voice of his right hon. friend, now no more, (Mr. Fox,) been then attended to, the prostration of Europe might have been prevented; for what contributed more to the subjugation of the continent than the coalitions which were successively embarked in?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>warmly reprobated the policy that had been laid down by the noble lord, and contended that either that noble lord had been directing his censures
<image src="S1V0009P0I0544"/>
<col>1043</col>
against the late premier (lord Grenville), who was of old such an advocate for continental co-operation, or that that nobleman had lately become the convert of the economical late chancellor of the exchequer; he ridiculed the application of the classical quotation with which the noble lord had favoured the house&#x2014;"et rebus vosmet servate secundis;"&#x2014;for, if it meant any thing so applied, it was to be rendered thus&#x2014;"while victory is with you, we will be with you; but the moment it leaves you, we shall leave you, and wait for better times." He said, that from his own official documents he had authority in stating that our allies upon the continent had the fullest expectations of assistance and co-operation on our parts; and of all the difficulties he had to contend with since his coming into office, the most difficult was that of endeavouring to satisfy foreign ministers for the gross failure, on our part, in answering these expectations. That difficulty was now, however, in a great degree removed by what had fallen, in the course of the present debate, from the right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham). And, as it was well known, that by some means or other what passed within that house went out to the public, to the country, and to the world; he rejoiced that the country and others would thereby be put in possession of what fell from the right hon. gent., when he admitted with that candour, of which certainly he could not divest himself if he would, that the late government had not in view any expedition to the continent. And why, he asked, had they not? Would they deny opportunity the most favourable? Here the right hon. secretary went into a detail of the history of the late campaign, as affecting Prussia, and contended, that never was there an occasion in which assistance on the part of Great Britain would have been in ore opportune or more effective; and as to the sincerity of Prussia, there could not exist a doubt from the very nature of the contest; besides that Prussia had, since her rupture with France, refused peace with that power, unless concluded in concert with Russia. In 1795, it was thought wise to subsidize Prussia and co-operate with her in order to induce her to go beyond her frontiers; but in the late campaign, when she was so deeply interested and had so deeply ventured, it was thought hazardous, unwise and impolitic to join with her in the common cause. But the right hon. gent. had
<col>1044</col>
joked upon the uselessness of "making a show," that is, of making every necessary preparation for immediate embarkation; he could only say, that he knew too well how to prize that right hon. gent's ingenuity to suppose for a moment that that gentleman did not perfectly understand the nature of, and good consequences that might result from, a well-managed diversion.&#x2014; He was perfectly ready to confess, that his noble friend ought to retract one part of his accusation, and that was, that the right hon. gent. had not acted dextrously on his own plan; for if he had determined completely to abandon the continent, certainly he acted on that plan with the greatest assiduity and effect. When the right hon. gent. urged, that it was for the interest of this country to shut itself up, and abandon the continent, and when the noble lord stated the benefits of economy, he put it to them to declare, whether they actually believed that either an economical war, or an efficient peace, could be secured by abandoning the continent, and thus setting the continent the example of abandoning this country. It was not true, that in the last war the negociations with Prance had always been commenced by the continental powers; the instances were numerous in which they had been led by Great Britain. In the present war, Great Britain and Russia were on equal terms. Russia had but a remote interest in the contest: if, therefore, it were said, that by making peace with France, Russia had abandoned us, he would answer, that we had engaged with Russia&#x2014;not for the purchase of her blood and exertions, but that, seeing her manfully struggling against the common enemy, we had engaged to lend her our aid. Russia, however, finding that no assistance was at hand, and that the promises of Great Britain had vanished in air, after sheaving how well she could bear up against the overwhelming torrent of French power, had agreed to make peace. The late coalition had certainly terminated with regard to us in a manner different from any of the former ones. In former coalitions, the powers of the continent left us alone, and fled from their engagements; now they had left us alone, but they had not fled from their engagements, nor in the slightest degree violated their faith. If the right hon. gent. disputed this, he would go step by step to the proof.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor-General</member> <membercontribution>for Scotland depre-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0545"/>
<col>1045</col>
cated the manner in which the name and appointment of an hon. officer (sir H. Popham) had been introduced into the discussion by a noble lord opposite. If that noble lord thought that there was any thing culpable imputable to that officer, it was his duty to bring forward a charge against him, whilst he was in that house, and had an opportunity of defending himself. When he looked to the manner in which that topic bad been that evening introduced, he must say that he thought it highly indecent. If the noble lord had attended to the result of a former enquiry instituted in that house against the same gallant officer, it might have had the effect of inducing him to abstain from the charges which he had that night urged. For his own part, he must deny, that there had been any thing in that enquiry, or in the judgement of the court martial upon his conduct, that could render his appointment as captain of the fleet, improper or irregular. The noble lord might have found, in the case of a junior officer, captain Bowen, who had been appointed by the late to commander-in-chief of the channel fleet, captain of the fleet, just ground of complaint. He did not mean to say, that the officer to whose appointment he alluded, was not a most meritorious officer, or that he had not performed the duties of the station to which he had been appointed with ability and credit, but he mentioned the circumstance only to shew, that that appointment was not strictly conformable to the practice of the service. He hoped the noble lord would feel, that it was not justifiable by such charges as he had made, in the absence of the individual against whom they were directed, to endeavour to whisper away the character of any officer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>said, that any thing which occurred in that house could not be characterized as whispering upon the subject to which it applied. His noble friend had adverted to a transaction that had already appeared in all the newspapers, the agreement entered into between sir H. Popham and sir D. Baird, respecting the division of the prize money, before a single man had been embarked on the expedition against Buenos Ayres, which, he said, was a fit subject to be enquired into in that house. In fact, the matter was at present the subject of a suit in one of the courts of law. As to the appointment of sir H. Popham to the post he filled, he must say, that it had given general dissatisfaction in the
<col>1046</col>
navy. As to the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Canning), he had placed himself in an awkward situation, by the statement. which he had that night made. If he, or his friends, thought that the late ministers had not done their duty, they should bring a charge against them; and he would pledge himself, if they should make out a case, to support them. But he was relieved from that duty, by the mis-statements of the noble lord (Castlereagh) and the right hon. gent. That noble lord had, in utter contempt of all historical fact, and in perversion of all circumstances and dates, imputed to the late administration of 14 months, all the evils of the preceding 14 years administration. The house, to judge of this, should recollect how the contest had begun. It would appear from the dispatches of lord G. L. Gower in 1805, that Austria had been dragged into the war, when she declared herself that she was not prepared for it. After having brought Austria to her ruin, and subsidized disinterested Russia, the right hon. gentleman now charged all the evils that resulted from such measures upon his hon. friends, who had succeeded to the end of that contest. Now, it was charged upon the late administration, that they had ruined the continent. He denied the fact; it was Mr. Pitt, and the measures pursued under his administration, that had ruined the continent; and highly as he respected the character of lord Grenville, of whom he had not the honour of much personal knowledge, he had not discovered any ground for altering the opinion he formerly entertained upon that subject. It was unnecessary to recur to the rapid events that had occurred from the battle of Auerstadt to the battle of Friedland, events which no force that could be sent from this country could have averted for a single day, or a single hour. As to the offers of peace to Prussia, from the moment of the flight of the king from Jena, she was as incapable of making peace without the consent of Russia, as of carrying on the war after the armistice of Tilsit. The noble lord had observed of him, that he shewed his independence by animadverting upon his friends, as well as his adversaries. For his part, he was as much attached to party as any man could be; but on such public questions he should never suffer any consideration to influence his unbiassed judgment; and in the part he took upon such occasions, he wished to benefit his country by eliciting the truth from both sides upon these
<image src="S1V0009P0I0546"/>
<col>1047</col>
important subjects. As to lord Grenville every one would allow him to be an able politician, and this he would say of him, that he had disapproved of the Spanish war. The noble lord opposite had said, that after the negotiation hart broken off, an army should have been sent to the support of Prussia: but Prussia was then at war with us, and, after the battle of Auerstadt,the winter season rendered it impossible to send any expedition. Where could men have been then sent to co-operate with the Russians, even after the battle of Eylau, which he still looked upon to have been disastrous for the Russians? It had been said, that Prussia, by joining the coalition before the battle of Austerlitz, might have turned the scale, which he did not think would have been the case, but she neglected that opportunity, and had brought herself into her present situation, as he had before said, by her insane rashness. Here this country then was without an ally. If the late ministers had brought it into that situation, a charge ought to be brought against them for it, rather than by misrepresentation, to impute blame to them. Even at this late period of the session, he should think the enquiry might be gone into, and he hoped that there would be no objection to the production of all communications with the Prussian government. The right hon. gentlemen opposite, when after the dissolution they had arranged every thing for the election, then turned their attention to the continent. The expeditions they had sent out he wished might prove successful, but he hoped they would not prove an example of that dispersion of the disposeable force of the country, which had been charged upon his right hon. friends.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>said, that it was no more the duty of the present ministers to bring a charge against their predecessors, that, it was the duty of their predecessors to bring a charge against them. He thought his predecessors wrong, and that they had ruined the continent. But as the conduct of an existing government might involve the country in disaster, if the gentlemen opposite thought them wrong they ought to bring a charge against them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham rose</member> <membercontribution>to clear himself from some misrepresentations of the right honourable secretary of state. He liked his ingenuity and eloquence very well; but did not think his arguments the most respectable. He imputed opinions and assertions to gentlemen, that he might
<col>1048</col>
answer them himself, by which means he had always enough to say. A man might very easily be affluent who coined his own money. There was no want of words, where he had a manufactory of epithets. The right hon. gent. went on briskly, for the rode very light, and carried no weight.&#x2014; He then shewed the difference between the system of the last ministers, as to contmental affairs, and that which was imputed to them. They had not seen any proper opportunity for a diversion, or they would have made it. They had made no promise and neglected it. After various explanatory remarks, he begged gentlemen to prefer their charges fairly and seriously, and he would Meet them. He requested the house to mark the right hon. secretary's receipt for making speeches. He put all sorts of ridiculous things into the mouths of his political opponents, that he might wake out his speech, by answering them. He made them something like a second person, in a dialogue, who was made to talk a good deal of nonsense, to set off his opponent in the argument. But though he liked eloquence very well, he could not praise the respectability of the right hon. gent's arguments.&#x2014;The resolution was then put, and carried.<lb/>
On the question, that 15,000<i>l</i>. be granted for Inspecting Field-officers of Volunteers,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>contended, that even in the opinion of the volunteers themselves, these were useless. They might be inspected by the generals of the districts. This had been a project to answer election purposes. As it had done all the good it could do in that way, he thought the ministers might give up the matter, and save some expence to the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War</member> <membercontribution>wished to know if the inspection by generals of districts had been practised during the right hon. gent's administration. The number of volunteers, he believed, was in many instances greater where there were no general officers. As to the idea of a job, he asserted that the inspecting field-officers had in general, or rather without an exception, been re-appointed, without regard to the degree of interest they might posses. It could, therefore, be of little consequence whether the re-appointment had taken place on the eve of an election or not. He contended that the Volunteer spirit had greatly subsided in many counties since that right hon. gent. had come into office.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0547"/>
<col>1049</col>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>admitted that a relaxation to the volunteering spirit had taken place; but maintained that it had manifested itself some considerable time previous to his coming into office.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Tarleton</member> <membercontribution>said, the volunteers in the district in which he had the honour to command, could never have reached the state of discipline to which they had arrived but for the exertions of the Inspecting Field-officers. If an invasion had taken place two years ago, they would have been able, from that district, in the course of two days, to have produced 30,000 men within ten miles of the metropolis.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Calcraft</member> <membercontribution>stated that before his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham)came into office, the Volunteer force had decreased from 400.000 to 318,000, and during his administration they had fallen off in a much less proportion, not having decreased above 20 or 25,000 men. He remembered that he himself as a volunteer, had been inspected by Major-generals and lieutenant-generals, and he did not see why that practice might not be continued. The gallant general (Tarleton) had now his head-quarters at Bath, and it was a great pity that the parliament did not sit there, as in such a case the gallant general could reconcile his senatorial duties with the duties of commanding officer of the district, and in such case he might again honour the volunteers so far as to review them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Tarleton</member> <membercontribution>said a few words in explanation, and imputed to the hon. gent. great military ignorance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>retorted the charge of a job, by alluding to th 300 surveyors of taxes, proposed to have been appointed by the late administration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Beresford</member> <membercontribution>deprecated the system of recrimination which had become so much the practice of members on both sides of the house. As to the subject immediately before the house, he felt himself necessitated to say, that the language held in that house by the right hon. gent. and the measures adopted by him, had such an effect on the volunteers in Ireland, as to make at least one half of those who had been most zealous in the service, turn their backs upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Solicitor-General</member> <membercontribution>of Scotland spoke in praise of the Scotch volunteers, whom he also stated to have been very much discouraged by the language of Mr. Windham.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>Said, the arguments of the last hon. and learned gent. were merely
<col>1050</col>
to the old tune, "No pay, no Swiss." This wonderful relaxation of the spirit of the Scotch volunteers, was to be attributed to some diminution of the former allowances. If, however, the number of the Scotch volunteers was much diminished, it must be allowed, that this diminution begun long before he came into Office, or had any prospect of coming into office, and therefore these gentlemen must have had the gift of second sight, to know both that he would come into office, and what he was to propose. He had often objected to what was called the volunteer system: but as to the individuals themselves, it was impossible that any one could pretend to turn into ridicule the population of England, Ireland, or Scotland, or that proportion of the population which evidently appeared most ardent in the general defence. As to what an hon. gent. had said about the disgrace of crimination and recrimination between the different parties, he agreed so far in that opinion, that he did not wish unnecessarily to indulge in it; but if it obviously occurred in the course of a discussion, he was not content to pair off.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>said, he recollected a very different history respecting that corps. They were a corps that wanted greater allowances to be made to them than what was usual. An hon. general (Tarleton) had, in his explanation, accused an hon. friend of his of gross ignorance in military matters. The house would, however, recollect that about a fortnight ago, the hon. general had exerted all his military calculation to persuade the house that Bonaparte had advanced so far in Poland that it was next to impossible he should ever be able to retreat. After so recent a promulgation of his military opinions, he thought the house would not believe that every military man was completely ignorant of his profession, who might differ in opinion from the. hon. general.&#x2014; After some conversation, the committee divided: For the vote 34; Against it 24.<lb/>
A vote of credit, amounting to 4,500,000<i>l</i>. for Great Britain, and 500,000<i>l</i>. for Ireland, was also proposed and agreed to, after some opposition from lord H Petty, sir J. Newport, and Mr. Windham. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in answer to the observations against the amount, said, that there were many exigencies which might call for the employment of the surplus. A case, for example, might be supposed to arise, when it might be necessary, to call

<p><member>[PUBLICANS' LICENCE BILL.] Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>presented a petition from certain publicans, &amp;c. praying the aid of parliament, in alleviation of certain grievances with respect to the granting and revoking of Licences. The petition was ordered to lie on the table. Mr. S. then rose and said, that the petition he just had the honour of presenting was signed by more than 1,000 persons. As to the abuses of which that petition complained, and the remedy which he proposed for those abuses, he must at present decline entering into them. He contended that they could be satisfactorily proved upon the most unquestionable testimony, at the <ob/>. He said that he had made every enquiry into the alledged abuses, and had no doubt he should convince gentlemen, to their astonishment, of the cruel and grinding oppression which in many instances had been practised towards that body. The great object of his endeavour to relieve them would at least be, to have it made certain by parliament, that the bread, the livelihood, the very means of existence to those people and their families, should not depend on the will or the caprice of any two magistrates, without an appeal to some of the courts of judicature.

The latter was a more settled and compact force, and were less liable to the ill effects of a constant succession of new officers, than the regular, forces. The hon. gent. dwelt on the importance of uniting, as much as possible, the character of the soldier and the citizen. The militia force was a most constitutional body, and ought not by any means to be discouraged, as would be done by the present bill. He must also object to it as going obliquely to undermine the system of military service introduced last year by his right. hon. friend, while it was not directly and manfully brought under the consideration of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitshed Keene</member> <membercontribution>rose and said: In this late stage of the important subject now before the house, I beg leave to trouble it for a short time. I am one of those that voted for the measures proposed by his majesty's ministers, not that. I thought them complete for the purpose, or that they were the best that might have been devised, but because, after having considered every thing that has been thrown out on the different sides of the house, (who all agree in the end although they differ as to the means) I thought this mode preferable, from a persuasion that as it was apparent a large deficiency must exist for some time in our military, establishments, it was the interest of our country, under the present exigency, the deficiency should be thrown on the militia, rather than on our regular force; both on the probability of that deficiency, being sooner filled up with trained soldiers, applicable to every purpose, than by any other mode proposed; and again, on the probability of that deficiency in the militia, being made good in an easier and more economical manner, than it would be if it existed in the troops of the line. The length to which this session has been protracted, by the circumstances which have occurred, may, perhaps, justify the officers of government in not proposing to this house at present further measures, which possibly might retard this measure, which promises expeditiously a great increase of that force of the country adapted either to offensive or defensive operations. As government has the best means of judging how far the danger may be more or less imminent, on them
<image src="S1V0009P0I0549"/>
<col>1053</col>
lies the responsibility of thinking no more need be done in the present session. However inconvenient a further attendance might be, that inconvenience would plead but little, should any injury to our country take place, which might have been prevented by further measures. I trust they are not mistaken, and I have the satisfaction of believing from what has fallen from ministers, that they intend taking the earliest opportunity to ameliorate, extend and organize a more complete system of defence and offence; it would be wasting he time of the house, to occupy it, in endeavouring to prove an imperious necessity, which must overrule all minor objections to such measures as may put our internal security on the best footing, and also afford the best means of preserving our external greatness. Every thinking man's mind being naturally employed on those great objects, may I be permitted to submit to the house some Suggestions, which I humbly conceive are well worth being considered, and that they may be so modeled as to promise to effect this great object as far as the physical powers of our country will admit. They are the Suggestions of a man, who having served many years at the head of the militia of the county of which he was also lord, (and had therefore better means of being acquainted with the bearing and operation of the militia laws in the different situations of our country,) and during several of the campaigns in the American war, in many of the last war with France, and in various parts of Great Britain, employed a strong understanding in weighing the advantages and disadvantages attending this service, according to the different circumstances of our country. Sir, I apprehend, however great our gratitude ought and must be to those enlightened and provident patriots who introduced and established this most important mode of national defence, however competent it has proved to its object during former times, yet no man will contend that, in the present state of Europe, (which it is necessary only to allude to) the same system must be applicable. I here must beg leave to advert to what many gentlemen in this house must recollect in 1799, when a French detachment had landed in Ireland; many of the regiments of the militia of this country volunteered their services to the sister kingdom, with an alacrity and zeal never to be forgotten. As the laws stood and now stand, an act of the legislature was necessary to legalize the
<col>1054</col>
acceptance of their services. This French detachment after some success, and having advanced considerably into the country, being disappointed in their expectations of a faithful, numerous, and zealous co-operation for which purpose they had brought many arms, surrendered. Had they not been disappointed in this expectation, it is not easy to appreciate, the important advantages that must have resulted from this patriotic act of the British militia; the act of the legislature however in its progress through the houses of parliament met with much opposition. In mentioning this, I am far from intending to impute any blame to those gentlemen who made that opposition. I am persuaded they acted, according to their view of the subject, in the manner most conducive to the best interest of their country. Gentlemen will also recollect, that on the renewal of hostilities with France, when Buonaparte lined the coast opposite to ours with his legions, and began to assemble his flotilla at Boulogne, many regiments of the Irish militia, seeing England threatened, seized the opportunity of testifying their gratitude by offering to come here; at the same time some regiments of English militia again volunteered to go to Ireland: at that moment, some most respectable leading characters in that service, thought proper to publish Resolutions expressing strong disapprobation of that measure, and stopped it. I cannot help lamenting that they thought <ob/> their duty so to act, as it is obvious that the facility of mutual defence was and will be thereby embarrassed; and what is of no less importance, though not so obvious, that it prevents the intermixture of a considerable part of the population of the two countries; a measure which would go further in seven years to render the union not merely nominal, but real, than the present mode of proceeding will do in fifty. Sir, I know too well the zeal with which the gentlemen of the militia have acted, the privations to which they have so long submitted, not to be persuaded that they on that occasion also acted according to their views of the best interest of their country, and that, had they thought the exigency required it, they would readily have gone there. At the same time that I think so highly of their patriotism, I am not less persuaded that from their good sense they would rather meet the enemy in Munster or Connaught, than in Yorkshire or Kent. As these latter considerations do not immediately
<image src="S1V0009P0I0550"/>
<col>1055</col>
belong to the question before us, I shall say no more on them at present; if it was permitted for so insignificant an individual as I am, to mention himself, I would say, that having had the honour to serve several campaigns in different parts of Europe, having, had the honour to serve 39 years in this house, and having attended all the discussions on these important subjects, I presume to think myself not totally incompetent on them; and concurring, as I do, in the soundness of these Suggestions, and persuaded that great national advantage may be derived from them, I will take the liberty to lay them before the house, They are as follow:&#x2014;1. "To enable Volunteers to propose to his majesty's lieutenants of counties, to form themselves into local militia, to be regularly trained for 28 days, with the same establishment, in the same manner, and under the same regulations as the old militia used to be in time of peace. To leave their counties only in case of invasion or imminent danger thereof." The object of this clause is to establish, at little expence, under command and under officers of some experience, a large body of men, which may be speedily applied to the public service in case of emergency. I would wish this source of supply to be extended to the number of 160,000. It may also, if it shall be consonant with the wisdom of parliament, to adopt the next proposition, be made a source whence may be drawn a supply of men to keep the embodied militia constantly full.&#x2014;2. "To enable his majesty to accept the voluntary services of one fourth part of the embodied militia annually, to serve in the regular army. And if the men so volunteering, were put invariably into the regiments that are reputed to belong to the counties from whence the men come, whenever those regiments shall want recruits or be augmented; if ensigncies were sometimes given on the recommendation of the lords lieutenants, to young men of those counties; these two measures could not fail of adding much to the facility of keeping our regular force complete; but as those two last arrangements are within the power of the commander-in-chief, that illustrious personage will certainly adopt whatever on consideration shall appear calculated for such important purposes." The object of this clause is to give (as is obvious) a regular supply of efficient men to the regular army. I would wish this
<col>1056</col>
force, the embodied militia, to be carried to the extent of 80,000 for Great Britain, giving annually a recruit of 20,000 men to the army, and establishing a force commensurate (as I apprehend) for the ordinary purposes of the kingdom; thereby leaving the whole, or the greatest part of the regular army, a disposeable force.&#x2014;3. "To enable lieutenants of counties to accept the voluntary services of as many men from the local militia as would fill up the deficiency occasioned by the drafts from the embodied militia into the army. If there shall be a deficiency of volunteers for filling up the embodied militia, that deficiency to be made good by a ballot, without exemptions, and deficiencies in the local militia to be supplied annually by a similar ballot." The object of this clause is to make use of the ballot only when indispensable, and then in a manner little burthensome.&#x2014;4. "To enable lieutenants of counties to employ the staff of the local militia in training the men intended to be transferred to the embodied militia, during the time such staff may not be actually on duty with the kcal militia." The object of this clause is to have the embodied militia complete in members acquainted with the use of arms.&#x2014;5. "To enable his majesty to direct lieutenants of counties, if he should see it proper so to do, to employ the said staff of the local militia, when not otherwise employed in exercising the persons bound to serve under the provisions of the Training act." The object of this clause is to give farther efficiency to the Training act, which is admirable, as giving to the crown the positive command of a large body of men in case of emergency, but which in its actual progress amounts to a muster of men.&#x2014;I humbly conceive that it is no small recommendation of these Suggestions, that at the same time, that if adopted together, they would draw forth the physical powers of the population in a most efficient and in the least expensive manner, and mutually strengthen each other, they may be applied with advantage separate, without adopting the whole. The one, to which the greatest objections would be made, is that of enabling his majesty to accept annually so considerable a number of volunteers into the regular army. This is not the moment to discuss this most important subject, I shall not therefore intrude longer on the time of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Secretary at War</member> <membercontribution>thought the present measure might have been assented to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0551"/>
<col>1041*</col>
without entering upon the plan of last year; but as it had been brought forward so often, he would call the attention of the house to some facts relative to that plan, as they appeared by the papers on the table of the house. The object of that plan was to provide a great increase for the regular army, and if it had failed in that, there was an end to the argument against the present measure, as trenching upon it. The right hon. secretary then stated from the returns, that the numbers recruited in the first six mouths of 1806, were 9,933 men. These were the numbers enlisted, and allowances were certainly to be made for those above the military age, and under the size; but it was to be considered, that during 3 of these months the recruiting, under the Additional Force act, was cramped by its being understood that it was to be repealed, Boys he put out of the question on both sides. But if he allowed 900 men for the number rejected, he thought it would be fully sufficient. The numbers procured under the right hon. gent.'s system, in the first six months, were 9,091 men. This view of the case was certainly not very favourable to the plan, as it procured no more that the old system. It was also to be considered, that the right hon. gent.'s system had been in full operation during the six months adverted to. It was true that the last six months had been more productive than the preceding period, but that was accounted for by the additional number of recruiting parties appointed, and the threat of dissolving the second battalions, unless they procured a certain number of men by a given time. The casualties of the whole army were about 18,000 men, and this was all the plan provided for, without taking into account the number who would claim their discharge. The number of desertions, too, appeared to be equal among the recruits under his plan and the former system, though the last six months was rather in favour of the former.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>begged to call the attention of the house to the conduct of the present ministers, vho never rested their measures on their own merit, but always went to comparisons. When in opposition, they had perpetually called for his right hon, friend's plan before he had been two months in office, and yet, after a lapse of 4 months, they themselves had come forward with this magnificent measure! They had taken care, too, to bring it forward at this late period of the session, and had
<col>1042*</col>
reserved the most obnoxious clause&#x2014;that of granting an option to enlist for a term of years, or for life, which destroyed in a great measure the effects of the plan of his right hon. friend, till the committee, that there might be no opportunity to consider it on the second reading, which was the time for debating it. The consequence was that many had gone out of town with a wrong impression of the nature of this measure. He then entered upon a defence of his right hon. friend's system. It was intended to supply the whole casualties of the army, in which the former system was grossly deficient. But this was not all the effect of the plan; it would have a much greater, in his opinion, whatever the noble lord opposite might think and say of it. It was natural for the noble lord to smile at a philosophic measure, as he tauntingly called it, who had never conceived any grand scheme in his life&#x2014;who never could generalize&#x2014;who from two figures before him could scarcely draw a legitimate conclusion&#x2014;who could do nothing but go on in the common routine way, and endeavour to impose himself on the multitude as a great statesman, but who had only this in common with his colleagues, that he was as great a statesman as he could be. The right hon. secretary had made allowances for the former method of recruiting, but none for that of his right hon. friend. He forgot the diminished bounties, and was for putting the boys out of the question, because he knew that, in this view, the advantage would have appeared greatly on the side of his right hon. friend's plan. He then talked of his right hon. friend's forgetting his measure. The right hon. secretary well knew there were offices which that plan had to go through&#x2014;offices to which one set of ministers might be more agreeable than another. At all events the dispatch did not entirely depend on his right hon. friend. But this was the way of ministers, they always set up a vague and indefinite cry. Sometimes the church was in danger, sometimes one mode of recruiting was good, sometimes another. But his right hon. friend long ago had felt the unfitness of temporary expedients for permanent evils. Even in the school of the great founder of expedients (Mr. Pitt), he had not entirely approved of these, but had only acquiesced in giving them a trial. Ministers talked of emergency, but there was no end of their emergencies, and in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0552"/>
<col>1043*</col>
stead of having a permanent system to meet real emergencies; they were always calling out emergencies, and resorting to expedients to meet them. But these expedients could not always answer, and they were attended with this mischief, that they exhausted the country, and by that means destroyed the materials on which a permanent measure would have to work.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>supported the bill. It was highly necessary to increase the force of the country, for now that Buonaparte had been so successful on the continent, he would be induced to attempt achievements to which even his bold spirit had not hitherto prompted him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>said, his hon. and learned friend (Dr. Laurence) had been mistaken and mis-stated as well as himself, and both had been charged with uttering opinions that the country was in no danger. They had never said so; but had only contended that ministers had not shewn an emergency which required that this particular measure should be resorted to. The first question on this head was, what was the nature of the emergency, and, the next, if the measure now proposed was calculated to meet that emergency? He denied that it was. It was nothing more than a temporary remedy to guard against a permanent mischief. They ought to look forward, and provide permanent remedies to meet and counteract permanent evils. If they went on in this manner, living from hand to mouth, providing only for the present, and taking no thought for the future, they would come at last to a state in which the present could no longer be provided for. They might safely neglect the future as long as it was future, but they should recollect, that what was future would in time become present. His own measure was on the contrary calculated to provide a permanent force, to meet a danger which was equally permanent, and to operate at all times the defence of the country. Those temporary expedients only placed the country in the situation of a person who was supported by drams and cordials, which, however they might give an apparent increase of animal spirits, must in the end destroy his health, constitution, and life. This measure professed to make an addition in the course of 12 months, and to provide a force of 40,000 men, and immediately to obtain 28,000 men by a transfer from the militia to the army; but this was a fallacious way of reckoning, for in
<col>1044*</col>
respect to the transfer if one service gained, the other lost so many, and when they reckoned on those they would gain by the ballot, they would take into the account those they would lose by recruiting, which this measure would cut up entirely. He concluded by desiring to impress upon the recollection of the house, the debate of this night, and the project now to be substituted upon mere speculation, in place of another which had been found effective, was not allowed time for fair experiment; but which had, in the last 3 months, produced at the rate of 24,000 men per annum, and must in every moral certainty improve, nay, perhaps, double its operation in another year, while the present measure would operate effectively in the first instance, but exhaust the sources of future strength. The house would find, when next called on for the annual supply of the public force, that this measure would fail, and destroy, in one way, the strength it produced in another.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>replied in support of his bill, which he said would in six months add a force to the army of the country, which the right hon. gent.'s plan would not have added in six years; for it was only calculated to feed the ordinary deficiencies by casualty, to keep its strength just where it stood. Besides, at the end of seven years by that plan, 53,000 men would be entitled to their discharge, which, added to the ordinary deficiences for the year, would create such a chasm in the public force, as the right hon. gent. would find impossible to recruit in a year: and as to the Training act, it was impossible to bring it in operation before the commencement of next session.&#x2014;The report was then taken into further consideration, and upon the clause substituting the option of unlimited for limited service, a division took place; when there appeared,. For the clause 96; against it 46.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[OFFICES IN REVERSION BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The order of the day having beep read for the second reading of this bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Arden</member> <membercontribution>rose. He considered the bill to be an unnecessary and indecent attack upon the king's lawful prerogative. Nothing whatever had been stated to prove that such a measure was necessary, except merely an expression in the preamble of the bill, that it was expedient for the public service. The manner also in which the bill originated was very unusual, and no
<image src="S1V0009P0I0553"/>
<col>1045*</col>
ground had been shewn to prove that there was any necessity to make such an attack upon the king's just prerogative. He should therefore oppose the bill and take the sense of the house upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Grosvenor</member> <membercontribution>expressed great regret at the opposition given to this bill by his noble friend. He conceived the bill to be so completely in unison with the popular feeling at the present moment, that it would be unwise to reject it, and he thought his majesty's ministers, by opposing the bill, would render themselves so unpopular that they would not long remain in office. He was a warm friend to the bill, not merely for its own sake, but for the sake of those measures of reform relative to the public expenditure, of which he considered this merely as the forerunner&#x2014;measures which were highly necessary at a crisis like the present, when it was of so much importance to engage the hearts as well as the arms of the people. He trusted their lordships would not be induced to reject the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>called their lordships' attention to his majesty's speech at the close of the last session, in which satisfaction was expressed at the conduct of the committee of finance, and contended that this bill, being the only measure which that committee had then recommended, the king's speech contained in effect an approval of the measure. After ministers had thus approved of the measure, after they had approved of it in the other house, and after the bill had been so long in this house, he was greatly astonished at the opposition it now experienced. He could not help also adverting to the conduct of his majesty's ministers upon this occasion. If they now thought this bill ought not to pass, why did they not attend in their places, and oppose it in a manly manner, instead of staying away themselves, and sending their friends and connections to oppose the bill? [None of the ministers were present, except the lord chancellor.] He did not mean by this to impute to the noble lord that he was sent there for that purpose; but that construction would be put upon such conduct by the public. He was convinced that the public feeling was strongly in favour of the bill; and that ought to be, at the present moment, a strong argument in its favour. The granting of offices in reversion he considered, to be highly prejudicial to the public service, and highly improper; such grants being frequently made to children, at a very early age, aud such offices, although requiring regulation, from a change of circum
<col>1046*</col>
stances, could not, during such grant, be regulated for the benefit of the public. He would instance one case, that of the large office held by the noble lord (Arden), and the reversion of which had been granted to him after the death of his father, whose public services were undoubtedly great, at a time when the income arising from it was comparatively trifling. The profits of it had since increased to an amount which could not possibly have been in the contemplation of any one, and which arose, in a great degree, from the misfortunes of the country. It would, no doubt, have been thought expedient to regulate an office of that description. He thought, upon every ground that could be stated, that this bill ought to be proceeded in.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Arden</member> <membercontribution>said, he was not sent to that house to oppose the bill, nor would he be sent there by any man: he opposed the bill because he conceived it to be his duty as a peer of parliament to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>in explanation, disclaimed any intention of throwing the least imputation upon the noble lord; he only meant to allude to the construction which would be put in the public mind upon the opposition given to the bill, coupled with the absence of his majesty's ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville</member> <membercontribution>said there was only one point in which he agreed with the noble lord (Lauderdale), namely, that which related to the absence of ministers. He wished they had been there to declare their sentiments in opposition to the bill, if such were the sentiments which they entertained upon the subject. But when the absence of ministers was spoken of, he would ask, where were the illustrious members of the late administration? Why did not they attend to support their own bill, and display their parental fondness for their own offspring? He denied that this measure had been approved of or alluded to in his majesty's speech. The speech applauded the general object the committee of finance, namely, to enquire into the means of reforming and economizing the public expenditure, but could not be made to apply to the present measure. No argument had, he contended, been adduced in favour of the present measure, except an assertion, that it was agreeable to the public feeling. He did not believe that there was any such feeling in the public mind, nor was there any thing in the bill by which the public could be benefited. If the bill were to pass, not a sixpence
<image src="S1V0009P0I0554"/>
<col>1047*</col>
would be saved by it; the offices would remain the same; and, the only object of it would be to encroach upon the king's just and lawful prerogative. The noble lord had spoken of reversions being granted to children, but was it not the practice, when great services had been performed by an Admiral or General, to confer hereditary honours, and to grant also an annual sum, which was not confined to the person to whom granted, but was extended to his descendants? It had been the constant practice of our ancestors to act upon this principle. He would put a case also to shew the expediency of acting upon it in other instances: suppose a person was rendered incapable by age or infirmity from executing the duties of an office which he had held for 20 or 30 years; such a person was not to be turned out without some provision. There were in this case only two modes of acting; the one by a pension, and the other by granting the reversion of the office to his son or other relation, who might assist him in the office. By the former mode, a charge was made upon the public during the life of that person, and in the latter there was no additional expense. He could discover nothing in support of this bill, but an assertion that it was expedient; whilst, on the other hand, there was the uniform practice of our ancestors. He could not, therefore, consent to such a bill as the present, nor could he for a moment consent, that after a beneficent reign of nearly half a century, such an attack should be made upon the prerogative and influence of a beloved and revered monarch.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>said, as the noble viscount had begun his speech by stating that there was only one point in the speech of his noble friend (the earl of Lauderdale), in which he agreed, so he would observe that there was only one point in the speech of the noble viscount in which he had the good fortune to agree, and that was, that his majesty's ministers ought to have been present to have declared their sentiments in a a manly manner upon this bill. As to the charge made by the noble viscount, of the absence of the members of the late administration, he could assure their lordships, that, had there been the least expectation that this bill would be opposed, there would have been a full attendance of those noble lords, with whom he had the honour to act. But when it was recollected that only tour-and-twenty hours notice had been given of any intention to oppose
<col>1048*</col>
this bill (he did not mean to throw any imputation upon the noble lord who had commenced this debate), there was not much ground for surprise at the thin attendance. He thought it, however, of so much importance that this bill should be debated in a full house, that he intended to move to adjourn the debate till to-morrow, in order to give an opportunity for that full attendance, which the importance of the subject demanded. After the bill had been nearly a month before the house, without appearing to meet with any objection, be was astonished that it should now be attempted to be debated in a thin house, and at so late a period of the session. His noble friends had not attended, because they thought there was no intention of opposing the bill; he was convinced they would attend if the consideration of the bill was postpones till to-morrow. He entirely agreed with his noble friend (earl Grosvenor), that this bill was only to be considered as the forerunner of important measures of reform and economy in the public expenditure of the country. When it was in contemplation to abolish or to regulate offices, it was natural as the first step to be taken, to prevent those offices being granted in reversion, because if they were, it was obvious that for a considerable time no regulation could be applied to them. It was therefore that the public feeling was so much interested in this bill, which he contended it was, and he begged leave to say that he thought the noble viscount in denying the existence of this public feeling was mistaken. He was convinced that if ministers thought that the rejection of this measure would not be an unpopular measure, they would find themselves miserable mistaken. He denied that the bill was in encroachment upon the just prerogative of the crown; on the contrary, the granting places in reversion was an encroachment upon that prerogative, and upon this subject he would put the case, which though an extreme one, would shew the tendency of the argument, namely, that of all the offices being granted in reversion: it would necessarily follow, that the successor to the crown would find himself deprived of all influence. Reversions, besides, had a tendency to render the offices themselves sinecures, and sinecures were again granted in reversion: then reversions begat sinecures, and sinecures begat reversions. It might be true that, by the operation of this bill in itself, nothing would be saved;
<image src="S1V0009P0I0555"/>
<col>1049*</col>
but when it was considered as the first step to other measures, it must be viewed in a very different light; and although there might be considerable exaggeration as to the saving which it was possible to effect, yet, at the present moment, every sixpence and every halfpenny ought to be saved, in order to lighten, as much as possible, the burthens of the people. There might, perhaps, be a popular delusion upon this subject; but even that was an argument, at a crisis like the present, for agreeing to this bill. He did not conceive, however, that a bill of so much importance should be decided upon in so thin a house, and he should therefore move, that the debate be adjourned till to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>again referred to his majesty's speech at the close of the last session, his majesty's speech at the opening of the present session, and to the votes of the house of commons, containing the resolution on which the present bill was founded; and contended that his majesty's speeches contained a full approval of this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Melville</member> <membercontribution>again contended that his majesty's speeches only contained an approval of the general object of the committee of finance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member> <membercontribution>approved of the bill, upon the principle that it was to be considered as the forerunner of other great and important measures.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Boringdon</member> <membercontribution>said, however unpleasant it might be for him to differ in opinion with those with whom he usually agreed, he felt it incumbent upon him to support this bill. It was a measure to which the country looked with no little anxiety: considering it as recommended by his majesty, and expected by the public, it should have his support&#x2014;The question having been put on lord Holland's amendment, the house divided: Non-contents 15; Contents 9; Majority 6.&#x2014;The bill was then read a second time; and upon the question for the third reading, it was moved by lord Arden, that it should be read a third time this day 3 months, which was carried without a division.</membercontribution></p>

He thought also, that being enabled to read, they would waste their time in perusing inflammatory hand-bills, and other political productions; and that more mischief would be the result than good produced by it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>defended the principle of instructing all classes of society, and thought that those who opposed it must necessarily found their arguments upon mistake. Sedition, if it was at all to be propagated or encouraged by instruction or general knowledge, was much more likely to be so, by its being communicated by the ear, than it would be when communicated by the eye. It appeared to him that one ill-intentioned man, disposed to propagate sedition, might do infinitely more mischief, by inflaming the passions of the people by seditious harangues, than could be done by their reading the most inflammatory and seditious pamphlets; and it was surely much better to counteract seditious pamphlets, by their being able to read others of a contrary tendency, than to hire men to make speeches, in order to put down the effect of seditious harangues. If the government of a country were afraid of making the people enlightened and well informed, he really did not see how they could possibly stop short of wishing that they had no understandings at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Pole Carew</member> <membercontribution>objected to the clause relative to the purchasing, hiring, or erecting buildings for the purpose of giving the requisite instruction. He had been told that the poor's rates were ultimately to be lowered, by enlightening the lower orders of the people; but he was convinced it would have quite a contrary effect, and tend to nothing more than raising the poor's rates, and affording them an education beyond what their situations in life required. That education was certainly best which was nearest adapted to the particular sphere of each individual. Institutions for education were increasing daily, and he saw no occasion for increasing their number; the more especially as he thought small schools were more desirable than large ones; because, in the latter, immorality was more likely to be imbibed than morality and virtue. For these, and other reasons, he proposed to leave out the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0556"/>
<col>1051*</col>
words, "empowering magistrates to purchase or hire any buildings or lands whereupon to erect buildings for the purpose of schools."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>combated the arguments used in support of this amendment, as being totally destitute of foundation, and such as had already been refuted by every argument used upon the subject, either in that house or in any work that had been written upon it. It was an amendment which went absolutely to render the whole bill ineffectual. While the dangers of a refined education were talked of, gentlemen did not seem to recollect, that the education proposed by this bill was only the simple education of reading and writing. Whatever might be the sense of the house upon this amendment, he should own he was anxious such a bill should pass under legislative authority, to shew that parliament had decided that education was a good thing to be given, a proper thing to be obtained. It was a mistake for some members to suppose that this was a compulsory measure. Would the hon. gent. who recommended small schools in preference to large ones, propose to have 20 small schools instead of one large school, by way of limiting the expenses of the undertaking? He had stated, and he would still state, that it was his opinion it would be better to exalt the character of the labourer so as to make him independent of his fellow-creatures for his livelihood, and this was the mode ultimately to reduce the poor's rates. But whether there were poor's rates or not, he should ever contend that the instruction of the poor would be good, and would be one of the greatest boons their country could bestow upon them. When this subject was talked of, he could not help having Scotland always in his mind. What he had read of that country, and the inhabitants thereof, tended strongly to confirm him in the truth of what he had heard stated in that house concerning them.&#x2014;After some further conversation, this amendment was rejected without a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr, Pole Carew</member> <membercontribution>said, there were some passages in the preamble which he wished to be altered. He by no means approved the wording as it stood: "whereas, the instruction of youth tends most materially to the promoting of morality and virtue;' and the following passage we did not understand: "whereof we had a most convincing proof, by long experience, in that part of the united kingdom called Scotland." He though there was no proof of
<col>1052*</col>
this before the house, and therefore moved, that the said preamble be amended by striking out those passages.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>said, he differed with his hon. friend, as to the advantages to be derived to the public from this bill. The preamble mentioned instruction; but what sort of instruction? He by no means thought, that teaching the lower orders to read and write, would prove beneficial to the community at large. Scotland had been referred to as a proof of the great advantages resulting from ins ruction, but he did not think that prove any thing with regard to this country. He thought the character of the Scotch contributed more to obtain reading and wilting, than reading and writing to form the character of the Scotch. He should, therefore, approve of amending the preamble.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>would not consent to alter the preamble, which was the foundation of the bill. He had not expected that his right hon. friend would have been in the house, and he was altogether unprepared for his opposition. He was surprized and grieved that he should lend his great talents to those who seemed to think education an improper thing for the lower orders; but even against his great abilities he would engage to maintain, that education contributed to morality and virtue. He was astonished, that in a mind so enlightened, there should be a speck so dark. if he had not known that his right hon. friend was one of the most enlightened men of the age, he should really have supposed that he had heard another Jack Cade, who had accused lord Say and Sele of corrupting the minds of the people by introducing grammar-schools and printing, and verbs and nouns. When one opposed that for which he himself was remarkable, it was called "the Devil rebuking sin." We heard of mathematicians who thought mathematics the only desirable education&#x2014;of navigators who preferred navigation to every thing, and so forth; but here was a most remarkable thing&#x2014;a man of the greatest knowledge himself opposing the communication of knowledge. It was with pain and regret that he heard his right hon. friend, session after session, talking against the diffusion of knowledge. If he did not know him to be a man of most liberal mind, he should suppose he wished to be a monopolizer&#x2014;a regrater and forestaller of all talents and genius in his own person. For his part, he differed with him most widely on this head, and was for doing every
<image src="S1V0009P0I0557"/>
<col>1053*</col>
thing in his power in aid of that vital spark, which could not be taken away. He would wish to have men the dignified characters for which they were formed by nature, and for which they only wanted the assistance of education. He would wish them to know their duties, and to understand and value, as they ought, their rights. If the house rejected the preamble, they rejected the base, on which the whole stood, and if they rejected the base, they might as well reject the superstructure altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>said, he had heard the hon. gentleman with a considerable deal of astonishment, when he stated that if he deserted this part of the preamble, he should be deserting the whole superstructure of the bill. As to Scotland, he should ask him, had the house any proof to ascertain that such was the fact, as alleged in that preamble? Had there been any committee appointed, or was there any now to be appointed to investigate this matter, and to convince the house of the propriety of adopting such a clause? The right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham) did not appear to object so much to the principle of giving instruction to the people, as to the mode of doing so. Upon this subject he could say, that instruction was gaining ground by very rapid strides through the country, perhaps indeed too rapidly. Was the day labourer, he would ask, happier, for being instructed in reading and writing? Did the house not recollect the mutiny at the Nore? He might venture to state, from the information of an hon. admiral, that upon that occasion the mutineers had daily and nightly meetings on board of the ships; at which meetings they employed themselves in reading the newspapers and other publications; and that this tended much to the consequences which ensued. We are not, said sir Thomas, adverse to instructing the people, but there is a mode, and also an extent, to which their education ought to be carried. My humble opinion is, that this bill will lie as a dead letter upon the statute book, and not one parish out of fifty will ever act upon it. Certainly Scotland does form an exception, with respect to a system of education, but it can bear no analogy to the education of the people of England. The Scotch are a people that do not appear to be educates for remaining at home, they being in general inclined to move beyond their country. Then education would render them totally discontented, if they did not travel into other countries. If they re
<col>1054*</col>
mained in their own country, they would become extremely dissatisfied with their situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Macleod</member> <membercontribution>observed, that while he had heard one right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham)stating that he thought the good conduct of the people of Scotland proceeded entirely from their general character, and another hon. gent. ( Mr. Whitbread) arguing that it originated from their general good education, he was of opinion, that both of them might be said to be right. The schools in Scotland were like other schools, except that the masters had a salary fixed by the legislature. They had a maximum and a minimum of stipend, which was paid them by the farmers and the heritors. There were no parish rates in Scotland; but religion, he might venture to say, was the very foundation of the Scotch instruction. Before they were taught to write, they were completely taught to read their Bible. It was not, however, every person who was educated, that succeeded in life; but he never could conceive, after they were so grounded in religious ideas, as even to be able to repeat their bibles, that their reading and writing could be prejudicial to them. The schools were, in general, examined every year by the ministers of the church, or by the heritors. He thought that in England the bishop of the diocese should appoint a certain number of clergymen to examine the schools, and to watch that religion be the first and the last thing that is taught there.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>opposed, the arguments of the hon. baronet, and was sure, that when he examined his premises more accurately, he would find that they led to conclusions, to which he would by no means be willing to assent. What! was it to be an argument against the cultivation of our faculties, that those faculties might be abused? He contended strongly, against leaving out either the former or the latter part of the preamble, particularly the former, which contained a proposition, namely, "that the instruction of youth tended to morality and virtue," the omission of which, in his opinion, would be disgraceful, as after such repeated discussions it would appear, as if the house of commons had discovered its fallacy. Nor would he be willing to give up the latter part of the preamble, which referred to a country (Scotland) in which the multiplied advantages of education in the improvement of the character of a people, were most apparent. In his eagerness to pre
<image src="S1V0009P0I0558"/>
<col>1055*</col>
vent other people from learning to read the hon. baronet seemed to have abstained from reading himself: for if he had read the bill, he would have perceived that complete option was given to the poor whether they would allow their children to be instructed or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>supported the bill, and declared that he did not think knowledge too general, even among the higher orders. He dwelt with great praise on the plans of education in Scotland, but contended that Ireland was by no means an illiterate country, especially the south of it; he wished, however, that the benefits of instruction might be more generally diffused.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. P. Carew</member> <membercontribution>then moved an amendment that the allusion in the preamble to Scotland be omitted. A division ensued: For the amendment 28; against it 33; majority 5.&#x2014;On the motion for the third reading of e bill on Thursday,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>submitted to the hon. gent. (Mr. Whitbread), as there was little prospect of the bill's getting through the other house during the present session, if it would not be better to have it re-printed as amended, so that it might be resumed on the commencement of the next session, as a measure which had been approved of in that house, rather than as one which had been thrown out in another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>wished the bill to take its chance in the other house. If its progress was stopped in consequence of his majesty thinking it proper to prorogue parliament, that could not be regarded as a rejection, but as an unavoidable delay of the measure, which would again come forward with no worse grace than that which had formerly attended it.&#x2014;The third reading was accordingly fixed for Thursday.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[DELIVERY OF WRITS.] Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>rose to make his promised motion for leave to bring in a bill to amend the present mode of Delivering Writs for the election of members of the house of commons. He stated the inconveniencies of the present mode, and lamented that by refusing to hear the Messenger of the Great Seal at the bar of the house, had prevented him from proving his statements. He declared that at every election the messenger received from the treasury a list of those to whom they recommended that the writs should be sent. He did not peculiarly charge the present administration with this practice; it had been the custom with antecedent administrations. He hoped, however, that now the case was brought before parliament, they would not object
<col>1056*</col>
to the remedy being applied to it; and he doubted not that he should have the support of all those who were so warm on the sending of a private letter from a secretary of the treasury to his friend, in favour of a candidate. The plan he intended to introduce into his bill was as follows: that the writs as soon as issued should be delivered sealed by the messenger of the great seal to the secretary of the poet-office, who should be enjoined to forward them by the following mail to the postmaster of the county town of each county, and who should deliver a receipt for them to the messenger. The postmaster of each county town on the receipt of the writ should be enjoined to inform the sheriff of its arrival, and should return a receipt to the secretary of the post-office. On obtaining information of the arrival of the writ, the sheriff should be enjoined instantly to repair to the post-master, giving him a receipt on its delivery. By this plan three points would be gained; 1st, dispatch, for in 5 days a writ would reach the most distant part of the island; 2d, security, which would be provided for by the receipts given by the various parties through whose hands the writ passed; 3d, and above all, the utmost facility would be afforded to detection and remedy, if, either by accident or design, the writ should be diverted from its proper course. With regard to the perquisites which the messenger of the great seal had hitherto received on the delivery of writs he did not wish that they should be touched during the life of the person who at present held that office, for two reasons: 1st, because those perquisites had been regulated, at different periods, by authority; and, 2d, because the present officer had rectified many abuses, and had not put up the writs to a kind of public auction, in imitation of his predecessors. Should the house give him leave to bring in his bill, he should move for the appointment of a committee to examine into the fees and perquisites of the messenger of the great seal, for the purpose of introducing a clause into the bill in order to save the present officer from any loss. Alter his death, he was of opinion that these fees and perquisites might be abolished; at present they amounted, one year with another, to about 500<i>l.</i> a year. This might be charged on the consolidated fund, or put on the sheriffs' account. He concluded by moving for leave to bring in a bill to insure certainty and dispatch in the delivery of writs for the election of members of parliament.&#x2014;Leave granted.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[IRISH ARMS BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The order of the day having been read for the house to resolve itself into a committee on the Irish Arms bill, Mr. Long moved that the Speaker do leave the chair.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>would not oppose the motion for going into a committee, although the bill appeared to him to be so highly objectionable, so calculated to defeat the purposes which it had in view, and so alluring to the enemy to invade Ireland, that he did not think it possible to amend it in such a way as to render him friendly to the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Herbert</member> <membercontribution>reprobated the bill. He entered into a description of the state of Ireland, to show that the bill was unnecessary, and &#x00E1;mong other things mentioned, that in a Militia regiment, of which he had the honour of being second in command, four-fifths of the privates, half the non-commissioned officers, and six of the commissioned officers were Roman Catholics; but that no unpleasant circumstances whatever had thence arisen.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Long</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the clauses of this bill had made a part of the former Insurrection bill, and had only been changed for the purpose of mitigation. The bill had been prepared by the late attorney general for Ireland, and, if it was necessary six months ago, nothing had since occurred to make it less necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Elliot</member> <membercontribution>admitted that the draft of the bill had been prepared by order of the late government, but that the clauses had not been finally determined upon. Many of the clauses required modification, and if his hon. friend had not intimated his intention to propose the amendments he was to move, it would have been his duty to do so. At the same time, he must say that the late government would not hake taken upon themselves the responsibility for the state of Ireland, without the controul of this measure properly modified. For this reason, he should not oppose the speaker's leaving the chair.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ponsonby</member> <membercontribution>was not satisfied of the necessity of the measure and should therefore oppose its pi ogress in every stage.&#x2014;The House then resolved itself into the committee.&#x2014;A discussion then took place upon the clause for authorising magistrates from time to time to call for an inventory of the arms of persons, whom they may suspect of having arms illegally.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>contended, that this was a clause that gave magistrates the power of
<col>1058</col>
grievous oppression of the subject, in calling for the inventory of his arms from day to day.&#x2014;The clause was amended on the motion of Mr. W. so as to require the Magistrate to demand the inventory of arms by a requisition in writing under his hand, and to allow the party called upon to make affidavit of the truth of his inventory, before any Magistrate of the county, in which the party may reside.&#x2014;The next clause Mr. W. declared to be so tyrannical, that he doubted if any modification that could be made in it could reconcile him to it. The clause was, the one authorising magistrates and those authorised by the warrants of magistrates to search for concealed arms An amendment proposed by him was agreed to, authorising a magistrate to make search in person, in case of reasonable suspicion, but that no persons other than magistrates, shall make such search, except by warrant from two magistrates, such warrant not to be granted but upon information upon oath of one or more credible witnesses.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dillon</member> <membercontribution>proposed a further amendment, that no search should be made except between sun rising and sun setting; and if this amendment were to be resisted, he should propose that the magistrate should be present at the search.&#x2014;A long discussion took place upon this amendment, and upon another, which was proposed to be substituted for it by Mr. Dillon, namely, that the power of search should be confined to the proclaimed districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, that every modification of the Insurrection bill had only rendered its provisions more severe; and the same spirit seemed to be extended to the present bill. This measure was not only to operate on the disturbed counties, but on the peaceable districts, and was to become the most tyrannical law that ever insulted Ireland. The gentlemen of that country, possessing landed property, who held the magisterial office, were of great respectability; but it was notorious that magistrates, in a different condition of life, were selected for the purpose of carrying into execution such bills; and it was therefore of the highest importance to prevent oppression, from their misapplication.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Barry</member> <membercontribution>defended the Irish magistracy from the attack of his right hon. friend. If they were deserving of his representation, it must have been the fault of the late chancellor; and he appealed to an hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Ponsonby), whether the late chancellor had not required from the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0560"/>
<col>1059</col>
county members, and the governors of counties, characters of the persons in the commission of the peace, with a view to purify the magistracy of the county?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ponsonby</member> <membercontribution>declared, that the late chancellor had acted from a conscientious conviction that the magistracy wanted to be purged, and was prevented only by the late change.&#x2014;A division took place on the amendment, when the numbers were, for the amendment, 23; against it, 79. On our re-admission, the remaining clauses were gone through, and some new clauses added, the latter of which limits the duration of the bill to two years, and until the end of the then next session of parliament. After an amendment had been moved by sir J. Newport to limit the bill to one year, and until six weeks after the commencement of the then next session of parliament, which was negatived without a division, the house resumed, and the report was ordered to be received to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MILITIA TRANSFER BILL.]&#x2014; Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>moved the order of the day for the third reading of this bill. Mr. Windham, sir R. Williams, and Mr. Calcraft, put it to the noble lord whether he would press the 3d reading of such a bill at such an hour in the morning (one o'clock), when many gentlemen had left the house, under an impression that as the former business had extended to so late an hour, this question would not have been brought on. Lord Castlereagh could not consent to the delay solicited. Sir R. Williams moved, that the house do now adjourn. A division then took place: for the adjournment, 13; against it 71. On the re-admission of strangers, we found</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>on his legs, objecting in strong terms, to the pressing the 3d reading of the bill at that hour, and after so long and teazing a discussion as had taken place for the last eight hours, and conjured the house not to treat the country and the crisis with so indiscreet a levity, as to hurry forward at that late hour the third reading of a bill of such a questionable nature, and fraught with such momentous consequences.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>replied. He defied even the characteristic ingenuity of the right hon. gent. to start a novel idea in any discussion on the present bill, however prolonged. All that could be said by the right hon. gent. had been already exhausted and fully answered.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Calcraft</member> <membercontribution>vindicated the motives of his right hon. friend in wishing to defer the reading to a more seasonable opportunity, and moved that the house do now adjourn.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1060</col>
<p><member>The Speaker</member> <membercontribution>objected to putting the question of adjournment again without the intervention of a new subject. He had grounded his opinions on the precedents of the 12th of March, 1771, and 16th March, 1772. It had latterly been the usage of the house; but an usage that he had no scruple in saying was unfounded. He did not think the motion of the hon. member regular, and he should not, therefore, put it.&#x2014;The question was then put, that the bill be now read a third time; when, after a speech from lord Milton, against the principle of the bill, sir J Newport moved that, instead of the word "now," be inserted the words, "this "day;" upon which amendment the house divided: for the amendment 14; against it 75. Whilst strangers were excluded, we understood that another division took place of 12 and 74, when lord Castlereagh stated, that seeing gentlemen were determined to press amendment after amendment, and keep the house till to-morrow night, he should give them their way.&#x2014;The third reading was then postponed till this day.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[PROTEST AGAINST THE REJECTION OF THE OFFICES IN REVERSION BILL]</member>. <membercontribution>The order of the day being read for taking into consideration one of the standing orders of the house,</membercontribution> </p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>moved that the order for regulating the time of delivering in protests be read; which being read accordingly, his lordship observed that much inconvenience often arose from the early hour at which it was necessary to deliver in protests (at two o'clock p.m. after the debate.) A protest had been entered this day against a proceeding, which took place yesterday (the rejection of the offices in reversion bill), and the hurry with which it was drawn up, made him desirous to make a few alterations in it; with that view he should now move, that time be allowed till he sitting of the house to-morrow, to alter two passages in the second reason of the protest delivered in this day </membercontribution>.</p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>reminded the house, that this was an old established order, and that it had been uniformly observed with great strictness. It would therefore be for their lordships to consider whether it was necessary to dispense with it on the present occasion, where it was scarcely possible to add to the force of the reasons, and to the strength of the expressions which already

marked this protest.&#x2014; On the question being put, it was negatived without a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>had then only to say, that the time, he hoped, would come, not only when the reasons against such a proceeding might be fully expressed, but when the measure itself would be renewed, and carried, to the great satisfaction of the country.&#x2014; Upon the rejection of this motion, the following protest was entered.</membercontribution></p>
<p>"<membercontribution>Dissentient, because the protesting lords might be anxious to assign as a reason against the rejection of the bill, the assurances which were held out to the public, that the late dissolution of parliament was not suggested by his majesty's advisers for the purpose, nor should in its consequences have the effect of frustrating, or even interrupting the benefits likely to arise from the labours of the committee of finance. Assurances which in our opinion have been violated by the sudden and unexpected rejection of the bill.&#x2014; (Signed)Vassall Holland, Lauderdale, Cowper, Wentworth Fitzwilliam, Ponsonby, (Imohilly.)"</membercontribution></p>

<date format="1807-08-05">Wednesday, August 5.</date>
<p><member>[MILITIA TRANSFER BILL]</member>. <membercontribution>The order of the day for the third reading of this bill having been read,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Colonel Stanley</member> <membercontribution>took the opportunity of expressing his disapprobation of it; contending that the advantages which the line would derive from it, were by no means equal to the injuries which the militia, that great constitutional force, would sustain. He suspected that the Militia establishment was not a favourite with the present government, and yet they should not forget the zeal and spirit with which the Militia regiments volunteered their services to Ireland on a former occasion. He wished to know, from some of his majesty's ministers, whether it was their intention to go upon this system from time to time, and draft from the militia whenever they wanted recruits for the regular army? If it were so, it would become a serious consideration for the gentlemen who had already made great sacrifices, whether they were to continue long in the militia. For his part, it would be with an aching heart that he should part with those men who had grown perfect soldiers, who had formed an attachment to their officers, and whose officers were attached to them. He also wished to know, whether his majesty's ministers had hitherto given any directions to prevent officers of the line from 
<col>1062</col>
tampering with the soldiers of militia regiments? The reason he asked this question was, that he had received a letter from the lieut. colonel of the regiment he had the honour to command, stating, that from the moment it was first understood that recruiting was to be permitted from the militia, the officers of regular regiments had begun to tamper with the privates of the Lancashire militia, and also that drunkenness and want of discipline had commenced, which was to be expected in a few weeks.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>said, he had always stated that he conceived a periodical or annual drafting from the militia, would be destructive to that service, without producing a correspondent service to the army, as the regular ballot would increase very much the price of the bounty. As to the other point, he must say, that no such general orders had been given, and that he should have thought it presumptuous for ministers to advise such general orders, at least until one branch of the legislature should have agreed to the measure. The regular officers, however, who, contrary to their duty, should tamper with militia soldiers in the mean time, would probably gain nothing by acting in that incorrect manner. For example; if any officers, whose regiments were quartered near the Lancashire militia, expected that they would gain the soldiers who should volunteer from that regiment, they would probably find themselves mistaken, and that some regiment at a greater distance might be pointed out for those men to join.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir R. Williams</member> <membercontribution>observed, that if the bill had been brought forward early in the session, the sense of the people would have been so strongly expressed to their representatives, that it must have been rejected, and the gentlemen opposite must have lost their places. He blamed the eagerness with which ministers had subverted his right hon. friend's plan, which he contended, was every day improving in excellence; and remonstrated against the stigma thrown upon the militia, which amounted to an accusation that they were not fit to defend their country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr.Bankes</member> <membercontribution>gave his consent to the measure, not because he was blind to the inconveniences that must, in many cases result from it, but because, feeling in common with every member of the house the necessity of increasing the military force of the country, he did not consider himself warranted in opposing the bill for that purpose, proposed by his majesty's ministers, unless he could offer 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0562"/>
<col>1063</col>
something better in substitution. He stated the grounds of his approbation of the plan of his right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), and lamented that there were such fluctuations in many parts of the administration of the country, that that plan could not have fair play. It could not be denied that the ballot would be highly oppressive, and would materially injure, and for a time, destroy the recruiting for the regular army. To obviate this latter evil as much as possible, he thought it adviseable that the money given for substitutes should pass alone through the hands of government, and was, therefore desirous, that the fines should not be of such an amount as to preclude this course. The clause introduced in the committee giving the volunteers from the Militia to the line, the option of limited or unlimited service, met with his peculiar reprobation. It was with the most sincere regret that he found this bill was all that it was intended to propose, as he conceived that it was far from being adequate to the exigency of the country. His noble friend had recommended that further measures should be delayed to the next session, but was it certain that in the next session the opportunity of due deliberation would be afforded? Why the Training bill should not be put in force was to him utterly incomprehensible. It had never been considered as onerous, but if there were obstacles to its execution, he did not think it became parliament to separate until an attempt had been made to remove those obstacles. He rejoiced that the volunteer system was reviving, but some other body of force was required in the country, from which in case of invasion the regular army might be recruited. If ever there was any probability of an invasion, that probability had become much increased within the last two or three years. Every thing had occured to facilitate it, nothing to retard it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>opposed the bill. He considered, that not only the particular clause objected to, but the whole of the bill was directly hostile to the plan of his right hon. friend, which, he was convinced, was the best means hitherto prepared for the permanent support of our armies.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>General Loftus</member> <membercontribution>regretted that so much opposition had been given to this measure, which he maintained was highly expedient. The former Volunteers from the Militia had given to the army some of the best non-commissioned officers, and even adjutants, and he deprecated the wish to lock up men of similar character, from extending their so here of service.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1064</col>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>put it to the house to decide, who were right and who were wrong, in the circumstances which detained the house for such a length of time that morning. He appealed to what had just passed. Would it have been proper to have read the bill a third time, without having heard the discussion which had that evening taken place? Unquestionably not. The noble lord had declared, that the subject was exhausted: this was a considerable assumption on the part of any individual. If the forms of the house, and the state of the session allowed, plenty of new topics of objections would arise to the noble lord's bill. It was a standing dish. The house might, indeed, cut and come again. Whether any emergency existed, what was its nature, what measures were best calculated to meet it if it existed, whether this was one of those measures; these were considerations which demanded repeated inquiry. He denied that the number of men gained by the ballot, or rather the difference between that number and the number that would otherwise be gained by the regular recruiting, would in any degree compensate for the mischief that must result from the contest of bounties to the regular recruiting. Adverting to his own measure, he observed, that in the first three mouths of the last year, it had produced at the rate of 11,000 men a year; in the next three months, at the rate of 13,000 men; in the next three months, at the rate of 21,000 men; and in the last three months, at the rate of 24,000 men. Was there any reason for supposing, that this last was just the utmost that the measure could do, and that it would not have gone on increasing? When this result was considered, as combined with the effects which must have followed putting the Training bill into activity; the number that a perseverance in its plan must have produced, and regularly produced, would nearly have equalled the number proposed to be raised by the noble lord's plan, raised by an effort which must palsy all future exertions, After having thus maintained the superiority of his system in raising men, he entered into similar statements with respect to the diminution which it had occasioned, and which, if it had been persevered in, it unquestionably would have occasioned, in the number of desertions. The effect of the noble lord's plan on the Militia, had been described by the gentlemen who had spoken on that subject. For years to come, the Militia would not recover the blow of the noble lord. If it was once admitted that 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0563"/>
<col>1065</col>
we had a right to plunder the Militia, it was a mere mockery to say that a recurrence of the assumed necessity of plunder would not happen. With regard to the Training act, which would be the grand reservoir from which the regular army might be supplied, on the score of some difficulty in the execution, the noble lord proposed to postpone the consideration of it to the next session. What difficulty? None that he knew of, except the mistake of substituting the Militia lists instead of those originally proposed, the effects of which, however, had in a great measure been removed. He repeated his statements on the subject of the volunteers, and contended, that if, in case of invasion, it were attempted to bring a large body of volunteers to act with the line against some of the best troops in Europe, it would be a most ruinous proceeding, and one which he entered his solemn protest against. He contended this measure would be much more expensive than the former measure, and press as a most unequal tax upon the poor man, who would be ruined by the penalty of twenty pounds whilst his wife and family would be driven upon the parish. Of his own plan it could not be said that any part of it was a job. But when they considered the time, at which the present ministers took measures to court the volunteers, on the eve of a general election, the transaction would have much the appearance of one. Whatever the volunteers might do in a campaign against Buonaparte, they were an effective army in an election campaign. They were a good instrument, and the gentlemen opposite had, even when in opposition, played upon it. He looked upon the destruction of the late system, as having its full share in the object of the ministers in bringing forward this measure. His hon. friend had well said, that the clause introduced into the bill was of no use to it; but was he sure that the bill itself had not been introduced to receive the clause? The whole country was with the system brought forward last year, and certainly one half of it was against the present plan. Ministers had been in office many months without bringing forward this measure, till the session was nearly over, and many gentlemen had left town who would he desirous of discussing it. But the defeat of the Russians had produced an emergency to call for the measure. Had they not sagacity to foresee that event? They seemed to be in the situation of persons walking about in a pleasure ground and coming on what, in the language of modern gard-
<col>1066</col>
ening, is called a sunk-fence, but which, he remembered, used to be called, with reference to the exclamation of surprise that it was supposed to call forth, a ha! ha!. Ha! ha! said the hon. gentlemen, so the allies have been beat! I protest I never could have thought it. The French have actually been successful! could any one have looked for such an event? Then they are all confusion and bustle, the watch must be called, their rattles sprung, and next in regular order, the dismantling and breaking up of the militia. The measure adopted was calculated to break up all existing establishments; but he thanked God, that the system of last year had existed long enough to have a right judgement formed of it; and he should be satisfied to go down to posterity With no other claims to merit than that afforded, as compared with the systems of the right hon. gentlemen opposite. Like the eminent Italian musician, who had a piece of music inscribed on his tomb, or the Dutch mathematician who had a calculation for his epitaph, he should desire no other monument as a statesman than that system. He lamented the measure before the house, more from the effect it would have in destroying the existing system, the benefits of which had begun to be felt, than from any consideration personal to himself, or his hon. friends with whom he had shared in bringing forward that system. On these grounds, therefore, he protested against the present measure.&#x2014;A division then took place on the third reading. Ayes 76. Noes 19. Majority 57.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[MILITIA COMPLETION BILL.]</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;The Militia Completion bill was read a third time. On the question for passing the bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Pole Carew</member> <membercontribution>urged the propriety of forming a local militia not to be called out except in cases of imminent danger. With this militia he should like to see amalgamated as great a portion as possible of our volunteer force. He should wish the services of the regular militia to be extended to all parts of the empire. With these provisions we should be safe against any possible invasion. Notwithstanding the very general erection of fortifications there might be many exposed points. There should be depots of arms in central situations, in which a trained population would find a rallying point. The enemy, if he could assail us, would bring a force that would require all our means of defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>said, it was the fixed determination of his majesty's government to turn their attention to the formation of a large local militia, which was the measure 
<image src="S1V0009P0I0564"/>
<col>1067</col>
most essential to the permanent security of the country. He also promised attention to the formation of central depots. With a view to this object, under the able administration of lord Chatham at the head of the ordnance, a central depot had been formed (at Weedon Beck, in Northamptonshire), from which great facilities to the military service of the country had been found. In that noble lord's administration also, a wise system of defensive fortification had been adopted in Ireland as well as in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>had great satisfaction in hearing that it was intended to apply the attention of government to the amelioration of the militia. He hoped his majesty's government would at the same time turn its attention to the means of rendering the ballot less oppressive upon the lower orders of the community.&#x2014; The bill was then passed.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MINUTES.]</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;The Parochial School bill was read a third time and passed.&#x2014;Mr. R. Dundas observed, that when he had moved for the returns of the East India Company's Accounts, he had stated that it was his intention to move, that they should be referred to a committee of the whole house, with a view to a full discussion of the state of the accounts of the company, within the present session. Circumstances had however, since occurred, which rendered it impossible for him, or the house, to go into these accounts in detail this session. He should therefore be obliged to put off the business to next session. Nevertheless he should feel it his duty to move some Resolutions on the subject, and took that opportunity of giving notice of such motion for to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[RELIEF OF BENEFICED CLERGY.]&#x2014;Mr. Lockhart</member> <membercontribution>moved for leave to bring in a bill to suspend the act of the 35th of the king, so far as it relates to the voidance of Benefices held by clergymen, who may have subsequently accepted curacies augmented from queen Anne's bounty. The ground on which he rested his motion was, that many clergymen, not aware of the clause in that bill, which rendered benefices void in case the incumbents accepted augmented cures, had by accepting such curacies subjected themselves inadvertently and ignorantly to the penalty of that act. The consequence was, that the patrons of the benefices were threatening them with new presentations, and that they held such benefices wholly at the mercy of such patrons. His bill was
<col>1068</col>
not intended to alter the law or decide the right, but merely to suspend the operation of the act till next session, in order that the legislature might have an opportunity of considering whether clergymen under such circumstances ought to be left to hold their benefices at the mercy of the patrons, or to be deprived of them altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>would have great doubt of the propriety of the bill proposed by the hon. member, if it was to alter the law as it now stood, or to divest rights already vested by law. But as the bill was only to suspend the operation of the law now in force, till the subject might be more fully considered next session, he was not aware of any material objection to it.&#x2014;Leave was then given.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[ELECTION RECOGNIZANCE BILL.]&#x2014;Mr. Dent</member> <membercontribution>moved for leave to bring in a bill for better regulating Recognizances entered into upon Petitions on Controverted Elections. The 26th of the king, he stated, had not provided an adequate remedy against vexatious petitions. It required the principal in a petition to enter into a recognizance of &#x00A3;200 and each of the sureties into one of &#x00A3;100; but though it required the sureties to give in their residence, it did not require that of the principal, so that there was generally much difficulty to find him in the event of the recognizances being forfeited. It was to obviate this difficulty, and to discourage vexatious petitions, that he proposed to bring in his bill, which, when printed, he should suffer to lie over till next session. One of the provisions of the bill would be to require of the petitioner to deposit &#x00A3;200 with the barons of the exchequer, which sum would be to be returned, if the petition should not be declared frivolous, or, if it should, to be disposed of, one half to the sitting member, the other to his majesty. That some such provision was necessary, would appear from what had happened in the case of the borough he represented. There had been no contest there, and yet a petition had been maliciously presented against his return which had been signed by 5 persons, not one of whom was at that time within 200 miles of the place. One was a barber, another a common porter, a third a day-labourer, and a fourth a jack-ass driver, and all had been bribed to give their signatures to the petition. The necessity of the measure would also be obvious from the circumstance, that of the 54 petitions which had been presented in the last parliament, 18 had been abandoned without any recognizances having been
<image src="S1V0009P0I0565"/>
<col>1069</col>
entered into, and of the 31 petitions presented this parliament, 7 had already been given up for want of recognizances.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>could not help thinking that some regulation was necessary upon this subject. The practice of presenting vexatious petitions had become too frequent, and it was not proper that such libels upon the sitting members should be permitted. He hoped his hon. friend would take up the bill next session, when he assured him of his cordial support.&#x2014;The bill was then brought in and read a first time.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-08-07">Friday, August 7.</date>
<p><member>[EAST INDIA BUDGET.]&#x2014;Mr. R. Dundas</member> <membercontribution>rose, pursuant to notice, to move a resolution pledging the house to take into consideration early in the next session, the Accounts relative to the Revenue Charges and Commercial Concerns of the East India Company, presented on the 10th and 18th June last, commonly called, the Accounts of the East India Budget. It would be impossible in the present session to give to this subject the ample consideration to which it was entitled, and therefore he thought it better to postpone the statement and discussion till the next session. After some observations from Mr. Creevey, who reserved to himself the right of going into farther particulars than the mere East India Accounts, commonly called the India Budget, the resolutions were agreed to.&#x2014;On the motion of Mr. Dundas several additional papers, illustrative of the conduct of the government of India towards the Polygars were ordered, with the design of giving the fullest and fairest view of the Polygar question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Creevey</member> <membercontribution>stated, that when the Polygar question should come to be discussed, he meant to contend that the conduct of the British government to the Polygars had been the cause of the mutiny at Vellore; one of the regiments concerned, the second battalion of the 23d native infantry having been recruited in the Polygar country. On the promise of the right hon. gent. opposite to bring forward such accounts as had been, or should be received on that subject, and from a wish to await the arrival of those most materially interested in the transaction, he should not now offer the motion of which he had given notice for this day. He however gave notice, that early in the ensuing session, he should move that there be laid before the house copies of all letters written by marquis Cornwallis on the subject of the
<col>1070</col>
subsidiary treaties concluded by marquis Wellesley, and generally on the administration of India by that nobleman.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[ASSESSED TAXES BILL.]&#x2014;The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>rose pursuant to notice, to move for leave to bring in a bill for the better regulating the collection of the Assessed Taxes. As the bill was to lie over for consideration till the next session, he did not think it necessary to trouble the house, by entering into its details. One particular alteration in the existing practice he thought it necessary to notice. This was to divide the duties of the commissioners, and transfer them, so far as they were ministerial, to the subordinate officers. With respect to the collection of the taxes, it was intended, as no man could object to the payment of the taxes incident to the return he should give in, to authorise the collection of the taxes to that amount immediately leaving the taxes upon surcharges to abide the decisions upon the questions arising out of them. There was at present this evil, that the collection of the taxes, so far as they were certain and unquestionable, as they were on the returns made by the individuals taxed, was suspended, till the validity of the surcharges, which-were uncertain, was decided. He thought it necessary to point out this material alteration to particular attention, preparatory to the further consideration in the ensuing session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Barham</member> <membercontribution>wished a remedy could be provided for the great grievances that arose out of surcharges. The difficulty of finding redress in cases of vexatious surcharge was often very great, and sometimes it amounted to an absolute impossibility. He had himself obtained redress of such surcharges made upon him, but it was with great difficulty; and in some similar instances he knew several other persons to have totally failed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>believed, that the commissioners of taxes did every thing in their power to a facility of decision in cases of appeals on surcharge, and redress in cases of vexatious surcharge; but if any means of greater facility on these heads could be pointed out, he should be happy to give his aid in carrying it into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W Smith</member> <membercontribution>was afraid that the time was fast approaching when the officers in that department would necessarily be filled by men in the pay of government. He did not throw this Out invidiously, but certainly the abuses of the present mode of estimating and collecting the property tax was liable to and might ultimately render the tax itself not
<image src="S1V0009P0I0566"/>
<col>1071</col>
only intolerable, but not fit to be borne by the people. The fact was, that the majority of those officers were ever anxious to detect deficient estimates, not for the purpose of making the tax more productive to the nation, but that they might have their own share out of the surcharge.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>said, it was not intended to take away the powers now exercised by the commissioners; but merely to authorise the collection of the undisputed duties on the returns originally made, without awaiting the decision of the commissioners on the duties contested in the way of surcharge on appeal. It was impossible to obtain the supervision which was frequently necessary without allowing some interest to the person who detected the fraud; but when the surcharge was groundless the commissioners were always ready to afford relief, and when it was vexatious, to inflict punishment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. P. Moore</member> <membercontribution>was glad to hear that the bill was to be printed, so that members might be able to peruse it before next session. He hoped, however, that while pains were taken to make people understand the law by which they were taxed, they would also find that the payment of taxes was made easier to them. Of what utility, he would ask, were those numerous reports which were laid before the house, of every kind, if they were not acted upon for the public benefit? He hoped therefore that ministers would see to these things, before next session. As the representative of a large industrious city, he could say for his constituents, that they were ready to make any sacrifices for the public good, and to support their share in its splendour; yet they expected economy in the disposition of the national money, and that their distresses might be lessened. If these economical reports were heaped on the table without use, he should find it his duty to tell ministers that he would vote smaller supplies than he otherwise might have intended, were more frugality and attention shewn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>entirely agreed with the hon. gent. as to the necessity of economy at the present crisis, and a cautious expenditure of the public money. At the same time, he could not approve of the vague and incautious manner in which the hon. gent. had thought proper to fling out his charges. The remarks were of a nature so general and indefinite, that he did not know how to reply to them. If the hon. gent. had any thing definite to state in public or private, he should feel himself much obliged to the hon. gent. for such communi-
<col>1072</col>
cation. As to the reports which were said to be heaped upon the table, he wished the hon. gent. would again be more definite, and, selecting one or more from the number, state explicitly what he understood to be the existing abuse; this certainly would be much more satisfactory than dealing in loose and general observations.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. P. Moore</member> <membercontribution>said in explanation, that he alluded to the different reports in the various departments, civil, military, and marine, whereby it was obvious that there might be a saving by a more economical management in each, of the public money, to an amount of between five and ten millions annually.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>put it to his majesty's ministers, to consider the necessity and the means of affording a more immediate relief to the persons entitled to exemptions under the income tax: these persons were at present obliged to pay the full amount of the tax in the first instance, and they found it extremely difficult afterwards to obtain the relief allowed to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>stated, that he, as well as the hon. baronet, had received complaints of very severe hardships, in the manner in which the income tax was levied on the lower classes. He was sure if his noble friend (lord H. Petty) had continued in office, the necessary relief would have been afforded to the persons so pressed. He hoped the hon. gentlemen opposite would consider of the means of affording them some alleviation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>lamented, that in proportion as the property tax had been made more burthensome, the means of relief had been made more difficult in the cases in which no law could presume to withhold it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>stated it to have been his desire and intention, that every real grievance under the property tax, as it had been increased and regulated by him, should be satisfactorily redressed; but he thought it, in the first instance, desirable, that the whole of the provisions should have a fair trial; for it was only such a trial that could afford proof of the reality, or the futility, of the objections which were so universally made. He was desirous, now that a fair trial had been afforded, to give all proper relief, but he could assure the house, that much difficulty would be felt, when the means of giving that relief consistently with the produce of the tax should came to be considered.&#x2014;The motion for leave to bring in the bill was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[OFFICES IN REVERSION.]&#x2014;Mr. Bankes</member>,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0567"/>
<col>1073</col>
<membercontribution>in consequence of the notice he had given, rose to submit a motion, which he thought necessary as a preliminary step towards any proceeding which the house should think proper to adopt, with respect to the measure founded on a resolution of that house, which had been rejected in the other. The only way of bringing the rejection of the bill to prevent grants of Offices in Reversion in the upper house, before the view of this house, would be to appoint a committee to inspect the lords' Journals, as to what had been done there with respect to that bill. That Committee might report to-morrow, and on the report he should found a motion which be would submit to the house on Monday. He accordingly moved, "that a committee be appointed to inspect the Journals of the house of lords, with relation to the bill sent from this house to the lords, intituled, An Act to prohibit the granting of Offices in Reversion, or for joint lives, with benefit of survivorship; and to make report thereof to the house." A committee was appointed accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[CONSOLIDATED FUND BILL&#x2014;GENERAL STATE OF AFFAIRS.]</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;On the order of the day for the third reading of the Consolidated Fund bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>rose and observed, that as it seemed evident the session was about to close, he thought it his duty to make two or three remarks on the extraordinary situation of the country, at a period when ministers were about to prorogue parliament. The house had before them several notices of motions upon subjects of the greatest importance. The bills for the defence of the country were just gone up to the other house to be discussed there; and they had heard speeches from a noble lord (Castlereagh), stating that there were other measures necessary in his opinion, but which the session would be too short to enable him to introduce. A notice had also been given of a motion to consider the present trying situation of the West India planters, and a motion had been made to inspect the Lords' Journals, for the purpose of taking an important subject into consideration. He knew that we had just sent out a very large expedition, which it was supposed had not gone to any great distance, and from which, therefore, intelligence, it was to be presumed, might very soon be expected; and its results would be most important to the country, whether successful or otherwise. He knew also that a treaty had been concluded between Prussia, one of our allies, and France,
<col>1074</col>
the particulars of which were public; and that there was also a treaty signed between France and another of our allies, Russia, of the greatest consequence, but as yet unknown. From the terms of the treaty with Prussia, however, we learned that the emperor Alexander, who, it had been said, had acted with so much magnanimity, had consented to take a considerable portion of the territory of his late ally and friend the king of Prussia. The king of Sweden, our remaining ally, was confessedly in a most critical situation, and a British force was sent out to assist him. Under all these circumstances, and with the alarming state of the East India Company, almost in a state of impending ruin; with so extraordinary a vote of credit asked on account of large sums being wanted, in the probability of the volunteers being called out on permanent duty for several months, which portended an expectation of a speedy invasion, or appearance of the enemy upon the coast; under all these circumstances, he wanted to know what advice was given, or to be given by ministers to their sovereign, respecting a prorogation of parliament. He thought that ministers, who had advised the dissolution of the last parliament, were bound to counsel his majesty to keep the present parliament together, till time was afforded them to consider these various important subjects, which so much interested the country. He feared, that the very large vote of credit that had been taken was on the ground, not only of an intention to prorogue parliament soon, but also on a determination not to call it together again for a long time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>could not answer as to the time that knight elapse before parliament would be called together again: the first prorogation would he but for a short time, the subsequent prorogations would also be but for short periods, so as to afford a facility of early assemblage, if the exigency of affairs should require. The inconveniences with which a longer attendance of the members would be attended at the present season, was an irresistible reason for proroguing as soon as the state of public business would admit: along with the facility afforded by short prorogations from time to time to the assembling of parliament as soon as any particular occasion should render it necessary, the crown possessed the power of calling it together at any time at a fort night's notice.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>after the extraordinary vote of credit which had passed the house at an
<image src="S1V0009P0I0568"/>
<col>1075</col>
early hour of the morning on a former day, a vote exceeding in amount any former vote of credit, even those passed at times when there was a prospect of large continental cooperation, thought his hon. friend well warranted in making the observations he had made, and requiring the explanations he had demanded. From the unprecedented amount of the vote, and the strange time at which it had passed, the house ought to look narrowly to the appropriation of it. After what had happened on the continent, and after two months had elapsed of the period which was to be provided for, this diminution of the period, the exigencies of which were to be covered, ought to reduce, rather than increase the amount of the vote; yet, when his majesty's present ministers had added &#x00A3;1,300,000 to the public expenditure, they demanded still &#x00A3;700,000 more; and why? because it might be necessary to call out the volunteers on permanent duty. This would not be necessary except in case of invasion or alarm of invasion, when it seemed it was not thought that parliament should be assembled. These unprecedented sums were moreover voted entirely on confidence, and without any estimate whatsoever, and were proposed without any other object than to prevent the necessity of calling parliament together again for a long time. The vote of credit, asked by his majesty's late ministers, was intended to cover &#x00A3;800,000 arrears of subsidies, and to allow the means of contingent engagement with the continental powers. It was intended also to cover the great expences incurred in the Mediterranean; but, in the present instance, it was necessary that the house should look to a vote large beyond all precedent, and founded on no document, no statement, no calculation, and no determination. This being a money bill, he should take occasion to do justice to his noble friend now absent (lord Howick), who had been on a former night accused of having given pledges to the continental powers, and of having provided no means of carrying those pledges into effect. It was not his noble friend alone, nor his fellow ministers, that he was most anxious to vindicate from this charge of pledge and forfeiture, but the country, whose faith and honour would be tarnished, unless the imputation could be done away. His noble friend had enabled him to state precisely, with regard to the promise of aid held out to Sweden, that the engagement was not to take effect except in the event of a particular contingency. If the contingency should have arisen, the aid
<col>1076</col>
was to have been given in cavalry, in which species of force the Swedish army was deficient, and for which Pomerania afforded an excellent theatre. Means of conveyance could easily have been found at any time for that portion of cavalry that would be required in this service. But the contingency on which the aid was to be sent had never arisen. He left it to the house under these circumstances, whether any breach of faith could be imputed to the late government. It was not stated that there was any thing in the official documents left by his noble friend in the department over which he had presided; it was not stated that any thing had passed in any verbal communication of his noble friend with the ministers of the powers in question, which warranted the expectation of a general military aid on the part of the continental powers, much less any breach of faith in not having sent such aid. Nothing, in fact, had been done in the way of holding forth such aid, except the assurance to Sweden, which turned upon a contingency which had never occurred. He condemned the abrupt prorogation of parliament, at a time when so many measures were pending which required deliberate consideration and discussion. Suspension acts were passed with an indecent rapidity which ought never to be seen, even in the justest exercise of one of the most delicate functions of parliament, All these things, and the large vote of credit, indicated an intention of speedily separating parliament, and separating it for a long time. The house ought to look to the circumstances, and though these circumstances might have arisen from the late dissolution, the ministers whose act that dissolution was could not plead that excuse.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>was glad that the noble lord had confirmed what he had stated on a former night, so far as that a promise of aid had been held out to Sweden, and that such aid was to have been in cavalry. He did not understand what the noble lord meant, when he asserted that the contingency in which the aid was to have been given, had not occurred. Sweden certainly did think, that the contingency had occurred, and that the occasion was so far gone by, without the fulfilment of our engagement, that material injury had been suffered in consequence. Russia and Prussia also complained, that their interests had suffered materially from the neglect of sending the aid that had been promised. Though the cavalry was the most material part, infantry also was expected. But what entirely wrought the condem-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0569"/>
<col>1077</col>
nation of the late ministers was, that even if the contingency, on which the aid was to have been afforded, had in their own opinions arisen, they were completely disqualified from affording it, a great supply of tonnage being necessary for the conveyance of cavalry, and no such supply existing.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>called upon the house to observe the different statements of the hon. gentlemen when they made their first attack, and afterwards when they were pressed by facts. He appealed to the house, whether the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Secretary Canning) had not on a former night asserted, that when he came into office he was assailed by pressing solicitations and remonstrances from every quarter for military aid, the promise of which had been held forth. Now, it appeared that such a promise had been held forth to Sweden alone, and even that was incidental. It might be said, to be sure, that the remaining allied powers were cramped in their operations, in consequence of this aid being withheld from Sweden, and of that power being disabled from creating the intended diversion. That, perhaps, might literally make good the accusation brought by the right hon. gent.; but it was very far indeed from making it good in the spirit in which it had been urged by the right hon. gent. No promise had been made and forfeited. The contingency upon which the aid was to have been given, had not in his opinion, and that of his friends, occurred. The other powers, according to the statement of the right hon. secretary, asserted it did take place. In this contradiction, he should not think it wise to rely on the assertion of those who were interested in receiving the aid. The fairest standard would be to ask the right hon. gent. himself, whether, on the review of the papers in his office, such expectations were well founded? No attention was to be paid to the insinuations of neglected expectations and forfeited pledges, unless they took upon themselves to say, that in their own opinion, such expectations were directly held forth; otherwise he must contend, without allowing for the prejudice which he might feel, that the statement of his noble friend (lord Howick) was as much to be relied on as that of any other minister foreign or domestic. With respect to the charge of being unprepared for the contingency, if it had taken place, it was to be considered, that its approach would have been observed; for it was not to be supposed his majesty's late ministers would have suffered it to come by
<col>1078</col>
surprise upon them, as the present state of the continent had come upon the present ministers. He should have thought the assertion of the deficiency of preparation to meet the contingencies too bold. But there was this invitation to unauthorised boldness in this case, that the statement could not be contradicted, for it was impossible to fix the time at which the contingency could be said to have arisen. The late government had left in the hands of their successors, to the best of his recollection, 49 or 50,000 tons of sheathed transports, which was sufficient for the conveyance of 5000 or 6000 men. No offer of sheathed transports had been refused, and only the small transports, which could be always had on the moment, were discharged. Under these circumstances it could not be said that the late ministers were unprepared for the contingency on which aid was to be sent, in case that contingency had arisen. The facts of the existing supplies might be shewn by a comparative account from the Transport Board, of the amount of transports received and left by the late ministers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>was at a loss to conceive what advantage the right hon. gentlemen opposite proposed to derive from the renewal of this discussion. He was still more surprised to find that they conceived they had derived advantages from it. The right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham) could not assert any difference on his part from his former statement, for he had not yet spoken. He did say that great expectations of pecuniary and military aid from us were entertained by the allied powers. The expectations held out might have been excited, either by communications to his majesty's ministers here, to the ministers of the allied powers to his majesty's court, or they might be communicated by our resident ministers at the courts of the allied powers, in their conferences with the ministers of those powers. The course of the Foreign Office combined these two modes of transacting business. The hon. gentlemen opposite first threw out a general challenge to alledge any one particle of promise of aid, and then, when the promise to Sweden was cited, the noble lord opposite came down and confirmed the fact, and the rt. hon. gent. opposite triumphed in the conformation. He had now to re-state the fact with the high additional authority of the noble lord. The vague nature of a contingency, which one power could consider as arrived, and another as not arrived, warranted him in the argu-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0570"/>
<col>1079</col>
ment that to leave the terms of the arrangement. I gent undefined, was the sure way of exciting general and large expectations. He repeated, that great expectations of military aid were entertained, not only by Sweden, but by Russia and Prussia, and this latter power was warranted in the expectation by the British resident minister (lord Hutchinson). He would not say that this expectation went so far as to look for a British military force in the line of the Russian and Prussian armies. The objects Russia and Prussia sought for would be best promoted by the co-operation of on English force with Sweden, in creating a diversion on the rear of the French armies. As to the transports, he saw no objection to the production of the comparative accounts at the commencement of the late and the present administration; but it was not enough that the late government had left a large general supply of transports, as those employed on distant service, such as the expedition to Buenos Ayres and Egypt, were nothing to the present purpose. The point in question was the existence of a sufficient supply for transporting troops to the continent, if that should be judged necessary. He could not allow that no preparation ought to be made till the exigency should have arrived. He had heard of bold invaders who had burned their transports on effecting a landing, in order to render it more indispensable to conquer; but for a nation that intended to send assistance to omit providing transports, was the strangest proceeding ever known, and remained for the invention of the hon. gentlemen opposite to find out.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, said, he spoke particularly of transport tonnage immediately disposable for service, of which the late government had left more than it had received. No coppered ships had been refused; none had been discharged. He admitted that aid to Sweden might have Nerved Russia and Prussia. But what he complained of was the difference in the statements. The contingency could not come on without notice of its approach, unless the late ministers should have been surprised, as the present ministers admitted they were, by the events on the continent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Dr. Laurence</member> <membercontribution>defended the late ministers against the charge of holding forth expectations, and failing to fulfil them. If the expectations were held forth by our ministers to the court of Sweden, or our ministers to the other sovereigns, where were the instructions they had to do so? It was desirable that all the papers relating to the
<col>1080</col>
subject should be produced, and he saw no reason why they should not, as no inconvenience could arise from the publication of them as matters now stood on the continent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>asserted, that by the confession of the hon. gentlemen opposite, expectations had been entertained by the continental powers of assistance from this country. He had not admitted that the contingency had not arisen. It might be his opinion that it had arisen, but he put it hypothetically, whether it had or not, the late ministers had made no preparations for it. If, therefore, the contingency had arisen, they did not keep themselves in such a situation as to enable them to fulfil their promises.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, contended that no expectations had been held out, even upon the sheaving of the other side, which had not been performed. What then became of the exaggerated expectations and disappointments about which so much had been said?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir T. Turton</member> <membercontribution>observed, that if an additional sum was wanting, it might be in contemplation of a possible dispute with America, and insisted that if this country should be forced to a war with America, the late ministers had by their lenity, and too strong a bias for conciliation, given occasion to it, since they had treated with a pistol at their breasts. They ought to have insisted, in the first instance, that the Non-importation act should be repealed. If we should have a war with America, then, it was owing to their own concessions, and how could they oppose a grant which had arisen out of their own misconduct? Another reason for the enlarged credit might be the expences of the volunteer force. He hoped that this force would be put upon a more effective footing; that measures would be adoped for their better organization and discipline. We could not do without them, and it was requisite that we should have them in as perfect a state as possible. The country looked for this&#x2014;the volunteers themselves looked for it, and what he meant was some further authority to the officers, and encouragement to the men. He also thought the Training bill ought to be put in execution with all possible dispatch, for he considered the object of that bill as a sort of basket in a stage-coach. It had been said on the other side, that insinuations had been thrown out against them. Of all things that he had heard from ministers against their predecessors, it had been most unlike insinuation,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0571"/>
<col>1081</col>
It was directly charged that certain expectations had been raised in certain powers of the continent, that assistance was promised on a certain contingency, and if that contingency had happened, it was manifest from the state in which the transport service had been left, that the promise could not have been fulfilled. He did not say that it certainly appeared that the contingency had happened, although it appeared to be the opinion of some, that the contingency had happened; but at all events this was positively asserted, that in case the contingency had occurred, there were no means of carrying the promise into effect.&#x2014;When the situation of the country was considered, however, he hoped that all party differences would be laid aside, and that unanimity would every where prevail. With regard to peace he should approve of it, if procured on any conditions that would not compromise the honour and the security of the country. It had been said that France would have an opportunity of extending her preparations in time of peace, and that peace therefore was peculiarly dangerous. He considered this as absurd and ridiculous. Whatever advantages France could derive from peace, he was confident that this country would derive equal, if not superior advantages from it. If France should have resources in peace, we would have them also, at least in an equal degree; and therefore, he was of opinion that there could be no danger to us from peace upon that score.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert</member> <membercontribution>adverted to the outcry that had been raised some time ago about the want of employment for our shipping, which he considered as inconsistent with the present deliberations of ministers. They now seemed to intimate that it was impossible to procure shipping for a three months voyage at a short warning. Was this consistent with their former assertions? With regard to the promises that were said to be made to foreign powers, it appeared now that they had dwindled down to expectations on the part of our allies on the continent. This statement of expectations entertained on the other side of the water, were certainly very far from supporting the allegation of promises made on a former occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>maintained, that the statement of the ship owners, with respect to the shipping interest, had been perfectly correct, and that it was not inconsistent with the allegations, that transports could not be procured at a moment's warning. What his noble friend had said was, that there was no
<col>1082</col>
proper provision of transports for cavalry, which was the sort of force that had been promised. These could not be procured at a moment's warning. If an expectations had been raised in the minds of our allies, and no efforts had been made to counteract these expectations, he certainly could not perceive that they differed materially from a positive promise.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert</member> <membercontribution>in explanation said, that what he had stated was, that it had been asserted that promises had been made to our allies, and that these promises had now dwindled down to expectations, on one side, however unreasonable these expectations might be.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Hon. J. W. Ward</member> <membercontribution>adverted to what had been said by the hon. baronet under the gallery, respecting insinuations. Certainly, if it was asserted that expectations had been clearly held out of assistance upon certain contingencies, and these contingencies had happened and no assistance had been sent, the matter became a serious and heavy charge. The late ministers had unquestionably been guilty of a crime against this country and against Europe. But in this case, instead of bringing forward these things for the sake of adorning a speech, instead of introducing them in order to turn a period, a distinct motion ought to have been made on the subject, that the house might have an opportunity of passing sentence, upon a deliberate investigation of the affair and clear itself both to the country and to Europe. This was what he called upon ministers to do if they had any grounds for the charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the hon. bart. had been most unfortunate in alluding to America, while he was recommending unanimity; every word upon that subject was to be carefully avoided at present, and any allusion to it was most imprudent and dangerous. Ministers had certainly a most difficult and important task imposed upon them in this affair, and any allusions to the lenient proceedings of the late government, were very much out of time. He thought that the Training bill ought to be put in immediate execution, and all the measures for putting us in a proper state of defence forwarded without a moment's delay. He perfectly agreed in what had been said by the hon. bart. respecting the advantages of peace, and hoped that his opinions on that point would have the weight which they deserved.&#x2014;The bill was then passed. On the question as to the title of the bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the charges preferred by the right hon. secretary (Mr.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0572"/>
<col>1083</col>
Canning) against his noble relative (lord Howick) were of such magnitude, that he wished them to be distinctly stated. Was the charge specifically this, that the late administration had promised to the king of Sweden an assistance of cavalry on contingencies, and, when those contingencies occurred, the cavalry were not sent? This ought to be inquired into. The right hon. gent. had also stated hypothetically, that if contingencies had arisen, the late government would have been unable to fulfil their engagements. This ought also to be inquired into; for, if it could be proved that his noble friend had held out such promises, and violated them, he would be proved unfit for his situation, and in that case his crime ought to be known and punished. The right hon. gent. farther stated, that specific promises of assistance had been made to Sweden, Russia, and Prussia. He wished to know what promises to Sweden, except of money for augmenting her force&#x2014;a promise which had been carried into effect by the present administration. As to Prussia, it was known what had been granted by the late administration, and what by the present. Where was the promise violated? With regard to Russia, the only assistance demanded by her was to negociate a loan with this country, which the late administration refused, but which the right hon. gent. said, he should have acceded to. That this refusal was most wise, appeared to him to be indisputable. Let the country recollect the Austrian loan, and the sums which had been paid for giving facility to its negociation. As to any military assistance to Russia and Prussia, independent of Sweden, the right hon. gent. had reduced his accusation to a mere expectation entertained by those powers. On the whole, he thought it incumbent on the house to entertain the subject by itself on some specific day, that these accusations might be brought to a point, and that it might be known how far the late ministry were accessary to the recent disasters on the continent, and he hoped that the gentlemen opposite would afford the means of elucidating the subject by laying on the table the correspondence in their possession. The right hon. gent. stated, that one of our ministers abroad expressed his opinion that expectations of assistance had been excited. Did he mean lord Hutchinson? With regard to the assertions of those who were lately our allies, and who were now, he feared, our enemies, was it not likely that they would avail themselves of exaggerated statements against Eng-
<col>1084</col>
land, to endeavour to clear themselves from the odium of the transactions into which both, or at least one of those powers had recently been forced?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Secretary Canning</member> <membercontribution>explained what he had said the other evening on the subject of the Russian loan. A noble lord opposite (lord H. Petty) had declared his objection to such a measure in very strong terms, and all that he had stated was, that he was not so averse from it as the noble lord. Now, with respect to bringing the subjects which the hon. gent. had detailed in a distinct shape before parliament, for the purpose of calling for their judgment, he wished to know how they were to be brought forward. Were the gentlemen opposite to impute gross misconduct to his majesty's minister, by contrasting their proceedings with those of their predecessors, and were his majesty's ministers to be precluded from stating in defence of themselves their opinion of the proceedings of their predecessors, unless they originated a charge against them? He denied this. Besides, according to the hon. gent's. statement, these charges would amount to a solemn accusation of crime. All that had been said by him was, that the late government, though acting to the best of their judgment, had not acted for the benefit of the country. This had been extorted from his majesty's ministers in their own defence, and they were now called upon to make it the ground of a charge. If the exertions of the present ministers had been too late, they were bound to state that it was, because their predecessors had left them without the means of making earlier efforts.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>contended that the right hon. gent. had distinctly charged the late administation not with mere want of ability, but with a criminal violation of promise.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>observed, that when ministers made a charge, they ought to follow it up, because the documents were in their possession, and they could plead no excuse, except it was that the production of these documents would be attended with manifest injury to the interests of the country. Secrecy on this account might certainly be necessary; but he believed there was no such obstacle in the way in the present instance, nor, indeed, was any such alledged. The late ministers were ready to support their charge; if the present ones by way of answer to that, brought forward another charge, they ought to make it good, otherwise the house ought certainly to consider it as not made. He expected the noble lord would move for an
<image src="S1V0009P0I0573"/>
<col>1085</col>
account of the transports which the late government received at the time of their coming into office, and the numbers left at their going out of office.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the present discussion came with a very bad grace from an hon. gent. who had charged his majesty's ministers on a former occasion, with not having sooner sent to Sweden, or other parts of the continent, the force which was then embarking. Could ministers do less than state, that were their impressions ever so strong of the necessity of the measure, they had been precluded from an earlier recurrence to it, by the total neglect of their predecessors? No specific charge had been made, but it had been merely stated, that the late ministers were culpable in allowing expectations to grow up, and that one power (Sweden) had complained of the disappointment of those expectations. Adverting to the question of transports, he observed, that the interval between the wish to obtain transports, and the power of obtaining them, was much greater than what seemed generally to be imagined. Horse transports, in particular, could not be expected to be in the Downs in less than three weeks after the tenders had been accepted, and every one accustomed to these subjects, knew the tardiness with which those tenders were made. He thought the policy of the late government fundamentally wrong, that they had made up their minds to afford no assistance to the continental powers, and therefore, that they had managed badly to inspire expectations of assistance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>observed, that it now appeared that general promises had been first alledged; then a particular charge of a breach of engagement was made, and lastly the matter came round again to general promise. This was the dance that ministers led the house, all the while refusing the documents. The right hon. gent. had said that he had a right to retort on the late government. The best way, however, of answering charges was to refute them instead of retorting on others. But, granting his claim of retorting, he still contended that when the right hon. gent. alledged that the late ministers had adopted a particular line of policy, and had not acted up to it, he ought to be prepared with proof to make good his charge. When charges were brought against ministers, they had the means in their hands of refuting them if they could. When charges were made against them, they could only call upon the ministers to produce the
<col>1086</col>
documents on which they were founded. He himself was certainly of opinion that the Russian loan ought not to be negociated after the experience of the Austrian loan, though certainly there might be circumstances in which the Austrian loan ought not to be considered as a bar to any such loan in future. He hoped no more would be heard of the charge against the late ministers, or if it should again be insisted on he hoped the documents would be produced.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>said, it was clear that the fact was admitted, that ail expectation had been raised, at least in Sweden, of military aid from this country in cavalry, on certain contingencies. Whether or not those contingencies had occurred was a matter of opinion, and was not a subject on which a criminal charge could be preferred. Suppose the contingency had been that assistance would be afforded in case the allies were placed in such a situation as to be enabled to make a forward movement against the enemy. Was not this situation a matter of opinion? and might not one power assert, while another denied its existence? Whatever difference of opinion therefore there might be as to the policy of the late government, there certainly was no ground for a distinct criminal charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Folkestone</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the question was, whether a crime had been alledged, and whether the documents to prove it were produced? Ministers stated the crime, and refused to produce the documents. This was the ground of complaint. They alledged a clear fact that expectations had been raised. The right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning) was of opinion, that the contingency had happened. In such a case it was neither honest nor candid to refuse to bring the matter to the proof.&#x2014;The title of the bill was then read and agreed to. After which,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Castlereagh</member> <membercontribution>moved for accounts of the number of transports of different descriptions in the service of government at the time the late ministers came into office, and at the time they went out.&#x2014;Ordered.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH ARMS BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>On the order of the day that the Irish Arms bill be now read a third time,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Milton</member> <membercontribution>said he could not agree without any inquiry into the state of Ireland, to give his assent to the passing of such an arbitrary act as this. At the time of the union, the Irish were promised a full and fair participation of the rights of Englishmen; at that moment, after a lapse of 7
<image src="S1V0009P0I0574"/>
<col>1087</col>
years, they were called upon to pass an act than which nothing could be more arbitrary and oppressive, and which would not be borne with in England, but in cases of the most imperious necessity, and after the fullest inquiry. This could not fail to induce jealousies and suspicions among the Irish, and would, he feared, be productive of the most injurious consequences. It had been attempted to justify this act on the principle which had prevailed, in that of disarming the Highlanders, but there was a very great difference between them. The act for disarming the Highlanders was passed at a period, when no one could for a moment doubt the absolute necessity for it. It was immediately after a rebellion, in which those men had taken up arms in the cause of a prince, who was a declared enemy to the protestant religion, and whose ancestor had been expelled from this country, for his attempt to overturn the constitution. The hon. gent. who brought forward this bill called on the house to pass it into a law, without any document to prove the necessity of it, and without any means of conciliation having been adopted towards Ireland. He hoped, in a future session, to see some measure adopted in favour of the Irish; to see a modification of tithes seriously set about, and maturely and fully considered; and, above all, to see the catholic subjects of Ireland restored to their rights; "but," said the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, "the church is in danger." In what way this could be made out he was at a loss to see. Would catholic emancipation give the catholic clergy any greater force of arguments, as to the superiority of their religion? For his part, he saw no danger, unless it was caused by the protestants deserting the church. He protested against those restraining laws; they had for a great length of time been tried against Wales, and had always been found fruitless and nugatory. He had hoped the attempt to disarm New England, as we had done, would not so soon have been forgotten, but would have operated to restrain ministers from thus attempting to disarm Ireland. He had hoped, instead of this, that the Irish would be restored to their rights, and henceforward be allowed the rights of Englishmen. He objected warmly to the feelings of the Irish people being, at this moment, insulted, by the appointment of magistrates, who had shewn themselves to be party-men, and who were henceforward to be invested with the most arbitrary and oppressive powers. For these reasons, he
<col>1088</col>
should certainly vote against the bill being read a third time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lushington</member> <membercontribution>expressed his disapprobation of the measure, although he was sorry to learn, from what information he had received, that a necessity for it existed, and he particularly relied in this respect on the eloquent speech of a right hon. gent. (Mr. Grattan), who was so well acquainted with Ireland, and concerned for its interests. But he wished the bill had received sundry amendments, particularly for preventing magistrates, from breaking into dwelling-houses Of suspected persons by night; he also wished the duration of the bill to have been limited to one year. Upon the whole, it was a bill to which he felt compelled to give an unwilling assent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. P. Moore</member> <membercontribution>thought, that in a free country like England, such an act as this should never be passed but from extreme necessity. It had been said, that this act was justified by necessity; but there was no evidence in proof of it, except the opinion of a right hon. gent. (Mr. Grattan), which, however respectable that gentleman might be, he could not suffer to sway him, nor was he able to bring his conscience to adopt so arbitrary a measure on such authority. Such a corroding act as this must prove highly injurious in its consequences, by irritating and lacerating the feelings of the Irish people; and if there was a necessity for it, the fact was, it did not go far enough. For these reasons, he would move as an amendment, "that it be read a third time that day 3 months."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>apologized to the house for his again stating to them what were his opinions upon this measure. The importance of the subject, however, made it his duty to state in this, as well as in former stages, what was the result of his inquiry and deliberation upon a question of such magnitude. In the first place then, deferring as he did to the opinion of a right hon. gent. (Mr. Grattan), whose sentiments he always held in the highest estimation, he must confess that there was very high authority indeed in favour of the proposition, that some such measure ought to be adopted. But even then there was something which operated in his favour. That right hon. gent. whose opinion, it was admitted on all sides, carried such great weight and influence with it, did not say that he agreed to the bill with all its deformities; he objected to many parts of it; he only said, that rather than lose the measure
<image src="S1V0009P0I0575"/>
<col>1089</col>
altogether, he would agree to take it with these objectionable parts. However, when he looked at the consequences that were likely to result from the adoption of such a measure, he felt that it was his duty as a member of parliament in such a case, and without any specific evidence before him in support of the measure, to think for himself, and oppose the measure. This bill differed materially from the other; the other was to operate in a particular part only, and that under peculiar circumstances; but this was to act universally throughout the whole country, and under any circumstances. What was that in elect but stating that, generally speaking, you cannot trust the whole of the population of Ireland, and proclaiming to the enemy, that in that place there is to be found a large portion of his majesty's subjects who are ready to accept of their arms if they will send them there? But above all, he objected to the Measure because it was seen that even that most objectionable, most useless clause was not allowed to be altered, that which empowered constables or men of any description, with a warrant founded on suspicion only, to break into men's houses, and alarm and terrify their families in the dead hour of the night. If the search was only to be made in the presence of a justice, there might have been Some responsibility; but, when even that amendment was refused, when it was known, that whatever disaffection did exist, the arms were used by night, and that it was in the day time that they were mostly secreted, he could not he so prodigal of this insulting power, he could not bring himself to wanton thus unnecessarily with the feelings of the people. If he was not of opinion that the people of Ireland were better secured without than with this bill, he most certainly should vote in favour of it; but thinking as he did that the measure was both unjust and unnecessary, he was impelled by a sense of duty to support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir Arthur Piggott</member> <membercontribution>said he would beg leave, as shortly as possible, to give his reasons for dissenting from this bill. It was an act of the most arbitrary end oppressive nature, brought forward without any inquiry into the state of Ireland, without any evidence laid before the house as to the necessity of it; and it was altogether so unconstitutional an act, that nothing but extreme and most imperious necessity could possibly justify it. It did not depend on the responsibility of the lord lieutenant and council, nor on the authority of the established courts of
<col>1090</col>
law; but two magistrates could execute al the arbitrary provisions of this terrible bill He did not conceive himself authorised to give his assent to such a bill as this, on the authority of any hon. gentleman, however respectable he might be, both for character and talents; and notwithstanding all that had been said on the subject, he could not see any necessity whatever for it. Lord Hardwicke had resided upwards of 4 years in Ireland, a most able, dignified, and popular representative of his sovereign, during which time he had never found it necessary to resort to those extraordinary provisions. If so, what was there in the present state of Ireland to give occasion to this bill? Since my lord Hardwicke, the duke of Bedford had been some time lord lieutenant; and there were some partial disturbances in different parts of the country. Applications had been made to his grace to put in force the provisions of this act; but he refused. He proceeded against the culprits in a legal way; and the law was found sufficient to subdue the insurrection, and to punish the offenders. Here the house had the evidence of two lords lieutenants, that in the course of 6 or 7 years, there was no necessity for such provisions. It must be a necessity made apparent to parliament, and not allowed to go on in respect to any assertion of any individual, to put the whole people of Ireland out of the law, and authorize these nocturnal domiciliary visits. He was averse to the bill in toto. He never could reconcile himself to a bill which was to place the people, in every part of Ireland, in the power of any two rash, prejudiced, or intemperate magistrates, to break open their houses at any hour of the night, and, under the pretence of searching for arms, to alarm and insult their families, and without the slightest evidence of any necessity: and at least, if the house should agree to pass the bill, it ought to name the shortest possible duration, not longer, at farthest, than the commencement of the next session; when the subject might again be considered, and the law suffered to expire, unless the executive government of the country should think it necessary to he revived. It was said by the supporters of this bill, that it was to be continued for 3 years, in the first instance, because the revival of the subject in parliament, year after year, would excite irritation. So, that to avoid this suppositions consequence, the whole people of Ireland were to be 3 years exposed to the arbitrary oppression of magistrates and their under-

<col>1091</col>
lings, and to be deprived of their arms for the defence of their habitations. There were times heretofore, when a British parliament would not tolerate such language; and he thought it required some boldness for any minister to state such a proposition. Yet, how could the bill be continued 3 years, unless it was the united sense of parliament to resist any motion for its repeal, which it was competent for any member to propose in the next session? Would any member suppose it possible, that the affairs of Ireland must not come under the consideration of parliament every year? If bills like this were the boons to be granted to Ireland by this country, these were what they could find elsewhere; and if parliament did not see the wisdom of governing that country by lenient and conciliatory measures, and fulfilling to the hopes of the people the effects they were taught to expect from a legislative union with this country; namely, the knitting together their rights and interests with those of their British fellow-subjects; if parliament did not feel the necessity of strengthening, at this awful crisis, the armies of the empire, by the valour of a noble, brave, intrepid, and loyal people, instead of keeping up a system of coercive end irritative measures; he must only lament their blindness. This observation reminded him of a declaration once made by one of the ablest statesmen that ever presided over the destinies of this country, the great earl of Chatham; who said it was his maxim to adopt merit wherever he found it, free from all partiality or prejudice to countries. He had sought and found a brave people in the North, who had long been estranged from all attachment to British government by acts of impolicy and oppression, which transferred their affections to a foreign foe, who had flattered them with hopes of redress. He removed their oppressions. He noticed their loyalty to this country. They flocked to the British standard, and conquered for England in every quarter of the world. It was a similar policy that would give the best effects to the Union, by uniting with this country the affections of the Irish people: but a contrary conduct would tend ultimately, perhaps, to lop off the right arm from the British empire, at a moment when we wanted twice as many arms as we had to effect our security in this awful crisis. He concluded by beseeching the house, and his majesty's government, to depart from this fatal system which risked less than the ultimate lets of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1092</col>
<p><member>Mr. Dillon</member> <membercontribution>stated, that it fell within his own knowledge, that during the administration of the duke of Bedford, some hot headed magistrates had proclaimed a district contrary to law. They afterwards applied to the lord lieutenant to sanction their proceeding; he refused to do so, and the usual operation of the law was found to be sufficient for the preservation of public tranquillity. To such men it was not his inclination to confide such powers as were not found necessary in the administration of lord Hardwicke, and such as the duke of Bedford refused to sanction. It was the wish of lord Kilwarden, even in his dying moments, that the law should not be violated on his account. Ministers were well aware that by the Bill of Rights every British subject had a right to bear arms, and if unnecessary infractions of the best articles of the constitution were made as a matter of course almost, ministers might expect that some portion of the people of that country would declare their sentiments in the most open manner against such proceedings; they might expect, not that a revolution founded on Agrarian principles would be attempted, but that the higher class of the people would be roused, and that they would petition against the union. On the intended motion of Mr. Sheridan he should deliver his sentiments more fully; in the mean while however, he thought it his duty to oppose the bill now before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Craig</member> <membercontribution>defended Ireland from the unjust imputations against its loyalty and allegiance. He was convinced that the true policy in governing Ireland was to extend to its people the full participation of constitutional rights. He declared his conviction of the injustice and impolicy of the present bill, and strongly supported the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Ponsonby</member> <membercontribution>was a decided enemy to the bill. He hoped some amendment would have been admitted to render it less unpalatable, but he was severely disappointed. He thanked his right hon. and learned friend (sir A. Piggott) for his eloquent speech against the bill, in every word of which he agreed; and could only express his astonishment to find his majesty's ministers supporting such a measure upon hear say, and without a tittle of evidence, while at this moment the assizes of the different counties in Ireland were proceeding, and when the judges were every where unanimous in stating the tranquil state of that country, especially Wexford and Tipperary, the two most suspected counties, and where there
<image src="S1V0009P0I0577"/>
<col>1093</col>
was not a single indictment for insurrection, or even for seditious words; and when the judge emphatically thanked the grand juries for the tranquil state in which he found that part of the country. He never could give his support to so abominable, so unconstitutional, and so tyrannical a bill.&#x2014;A general cry of question! question!</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>expressed his astonishment at hearing so very general a call of question! question! as if gentlemen were in a hurry to pass a bill so alarming to the liberties of Ireland. He should not enter upon the affairs of that country at present, as he should have a more favourable opportunity, on the motion he should have the honour of proposing to the house on Monday. He did not expect, however, that on a measure like this for driving from the pale of the constitution the whole people of Ireland, his majesty's ministers would sit mute, without condescending to notice any of the arguments so eloquently and forcibly put against this bill. If ever he saw the case of Ireland treated with outrage and insult, it was upon the present occasion, when the king's ministers were forcing upon that country, a law subversive of all civil liberty, and exposing the habitation of every man in Ireland to the nocturnal intrusion of any two magistrates, or their underlings, on pretence of searching for arms, without any controul from the executive government. The eloquent speech of his right hon and learned friend (sir A. Piggott) was unanswerable. He gloried in the whole tenour of his arguments, and he was proud to see on that side of the house an attorney-general and solicitor-general of the last administration, stand forth as advocates for the cause of Ireland, who preferred government by Law to a government by arbitrary power and military execution, and who refused to vote away the liberties of a brave and honourable people, without any other semblance of necessity than the mere ipse dixit of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, and his legal friends the attorney and solicitor-generals. And what was the testimony of those right hon. gentlemen? Why, that none of them knew any thing about Ireland, but that they understood from good authority that there was a disposition to insurrection there. Who told them so? Did they learn it by any official document from the duke of Richmond? or was it only from the whispers of those hon. gentlemen from that side the water, who wished to feed their credulity? For gentlemen in their stations, to say they
<col>1094</col>
were unacquainted with the affairs of Ireland, might be well enough before the union; but after that event, such a declaration was as ridiculous as to say they knew nothing about Middlesex or Yorkshire. The former act, of which this was meant to be the companion, was abominable enough, but this was a thousand times worse. By a clause in this bill, nothing in the shape of a blacksmith must exist in Ireland but at the discretion of the magistrates, unless he would swear and give security that he would never make any thing in the shape of a pike. Thus every gentleman in Ireland was liable to be plundered out of his arms; and every blacksmith in that devoted country prevented from following his trade, or earning his livelihood, at the discretion of any two petty justices of the peace. Would any man, in his cool senses, suppose that such a measure was not calculated to excite universal discontent in Ireland; to convert the friends of the government, and the most loyal and peaceable people of the country into enemies, and to produce all those very mischiefs which it was avowedly directed to prevent? He should, however, beg leave to add to the bill a clause, by way of rider. It would be, to make it high treason to communicate to Napoleon emperor of the French, either of those bills; for he was convinced that such a communication would be the most direct, effectual, and traitorous communication to the enemy for the invasion of Ireland. The hon. and right hon. and learned gentlemen opposite to him took no notice of the speeches of his hon. friends; but if they were ignorant of the affairs of that country, knowledge should be forced upon them, or they ought to suffer for their ignorance. Notwithstanding the declaration of a right hon. friend of his (Mr. Grattan), and whose authority had been so generally quoted by the supporters of this and the former bill, he would not lend his conscience to any man against his conviction. The Irish security was gone upon the expedition to the Baltic; regiment after regiment was drawn from Ireland for foreign service; and now the country was to be garrisoned by two arbitrary acts of parliament. But surely if ministers were serious in believing the danger, this was the way to encourage and promote it.&#x2014;The house then divided, for the amendment 28, against it 80, majority 52.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord H. Petty</member> <membercontribution>then rose to move an amendment in the bill, by shortening the duration of it. He thought the house ought to be a jealous of such a bill as of the <ob/> act,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0578"/>
<col>1095</col>
and that it ought only to be past for one year. We ought to pay the same acknowledgement to the liberty of the subject in Ireland as in this country. We ought to anticipate that amelioration in the state of Ireland which might render the bill no longer necessary; and perhaps it ought also to be dreaded, that the Irish government would abuse the power vested in it, in such a manner as to make it doubtful whether more evil or good resulted from suffering such a bill to be continued. Thinking, therefore, that such powers ought to be only granted for one year, he concluded by moving as an amendment, that the words "one year" should be inserted instead of "three," as the duration of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>thought that it was necessary to say but little, when it was considered how fully both those bills had been already discussed. It would certainly be in the power of parliament to repeal this bill next year, if they thought it necessary; but he thought unnecessary discussion on this subject might be of an irritating nature, and could not possibly do any good.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>was rejoiced, that he had at length heard a few words from one of the hon. gentlemen on the other side. When they had before refused to argue the subject, on the ground of their ignorance, he gave them some credit for either modesty or candour. His noble friend had, however, obliged the rt. hon. gent. to say something. These discussions on the state of Ireland might appear to the gentlemen on the other side of the house, as irritating questions; they however appeared to him questions that ought not to be blinked, but that it was necessary to discuss fairly. He would tell the right hon. gent., that Ireland ought to be the constant subject of his thoughts, and of discussion in that house. The present bill Was a bill for suspending the liberties and the constitution of Ireland; and to prevent irritating discussions, as they were called, it was proposed, in the first instance, that the bill should be continued for 3 years. He could not see any argument that could be adduced in favour of continuing the bill for that time, that would not apply as well to the making it eternal. The right hon. gent. had said, that the house could repeal it next year, if they thought proper. This was most undoubtedly true, and so they could have done if the act had been at once made perpetual; but there was very little reason expect that it would be repealed before
<col>1096</col>
the time fixed for its expiration. If the bill were only annual, then the right hon. gent. must make out some kind of a case next year, before he could again propose it; but it it passed for 3 years, he would consider himself privileged to continue all that time as ignorant as he now professed himself of the state of Ireland. It was time for the house to take the situation of Ireland seriously into their consideration, as every body knew that the destruction of Ireland, or its occupation by the enemy, would be the downfal of the empire. He concluded by declaring, that he should support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W Elliot <memberconstituency>(late Secretary for Ireland)</memberconstituency></member> <membercontribution>admitted the necessity of this measure, but thought the period of duration quite another, question, and that parliament ought to show an anxiety to keep as much as possible within the limits of that necessity. He would, therefore, support the amendment, and would strongly advise gentlemen on the other side to accede to it. The right hon. gent. earnestly recommended the adoption of conciliatory measures with regard to Ireland. He deprecated the language which he had heard from a high authority in that house, and in another assembly also, with respect to the Catholics; for he considered such language extremely rash and imprudent, to say the least of it; as it would go to close the expectations, to put an end to the hopes of the Catholic body. When gentlemen talked of settling the question, what did they mean? Did they mean to say to a population growing in numbers, wealth, and consequence&#x2014;"we will never attend to your wishes, we will never comply with your desires?" But some gentlemen undertook to say, that the Catholic Question was of no consequence to this population. The contrary, however, was as true as nature was true to herself. What! that the landed and commercial interests, which had such extensive and just influence among the Catholic body, that the gentlemen of the bar, did not aspire to those privileges and distinctions, from which they were at present excluded! The idea Was quite preposterous. He could assure the house that gentlemen were mistaken who supposed that all those feelings did not prevail among the Catholics, which strongly bind men to the state. For the desire of participating, in those privileges which the state granted, was a strong bond of connection. He, of course, disliked, and would wish to discountenance the doctrine, that the prospect should be removed, which served to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0579"/>
<col>1097</col>
keep alive that desire. At least to allow the Catholics to hope, to let them cherish expectation, was one of the best means of preserving the tranquillity of Ireland. With a view effectually to restore and to maintain that tranquillity, the right hon. gent. mentioned the different measures which the late ministry had in contemplation; first, the grant of privileges to the Catholics; second, the modification of tythes; third, a strict attention to the appropriation of the funds destined for education; and fourth, the enforcement of the residence of the established clergy. These were among the benefits which the late administration meant to confer upon Ireland, and which he heartily wished to see adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member> <membercontribution>felt much satisfaction in hearing the objects which the right hon. gent. had just stated, and particularly with regard to tythes, in which it a change could be effected without injury to the interests of the established clergy, it was on all hands admitted to be extremely desirable. The hon. member expressed his wish that the gentlemen of Ireland would themselves devote their attention to a consideration of the means by which the state of the Irish people might be amended. For he could not help thinking that among that people, he meant the peasantry particularly, there was a difference not only in the civil condition, if he might so express himself, but in the political character, from that which appeared among the same classes in this country, and the gentlemen of Ireland might be most competent to judge of the fact, and to prepare the means of improving their countrymen.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>was glad to hear his right hon. friend state the objects which the late administration had in view, for the benefit of Ireland; and to those objects he wished particularly to point the attention of the house. So far from considering this bill and the Insurrection bill as twins, he thought them materially different. With respect to the consequence to be apprehended from the frequent discussion of measures of this nature, and which the right hon. gent. on the opposite side deprecated, he for himself thought, that as much irritation might be produced by silence as by discussion&#x2014;nay, more; and so he apprehended from the silence of ministers upon this occasion. The feelings of the people of Ireland must be grated to find it resolved to continue the duration of such a bill as this beyond a reasonable time, without any statement, and perhaps without the existence of necessity. For,
<col>1098</col>
whatever the necessity might be now, that necessity might be at an end within a 12 month. At all events, the ease was doubtful, and the Irish people should have the benefit of that doubt. Enacting the bill for one year did not preclude its revival, should it appear necessary, any more than the revival of the Mutiny bill, which, from the same considerations which actuated his mind upon this occasion, parliament had taken care to pass annually, although its necessity was undisputed and its principle unquestionable.&#x2014;The house then divided upon lord H Petty's amendment, and the numbers were Ayes 34; Noes 79.

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-08-08">Saturday, August 8.</date>
<p><member>[PUBLICANS' LICENSE BILL.] Mr Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>moved the second reading of this bill. He could adduce, he said, instances of the most atrocious oppression practised by the magistrates on individuals of this trade; he did not say designedly, but from carelessness and inattention. All that he wished was, that, when a publican was charged with an act which was to be esteemed sufficient to deprive him of his license, he should be informed of the nature of the crime imputed to him, and should be heard in his defence not that he and his family should be deprived of their livelihood by a whisper. This, he maintained, was not a situation in which an Englishman should be placed. It had, he believed, been objected against him, that this was the mode he had taken of canvassing Westminster. How truly this was alledged might be gathered from this simple fact, that one of the first measures moved by him in parliament was of a similar nature. Shortly after the riots in the year 1780, he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0580"/>
<col>1099</col>
himself originated a measure against the Westminster Justices, in which he had the satisfaction of being supported by a most respectable minority. Shortly after this, the late duke of Northumberland put an additional number of gentlemen into the commission of the peace, among the rest himself, (Mr. S.).&#x2014;General Fitzpatrick, lord R. Spencer, and other gentlemen on that side of the house, finding, during the immediately succeeding election for Westminster, that the publicans, through fear of the magistrates, all of whom were in the interest of government, could not be induced to open any houses in favour of Mr. Fox, though they had not previously qualified themselves as magistrates, they resolved to do so, and immediately advertised, promising their protection to such publicans is should act impartially by opening their houses for the independent candidate. In this determination they could only find one of the existing magistrates who would join them, and add his name to their corps. [A laugh from the ministerial benches.] Gentlemen, Mr. S. remarked, might, if they pleased, think it a subject of congratulation, and that it conferred honour and respectability on the magistracy of Westminster, that not more than one man could be found among them to add his name to a resolution expressive of their determination to act fairly and impartially. He had only stated this, however, to skew that the present was not an idea which he had now taken up for the first time. He had prepared a bill on the subject while he was Treasurer of the Navy; and so far was it from being an election trick on his part, that he did not mention the subject during the last election till the 12th day of the poll, whereas, had he meant it as a theme through which to court popularity, he would have set out with it from the beginning. If it was desired, he should be ready in the committee to go into a string of cases, the substantiating of any one of which, he was convinced, must render it impossible for gentlemen of honour, feeling, or humanity to doubt the propriety of what he proposed. He proceeded to state the case of a woman, whose father and mother had been for fifty years in one house, in which they had uniformly maintained an unblemished character. She had succeeded to her parents, and supported in it, with the same propriety, a family of 7 children, five of whom were entirely dependent on her industry. Being summoned before the magistrates, and informed that they could not renew her licence
<col>1100</col>
&#x2014;on her attempting to remonstrate, the only satisfaction she could procure was, "woman, you have had your answer." Her license was accordingly withdrawn, and she and her family are now reduced to a state of extreme poverty and distress. This case was not unknown to, and had attracted the commiseration of a noble lord and right hon. gent.&#x2014;But he (Mr. S.) denied that it was consistent with the constitution of this country that any man, in any profession, was to be told, that at the discretion of any one man, he and his family were to be deprived of their livelihood, and reduced to misery. He had, he declared, thirty instances of a similar kind, which he should, if required, bring forward in the committee. He had several instances too, of persons having been deprived of their licences for voting for sir Francis Burdett, for Middlesex. They had even been told that this was the reason; and, he would ask, were publicans, at the will of a magistrate, to be deprived of the free exercise of the elective franchise more than the other inhabitants of this country? He alluded to another case which had occurred at Fulham, where a house remarkable for the usual decorum of its keeper had been deprived of the licence, merely because on one occasion, a few Welsh girls returning to their own country had been indulged with a fiddle and a hop. These were arbitrary powers, which, he submitted, were not fit to rest with one or two individuals, without the person accused being acquainted with the charge against him, and allowed to defend himself. Neither, he maintained, was it even then fit that they should exist without appeal. All he asked was, that every person so accused should have the charge against him furnished to him in writing, and that he should be heard in his defence; and, afterwards, that he should have it in his power to appeal to the quarter sessions. He could not think it possible but that the magistrates themselves must be pleased that an appeal lay from their decision. If not actuated by personal motives, the knowledge of such appeal must be consolatory to their feelings. All he wished at present was that the bill should extend to Middlesex and Surrey. He confessed that he had received letters which would more than cover the table, containing similar complaints from every part of the country, so that he might be fortified in maintaining that the alteration should extend throughout. But still, high as was the respect in which he held Mr. Read, Mr. Graham., and one or two others of the. Westminster
<image src="S1V0009P0I0581"/>
<col>1101</col>
and Middlesex magistrates, he could not so far shut his eyes as to put them on a level with the independent country magistrates. The former held their places, for which they received an emolument, at the will and pleasure of his majesty's ministers; while the latter exercised a gratuitous and burdensome duty. There was another subject, which he had alluded to elsewhere, and before an auditory far more numerous than that which he had now the honour to address, namely, the power exercised by brewers over publicans, by being proprietors of public houses. With all the regard which he felt for many gentlemen connected in the brewing business, this was a practice which, he was aware, ought to be checked, if not abolished. Nothing was more clear than this, that brewers might meet together, agree that they would not interfere with the houses which were held under the dominion of each; and in that manner they had it in their power to impose whatever trash they pleased on the laborious part of the community. What they had after labour was of as much consequence to their health, and to their existence, as food. It was, therefore, an object well deserving the interference of the legislature, to see that improper means were not resorted to to disappoint them of it. The period of the session, however, would not allow time for so extensive a regulation. All that he now desired was to provide that a man, merely because he was a publican, should not be ruined, and his family turned on the parish, without having an opportunity of knowing what was charged against him. He concluded by moving, that the bill be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <member>said, he could only regret that the right hon. gent. had not brought not only the present bill but the whole of his measure sooner before the house. As he had it in full contemplation from the year 1780 down to the year 1784, he must regret that he should have allowed it to remain a blank from that period down to the election in 1807, when he revived it for the first time on the Hustings in Covent Garden; still more he must regret that he had been so late in the session in bringing it into the house. If the principle of the bill, however, was to be supported by cases, the plan would have been to move fora committee to investigate them, and to make the report of the committee the foundation of the bill. As matters stood there was no evidence to go on, and it would be unfair to make Middlesex and
<col>1102</col>
Surrey exceptions from a general rule. He hoped the right hon. gent. would set his mind to the business during the vacation, and come prepared with his whole plan early in the next session. He concluded by moving, that the Bill he read a second time this day three months.</member></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>thought some regulation necessary upon this subject, and bore testimony to the character of the publicans. From his connection with the revenue business, he was enabled to say, that there was not a more meritorious class of men than the publicans.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. D. Giddy</member> <membercontribution>vindicated the character of the magistracy in the country, who were, as far as his acquaintance extended, particularly in Cornwall, entitled to the utmost respect. The evils arising from the proprietorship of public houses being vested in the brewers, he acknowledged to be great, but he could not conceive any legislative remedy that could apply to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Peter Moore</member> <membercontribution>thought the grounds of objection stated by the chancellor of the exchequer might be obviated in a committee, where all the cases cited by his right hon. friend might, with many others, equally strong, be fully substantiated. From having had an opportunity of examining these cases, he could say that such instances of oppression had occurred under the existing law, as would revolt the feelings of the house, and as would excite its astonishment, that such a law had been so long suffered to continue in operation. However, as more inquiry seemed to be required upon this subject, and as gentlemen seemed to think the general extension of the principle desirable, he would recommend to his right hon. friend to withdraw the bill, rather than let it go to a division, lest its rejection should appear to imply that to which he was glad to perceive no gentleman was disposed, namely, an absolute opposition to the principle of the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member> <membercontribution>conceived a committee of inquiry necessary previous to the introduction of a bill of this nature, because it professed to rest upon particular cases; but if the measure were founded upon a general principle, comprehending the whole country, such a committee might be dispensed with. The hon. member was aware of the illegitimate use made of the power which the magistrates possessed under the existing law, of the improper manner in which they employed it upon elections, and that such, a law required revision. He knew that in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0582"/>
<col>1103</col>
some populous towns, at a distance from the metropolis, every publican voted at an election according to the will of the magistrate, in consequence of the undue influence derived from the existence of this law. He agreed, therefore, in the necessity which called for some correction of the abuse complained of; but he agreed also with those who considered it improper to have the grounds of objection which magistrates might feel to a publican's license become the subject of discussion in a court of law. For in that case be could not help thinking the remedy almost as bad as the evil. The mode of redress which occurred to his mind would be to extend authority for granting licenses or hearing appeals conferred upon a larger number of magistrates, who, from their number, would probably be free from the operation of local feeling or party prejudice. Thus justice might be done to the publicans and to the public, for whose interest, he thought that, if the principle of such a measure as this were unexceptionable, it ought to be extended to the whole country. He therefore recommended to the right hon. gent. to withdraw his bill for the present session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>professed his disposition to yield to whatever appeared to be the general wish of the house, and therefore he should comply with the request of his hon. friend (Mr. Moore), to any suggestion from whom he should be always happy to attend. At the same time he could not help noticeing the surprise expressed by the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, that he should have brought forward this bill at so late a period of the session. What, said Mr. S., the right hon. gent., who has surprised the house and the country so much himself &#x2014;he who has surprised the house at a late period of the session with his plan of government for Ireland&#x2014;who has surprised it with his new military project&#x2014;who has surprised it by proposing to suspend that highly laudable and universally praised system, the plan of enlisting for a limited time,&#x2014;and yet, that after all the right hon. gent. should talk to me about surprising the house! But, among all his surprises there is one surprise which he could not produce, namely that of surprising me by opposing this bill; for I expected it.&#x2014;The right hon, gent. proceeded to state the manner in which he had acted with a view to produce a satisfactory bill. First, he drew up a bill such as some gentlemen now professed to wish for, combining the case of brewers owning public-houses
<col>1104</col>
with that before the house respectively; but then objections arose, to which he yielded, in proposing to make those the objects of separate bills. Again, he proposed to make the bill general; but to this very great difficulties were suggested; he found many men, and magistrates particularly, who were willing to let him do what he pleased with Middlesex and Surrey, provided he let the remainder of the country alone. He therefore endeavoured to make a beginning of that reform in those counties, which so many gentlemen had professed to desire to extend to all England. But a committee of inquiry was required previous to the introduction of such a bill as this. He however, would beg those who desired such a committee, to reflect upon the expence and trouble that must attend such a committee; to consider if witnesses were to be summoned from all parts of England and Wales, what time such a committee must last, and when it was likely to end? Each case would, in fact, be a suit before the committee, for he should propose to do that with regard to the magistrates, which they, under the existing law, declined to do towards the publicans; that is, he should have the magistrates apprized of any ground of complaint urged against them, and afforded the opportunity of vindicating themselves. What time, then, would such an investigation occupy!&#x2014;As to the cases he had adverted to upon this occasion, the right hon. gent. stated that they were but a few out of a large mass, and while gentlemen called for deliberation and delay, he could assure them and the house, that many persons were starving in jail in consequence of the law which he proposed to correct. There was one case in particular into which he believed a right hon. gent. (Mr. Rose) had made inquiry, and which he knew was peculiarly oppressive, namely, that of Mrs. Unthank. The case of Mr. John Morris, a respectable man, who had a shop over the way in King Street, furnished the strongest grounds of complaint. This Mr. Morris, for whom, from his own knowledge of him, he could not hesitate to avow the utmost respect, was deprived of his licence by the magistrates, merely because his house was to be taken down in order to make some cox-combical improvements about Westminster Abbey&#x2014;to shew that building to the members as they came down to the house. But he had communicated the case of Mr. Morris to the Treasury, and he hoped for redress. There was also one with regard to a Mr.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0583"/>
<col>1105</col>
Bignall, of the Broadway Westminster, whose licence was withdrawn by the magistrates, upon grounds which they would not explain, and the poor man finding every effort to procure redress unavailing, absolutely died of a broken heart about a fortnight since leaving a helpless family to deplore his fate. With such facts before him, he did not think it too much to propose this temperate measure. However, as the opinion was so strongly expressed, that if such a bill was necessary, it should be made general, he should acquiesce in the wish for time to inquire into the subject. He hoped and trusted that by the next session, petitions would pour in from all quarters, praying the removal of the existing grievances, and that such petitions would be presented by the highest authority, by that of the county representatives of the respective petitioners. For himself, he should for the present only say, that which was only a repetition of what he had said before, that while he had a seat in that house, he should ever be found an advocate of the weak against the strong, and of the helpless against those who had the power, and, he was sorry to say, too often the will, to oppress them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>vindicated the conduct of the commissioners appointed to superintend the improvements alluded to by the right. hon. gent., from any concern in the transactions respecting Mr. Morris or Mrs. Unthank. For whenever those commissioners thought the removal of any house necessary to their object, they not only paid for the house itself, but, if a shop or place of business, they allowed for the good will also, or any other loss sustained by the proprietors.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>said, the complaint in the cases he referred to was, that the licence was refused on the ground that it was in contemplation to take down the house for the purpose of the improvement he had mentioned.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Huskisson</member> <membercontribution>said, that he had received some papers from the right hon. gent. upon the subject of Mr. Morris's case, and that an inquiry was set on foot in the proper department. The result of that inquiry he should take care to have communicated to the right hon. gent., and if the case should turn out to be such as the right hon. gent. had described it to be, he had no doubt that ample redress would be granted by remunerating Mr. Morris.&#x2014;After some farther conversation, Mr. Sheridan with leave of the house withdrew the bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[SCOTCH JUDICATURE BILL.]&#x2014;The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>presented a bill for the better administration of justice in Scotland, the object of which he briefly stated, namely to divide the court of session info two chambers, one consisting of the lord president and 7 judges, and the other of the lord justice clerk and 6 judges. His lordship stated, that he did not wish any proceeding should be had upon the bill this session, but merely that it should be printed and lie over for consideration next session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member> <membercontribution>thought it would be preferable to constitute the 6 justiciary lords of the court of session a court for the trial of jury causes, they being accustomed to trial by jury in criminal cases, and that the other nine judges should constitute a court of equity, with power to send causes for trial by jury into the other court.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> <membercontribution>declined going into the subject at present, but stated, that there were several petitions from different parts of Scotland, ready to be presented in favour of extending the trial by jury to that country.&#x2014;The bill was read a first time, and ordered to be printed.</membercontribution></p>

If, however he did not receive a satisfactory answer from ministers respecting the line of conduct intended to be adopted towards states at peace with this country, he should make a motion on the subject, on Thursday, which his lordship read, and the object of which was to recognize the principle of equality and reciprocity in the conduct of this country towards independent States with whom we were at peace.&#x2014;The lords were ordered to be summoned for Thursday.</membercontribution></p>

of the day being read for the second reading of this bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>observed, that it had been the wish of his majesty's ministers to have avoided, if possible, proposing any new military measure during the present session, in order that they might have had more experience of the effects of the plan proposed by a right hon. gent. in the other house (Mr. Windham), and adopted by parliament, and which it was their wish should have a fair trial. After, however, the events which had unfortunately occur red, it became incumbent upon ministers to propose some measure for increasing the military force of the country, in order still further to guard against the increased power of the enemy. He did not wish the country to believe, that, whatever had been the dangers of invasion, they were not now increased. Whilst at a former period, if the enemy failed in an attempt to invade our shores, the failure was sure to recoil upon the continent, and environ him with danger there; and when now, from the unfortunate situation of the continental powers, that expectation could not be indulged, at least only to a very limited extent, it could not be supposed that the danger of invasion had not increased. With these difficulties to encounter, ministers felt it their duty to propose to parliament an augmentation of the military force of the country. It was evident that a sufficient augmentation could not be obtained by ordinary recruiting, as that did little more than repair the annual waste of men; neither could it be obtained by any additional stimulus given by the new plan, as it appeared from the statement of the number of recruits obtained, that that number had rather diminished than increased, whilst the desertions, which it was confidently expected would be decreased, had on the contrary increased. No one, indeed, who supported that plan, had considered it as capable of producing a large increase of men immediately; but as calculated gradually to improve the army. That it was necessary to increase the regular force of the country there could be no doubt, as that must prove the substratum of the general force of the country. The militia and the volunteers were capable of rendering services to the country of great importance; and he thought the latter force had been most unwisely decried, as if it were said, that because such a force was not good for every thing, that, therefore, it was good for nothing. They on the contrary,
<col>1108</col>
were highly important parts of our force. It was, however, of the greatest importance to keep up and to increase the efficiency of our regular disposable force, and the most effectual mode of increasing that force was conceived by ministers to be the measure now proposed, by which 28,000 soldiers, already trained and disciplined, would be obtained by the regular army, and by which 56 second battalions, now very deficient in numbers, would be rendered efficient. He conceived this plan to be preferable to an army of reserve, in raising which a considerable period must elapse before the men could be at all fit for service. Besides, the unwise measure of remitting the fines incurred under a recent act for raising men, tended to destroy the effect of measures of this nature by discouraging activity. The noble lord then went over the different provisions of the bill, and contended in favour of the clause for allowing the men the option of enlisting for a limited or an unlimited period, that it would be highly impolitic that the terms of service of 28,000 men should all expire together; he, besides, was of opinion that the only fair principle upon which service for a limited period ought to be supported was, the giving the men an option of a similar nature. The noble lord alluded to the measures of ministers respecting the volunteers, and contended that inspecting officers were absolutely requisite to take care that the corps were maintained in a proper state of discipline, and to communicate with government upon the subject. The allowances had been also restored, the withholding of which, according to the plan of the late ministers, must have tended to the destruction of the volunteer force. He concluded by moving the second reading of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>said, that though he concurred in many of the sentiments expressed by the noble baron (lord Hawkesbury) who had just sat down, his mind had not been brought to the same conclusion, with respect to the measures of defence fit to be adopted at the present crisis; and this difference arose, in a great degree, from the different view he had taken of the crisis itself. It was indeed evident, independently of the avowal of the noble baron, that notwithstanding the unfortunate and decisive circumstances which attended the opening of the campaign on the continent (he alluded particularly to the fall of Dantzic) there was no intention on the part of government, at the time of the meeting of parliament, to propose any measures for the augmentation of our military force.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0585"/>
<col>1109</col>
No communication to that effect was contained in the speech from the throne, nor had the subject been at all adverted to by ministers at an early period of the session; and even now, the plan, which was at length brought forward, appeared to him, he was sorry to declare, ill adapted to our actual situation, and inadequate to the nature and magnitude of the danger. It was chiefly founded upon the expediency of increasing our disposable force, and upon the supposition, that, for a considerable time at least, there was no reason to expect an attack on the coasts of Great Britain or Ireland. Imperfectly informed, as he must necessarily be, he was nevertheless decidedly of opinion, that we could not be justified in acting upon such a supposition; and that, without losing sight of the expediency of increasing our disposable force, our leading object should be to provide effectually for our domestic security. For this purpose it was necessary, not only to resort to such additional measures, as were adapted to the immediate exigency, but to carry into effect. without further loss of time, the principle of the training act of the year 1803, which had been altered, but not, as he thought, improved, by an act of last year; and likewise to found upon the principle of that act, a permanent system, without which, we could not reasonably hope to be rendered completely secure against what ought now to be considered as a permanent danger. It was evident, from what he had said, that whilst he could not agree with ministers in their view of the species and degree of preparation which the crisis demanded, he differed still more from those who were of opinion, that, even at such a moment as the present, we ought to rely entirely and exclusively on the effects of the new, and, as he readily admitted, improved conditions of military service, which had been last year adopted by parliament, but which it was then distinctly acknowledged, were not likely to be attended with rapid success. This opinion surprised him, as coming from persons, not only of great talents and authority, but from persons who had themselves been forward, at an early period of the war, in complaining of the insufficiency of our military, force, for the purpose of domestic security. At the time when this complaint was most vehemently urged, there were in arms in the United Kingdom, between 6 and 700,000 men; of which number, 182,000 were regulars and militia (92,000 of the former description), 25,000 sea fencibles, and considerably more than 400,000
<col>1110</col>
volunteers. One of his majesty's principal secretaries of state (Mr. Yorke) had also brought forward measures, which were afterwards interrupted by the change of government, for adding 40,000 men to our disposable force, and he also laid upon the table of the house of commons, a classification and enrolment of 1,800,000 men; the whole, or any part of which, were liable to be trained and disciplined, and, in the event of invasion, to be required to supply vacancies in regiments of the line, or to be employed for the defence of the country, in any other manner that his majesty should direct. This force, upon which he should abstain from making any observation, was at that time called insufficient: but now, when the danger was enormously increased, by the increased dominion and power of the enemy, we were told that no extraordinary efforts were necessary, and that a new system of recruiting, wise, as he admitted, in principle, but confessedly slow in its operation, was the only resource, on which we ought to rely for the augmentation of a force, which, even previous to the late embarkations, did not exceed 168,000 men, and of which, 140,000, including 78,000 militia, would, he feared, at this time, be an exaggerated estimate. On the policy of sending a large part of our army at this moment, on a foreign expedition, he would, whilst the object of it must be supposed to be generally unknown, refrain from offering any other remark, than that, though offensive operations were undoubtedly, in some cases, the best species of defensive warfare, yet, under such circumstances as the present, it was obviously desirable, that the distance and nature of the service to which the force was to be applied, should not be such, as to render its return, within a short period of time, either hazardous or uncertain. Of the insufficiency of our domestic force at this moment, and even previous to the embarkations alluded to, he trusted that amongst their lordships there was no difference of opinion; and with a view to the safety of the country, he should rejoice to find, that they were equally convinced of the unfitness, as well as the inadequacy, of the means upon which they were now to decide. The necessity of extraordinary exertions being however assumed, the remaining question, respecting the best mode of acting, under the pressure of such a necessity, could not but be attended with great and peculiar difficulties. It was an undoubted fact, that there was no nation in the world, in which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0586"/>
<col>1111</col>
the disproportion between its population and the demands upon it for military service was so considerable, as Great Britain; and none, in which the obstacles to the supply of such a demand were so numerous and powerful. The degree of compulsion resorted to for this purpose in most other parts of the world, would be unwarrantable, under a free government, as long as the safety of the state could be otherwise provided for; and the ordinary inducements to enter into the army, are here counteracted by the strong attractions of the naval service, by the facility of procuring a comfortable subsistence in the various occupations and pursuits of civil life, and (in case of want of employment) by the certainty of provision, secured by the humane policy of our laws, and charged upon the landed property of the country. Under such circumstances, it is not to be wondered at, that ordinary inducements have been found inadequate: even the effect of high bounties has been proved to be inconsiderable: local and personal influence has indeed been more productive; and the consequences of the measures adopted last year, for shortening the necessary duration of military service, and for improving the situation and prospects of the soldier, had been such as to justify sanguine hopes of complete, though gradual success: but still he feared, that, to meet the present emergency, voluntary service ought not to be exclusively relied upon. He therefore concurred with those who were of opinion, that, for this purpose, some species of compulsion must be resorted to, and that, upon the whole, ballot was the most equitable, and least severe: on this point, therefore, his difference with ministers was not upon the principle itself, but upon the mode of applying it. The plan now before their lordships, was to encourage 28,000 men to volunteer into the line from the militia of Great Britain and Ireland, at present consisting of 78,000, and to raise by ballot 44,000, of which, 28,000 would eventually be wanted to supply vacancies: of the remaining 16,000, five were to provide against the loss of that number of ballotted men, whose period of service would expire in a few months; three to obviate the waste of three or four years, during which, ballot was to be suspended; and the remaining 8000 were to consist of an addition to the militia of Ireland: a measure which, when brought forward early in 1804 (combined with the acceptance of offers from several Irish militia regiments, to serve in Great
<col>1112</col>
Britain), had been strenuously opposed by persons who had themselves recommended it to Parliament in the ensuing year, and some of whom concurred in urging the adoption of it at this time. To this plan he objected on various grounds: he objected to it, because the very attempt to execute it, must necessarily be accompanied by circumstances, which even its warmest advocates could not fail to lament. Persons, whether ballotted men or substitutes, having entered into the militia, must suppose that they were not liable to be called upon to engage in any other military service: but being there, they are now to be tempted and importuned; their good and bad qualities worked upon; their spirit and loyalty piqued and flattered; their inclination to revelry and irregularity indulged and gratified; their subordination to their officers relaxed and suspended; and all this, to induce them to forego, voluntarily, as it is termed, their original conditions of service, and to enter into the line. Though this could not perhaps be justly deemed a breach of faith, it was not, he feared, strictly consistent with fair dealing! upon that account he felt a strong repugnance to it. He also objected to the measure on account of its uncertainty; for though it was probable that the men would be obtained, it was by no means clear that this would be the case; and nothing should be left to chance at such a time. But his objections to the plan were not so much founded upon the danger of its failure, as upon the consequences which were to be apprehended from its success. If effectual, it would deprive the militia, admitted to be now in the highest state of discipline, of 28,000 of its best and most active men; and with the residue, consisting of 50,000, were to be mixed and incorporated 44,000 recruits, whose ignorance and inexpertness would furnish constant employment, during a long interval, to the non-commissioned officers, and necessarily suspend the efficiency of the whole body of militia, for a considerable period of time, and under circumstances the most critical. But weighty as these considerations appeared to him to be, there were others not less important; he adverted particularly to those arising out of the situation in which this measure would place the officers of the militia; a description of persons who had strong claims to the respect and gratitude of their country. On two former, occasions they had surrendered their personal feelings to the exigency of the public service; and at those periods,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0587"/>
<col>1113</col>
when our domestic danger was far less, and when a sufficient number of troops could not otherwise be procured for foreign expeditions, then in contemplation, the militia furnished the means of carrying into effect the wishes and plans of government; but the injury to the militia service itself was immediate and lasting. In 1805, the measure of recruiting from the militia arose from other causes: in the preceding year it had been provided by Mr. Pitt's Additional Force bill, that the militia should not receive any further supply of men, till casualties had taken from it a number equal to that of the Supplementary militia; and accordingly, in the spring of 1805, when the hopes which had been entertained of a large increase of the army from the Additional Force bill were disappointed; when 500 officers had quitted the militia service; and when the number of privates was wasting unprofitably, the measure of permitting a proportion of the militia, equal to the supplementary part of it, to enter into the line, was resorted to, but, as it appeared from documents upon the table, with incomplete success. What, however, must be the feelings of officers on seeing a renewal of this measure, not under such circumstances as those which he had just described; not with a view to foreign expeditions, on which militia regiments could not be employed, but when that species of service was likely to arise, for which they were peculiarly and exclusively calculated, and with a view to which alone the militia was instituted, and could be said to exist; and when a hope might be indulged by the honourable and high-spirited individuals to whom he had adverted, that they should reap the noblest reward of their exertions and sacrifices in the peril and the glory of defending at the head of those whom they had trained and disciplined, the laws, liberties, and independence of their country? Under such circumstances, though their loyalty and patriotism would remain unshaken and unabated, their zeal, their ardour, their becoming pride as militia officers, must be checked and subdued; and if these bills should pass, the life and soul of that valuable and distinguished branch of our military system would, he feared, be extinguished for ever. These reflections were the more painful to him, as he was convinced that the consequences he had described would be unnecessarily produced; inasmuch as the object immediately in view might be accomplished by another measure, which had been sanctioned by experience
<col>1114</col>
and success; and to which not only no such objections, but no objections of equal validity, could be justly stated to apply. The description of force to which he adverted, was that which had been called the Army of Reserve; though, if its services were confined, as he should recommend, to Great Britain and Ireland, it might properly be denominated the militia of the United Kingdom. The success of such a measure might be deemed certain, as in the year 1803, immediately subsequent to a ballot for 90,000 men for the militia, it produced, within a month after the passing of the bill, 15,000 men; 25,000 in two months; and in four months, 37,000. It would be executed in the same mode, by the same lists, and by the same agency, as the measure of constituting the militia: the appointment of new officers was unnecessary, as the second battalions were now, or might soon be, in a state to receive the men as they were raised. It was marked by fair dealing, as it would be known beforehand that all persons serving in such corps would be encouraged to enter into the army for general service, and that, if they thought proper to do so, they would receive a bounty for that purpose. But it had been stated by the noble baron (lord Hawkesbury), that the process of training such a force would be slow, whereas the men volunteering from the militia would be already in a high state of discipline: the latter part of this proposition was an assumption without proof, and without the possibility of it: for it was not certain that the expected number would be procured at all; and it was evident that government did not rely upon procuring the full number from those now serving in the militia, as there was a clause in the bill, authorizing newly ballotted men and substitutes to enter into the line. But admitting that the whole number should volunteer, and that it should consist entirely of disciplined soldiers, the question was (and upon this issue he rested his view of the subject), whether the superior quality of men entering from time militia over an equal number in the Army of Reserve, was such as, on that account, to render it expedient to suspend during a considerable and most critical period, the efficiency of the whole body of militia, consisting of more than half of our domestic force, and to incur the risk of so wounding the feelings of honourable and high spirited men holding commissions in that service, and of creating such a distaste for it, as to shake and endanger the militia establishment
<image src="S1V0009P0I0588"/>
<col>1115</col>
itself. On this point he entertained no doubt whatever. He thought it obviously preferable to leave the militia entire and undisturbed, in its present high state of discipline, and instead of raising the men wanted at this time, by a circuitous, and, as it appeared to him, most objectionable process, to resort to a mode direct and certain, which bad been successfully tried under circumstances from which the present only differed in this respect, that the difficulty of carrying it into effect was then much greater, and the necessity of it considerably less. His lordship further stated it to be his opinion, that it would be desirable at this time to raise ten or twelve battalions upon a plan which had been successfully resorted to, upon a limited scale, in the year 1804, and which, but for the change of government, would have been carried to a greater extent. The plan to which he alluded, was that of trying the effect of personal and local influence, for the purpose of raising men for one step of rank: it differed materially from a measure adopted at an early period of the last war, as at that time almost any person might have acquired for the stipulated number of men, any military rank below that of colonel. By the measure he was now recommending, no individual would gain a step in the army, whose character was not free from imputation, and who was not of standing sufficient to allow him to obtain promotion by purchase. To this proposition he knew there were objections, but he had heard of none that appeared to him to be of sufficient weight to justify the rejection of it, under such circumstances as the present: as far as it went, it would lessen the number to be raised by ballot, which, he admitted, was a process not to be resorted to, except under the pressure of an urgent and overruling necessity.&#x2014;The noble viscount then proceeded to take a detailed view of the military establishment of the country, and expressed his decided opinion, that, as lord Hawkesbury had also observed, it must unavoidably consist of diversified materials, and of different descriptions of force; and that the necessity of compulsion could only be diminished by resorting to various methods, for the purpose of drawing from a disproportionate population as much military efficiency as could be obtained, consistently with the inclinations, the habits, and occupations of the people. The regular army must unquestionably be considered as the foundation, and, as it had been called by the noble baron, <i>the substratum</i> of the
<col>1116</col>
whole: for the supply of it, great confidence might, he thought, be justly placed in the measure adopted last year, for altering the conditions of military service: the benefits of this system could only be progressive; but they were already sufficient to warrant sanguine expectations of complete success. With this opinion, he greatly lamented the introduction of a clause in the present bill, affording to the militia soldier, on entering into the regular army, the option of serving either for seven years, or for life. A small increase of bounty would probably operate irresistibly at the moment of enlistment, and induce a large proportion to accept the latter alternative: repentance would speedily follow; all the uneasiness arising from contrast would be soon, and continually, felt: discontent and desertion, he feared, would ensue, and the advantages of the system would, in other respects, be circumscribed, and materially impaired. He was apprehensive too, that this clause might be the forerunner of a similar provision in the mutiny bill of the ensuing year; and if so, a system founded on the soundest principles and the most enlarged views, must be considered as abandoned and destroyed. This would extinguish the hope, now reasonably entertained, of our being enabled, at a future period, to supply and keep up a large regular army, by no other means than those of voluntary service. But, under the most favourable circumstances, a regular army, sufficient of itself to provide for our domestic defence, as well as for the security of our foreign possessions, could not possibly be raised and maintained; and, for reasons unnecessary now to be stated, ought not, as he thought, to be desired: auxiliary means must be resorted to, without which, in the event of a landing of the enemy in considerable force, effectual resistance would be hopeless. These means were partly to be derived from the zeal and spontaneous exertions of a large proportion of the community, and from the application of a principle solemnly established by the act of 1803, of the right of the state to demand the military services of all or any members of the community, for the purposes of domestic defence. Of the first description were the Volunteers, a force which, considering its amount and the spirit which produced it, is without a parallel in the history of the world. Of the disposition of government to cherish and encourage that spirit, he had the satisfaction of being perfectly convinced; and in general he approved of the measures which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0589"/>
<col>1117</col>
had been adopted for that purpose. In the management of the volunteers, it was essential to manifest a strong and liberal sense of their value; to avoid, and to discourage, unnecessary expense; and to aim at such a degree of military discipline and proficiency as may be consistent with a due attention to their ordinary civil occupations. Of the militia (a description of force raised under compulsory authority), he would add nothing to what he had already said, than that he believed it to be impossible that they should long continue to exist upon their present footing, but that they ought to know distinctly what they were to expect in future. The extension of their services to the whole of the United Kingdom could not, as the establishment was now constituted, be reasonably expected; and, indeed, without far more consideration and indulgence than for several years past it had been judged proper, or perhaps been found practicable to show, for the personal convenience and comfort of individuals belonging to the militia, it would be fruitless to hope that a large number of ballotted men would serve, or that the regiments would be officered by a considerable proportion of noblemen and gentlemen from the counties in which they were respectively raised. He was strongly inclined to think that the connexion of the militia with the volunteers, for the purpose of forming local and provincial corps, which should remain in their different counties, except in case of actual invasion, or immediate danger of it, would, upon the whole, be the most useful purpose to which those branches of our military system could now be applied. But all the means of defence and exertion, to which he had adverted, ought to be consisidered as far from commensurate with the exigency of the present crisis, and with the permanent danger, for such we ought now to deem it, against which it was our urgent duty to provide. For these purposes, it was indispensably necessary to exercise the authority solemnly confirmed to his majesty by the legislature in 1803, of calling upon all or any of his liege subjects, not only to assist in repelling an invading enemy, but previously to submit to such a course of training and discipline as would qualify them for active service in the field. Under such circumstances as the present, our actual and prepared means of defence should know no limits, bus those of our population: and considering the inestimable value of the stake for which we are contending, we cannot be justified, in suffering our internal pre-
<col>1118</col>
parations to be in any degree diminished by our confidence in our insular situation, or even in the undisputed superiority of our navy. Let our force at sea be what it may, whatever may be its distribution, it is well known, that no degree of skill, vigilance, or exertion, can ensure the confinement of the enemy in their own ports, and that it is also impossible to prevent their disembarkation in considerable numbers, on various parts of the coast of the United Kingdom. It is therefore necessary, for the purpose of being perfectly secure; of being, as far as human means can render us so, invulnerable, or at least invincible, that we should meet the enemy with what he cannot bring. He must find us an armed nation. With these impressions, it was to him a matter of astonishment and deep regret, to hear that the parliamentary measures, which, it appeared, were still necessary for carrying the plan for a general training into effect, were not to be proposed till the ensuing session; and it had been said, from official authority, in another place, that no danger was to be apprehended till the spring. It was indeed evident, from the conduct, the language, and measures of ministers, that they considered and treated the danger as remote: it might be so; but to delay, upon such a supposition, the adoption of measures confessedly essential to our security, was a species of confidence, to say the least, for which he was unable to conceive any rational pretence, or suggest any possible excuse. Was it founded upon the fact, that the great body of the French army was still in Poland? Let their lordships recollect the marches of the armies of France, in the autumn of 1805 and 1806. In 1805, they reached Ulm within a month from the time of their departure from Boulogne; and shortly after, 80,000 Austrians were prisoners of war. In 1806, they not only traversed in eight weeks, the vast tract of country between the banks of the Rhine and the Maine, and those of the Vistula, but crushed in their way, one of the greatest military powers in the world. The approach of autumn, or even of winter, would afford no security: on the contrary, long nights were favourable, when the object was to elude the vigilance or pursuit of a superior fleet; and it must be recollected, that it was the depth of winter, when General Hoche anchored in Bantry Bay. Let it not however be supposed, that France is at this moment destitute of means of making a formidable attack. Independently of her native troops,

<col>1119</col>
of which, the march of 60,000 had been stopped, 40,000 Dutch troops are returned to the frontiers of Holland, and a Spanish army, of 25,000 men, on their route towards Poland, had halted on the borders of France. These were circumstances, which surely called for the serious and immediate attention of ministers, and imposed upon them the urgent and imperious duty of making the most of the time yet allowed for preparation. This view of our situation might perhaps be considered as too gloomy; but he assured their lordships, that he had never yet been guilty of the crime of despairing of his country: and even under the present circumstances, his anxiety chiefly arose from the sentiments which government appeared to entertain of this momentous and unexampled crisis; and particularly from his conviction of the unfitness and inadequacy of the measures now brought forward; and not from any distrust of the actual sufficiency of our means to provide effectually for our security. We must however, by foresight, by vigour, by exertion, by perseverance, maintain ourselves on the eminence upon which we are now placed, or we should soon descend to the foot of the declivity, and in that state of humiliation, greater privations and sacrifices would be necessary, to enable us to make a comparatively feeble, and probably an ineffectual struggle, for our insular independence, than are now requisite, for the protection of our wide-spread dominion, and for the support of our formidable power. No plea, no pretence, for imperfect and incompetent measures, was to be found in the disposition of the people. They had not embarrassed the plans and operations of government, nor the deliberations of parliament, by complaints of the continuance of the war, and of the burdens which it had occasioned. On the contrary, their conduct had been highly honourable to the sound sense, the manly fortitude, and ardent loyalty of the country; and he was convinced, that, at the present moment, measures of efficiency and vigour, with a view to our domestic defence, would be hailed with approbation and joy by the united voice of the whole nation.&#x2014;On the present occasion, he had discharged what he considered as an indispensable duty. He had expressed sentiments, which he had long entertained, and upon which he had formerly acted. A slight difference of opinion would not induce him, upon such an occasion, and at such a period, to oppose a measure of the government: but he now did so,
<col>1120</col>
from a firm and conscientious conviction, that it was highly objectionable in itself, and that it impeded the adoption of other measures, far better adapted, in all respects, to our present situation, and to the permanent security of the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Boringdon</member> <membercontribution>contended, that there was every probability of the measure being effectual to the extent of the whole number of men sought to be raised. That these men, when transferred from the militia into the regulars, would be at least equal to what they were in the militia, that they would even be equal to most regular troops, he thought could hardly be denied. The noble viscount had said, that a long time must intervene before the deficiency produced by the draughting of them from the militia could be supplied. This was, in his opinion, the very point in which the present system was most efficient, and that in which it had the most decided advantage over the measure of the noble viscount. By the noble viscount's plan, the new levies would be formed into separate corps, consisting entirely of untrained men, By that now proposed, the 28,000 newly raised recruits were to be engrafted into 100 different battalions, into which they themselves would infuse additional vigour, and from whose almost complete state of training, on the other hand, they must be brought in a comparatively short period to the use of arms. He confessed there was one part of the bill he did not like, and that was the clause by which any infringement was made on the improved mode of recruiting the regular army, introduced during the last year. He should have preferred it had the period of limited service been still adopted, raising the bounty progressively, as 7 guineas for seven years, 8 guineas for eight years, 9 guineas for nine years, &amp;c.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord De Dunstanville </member>, <membercontribution>though he seldom found himself disposed to compliment the present ministers, could not refrain from giving them his thanks for any measure which went to add to the force of the country at this important crisis. To the mode, however, in which this additional force was sought to be raised, he felt himself called on to object. He would greatly prefer the measure recommended by the noble viscount; namely, the Army of Reserve. It had been tried, and found effectual. If, however, the present measure passed into a law, it should have his utmost assistance to give it effect; but at the same time it had not his approbation.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member> <membercontribution>rose and spoke nearly as follows:<sup>*</sup>&#x2014;My lords; Though I concur in many of the objections which have been stated to the particular provisions of the bill before us, yet I cannot consider these details as an interesting subject of discussion, when the measure is liable, in its very principles, to an objection of paramount importance&#x2014;I mean, that it is totally inadequate to the exigencies of the crisis in which we are placed. The noble secretary of state who moved the bill, has opened the subject with many forcible observations on the dangers with which we are surrounded, and on the necessity which we are under, of making extraordinary exertions, in consequence of the recent great successes of the enemy. But when the noble lord proceeded to specify the exertions, which he wishes the country to make, I could not help thinking the measures which he proposed, a strange contrast to the exordium of his speech. When the noble lord, after taking such ample time to consider the subject, brings forward a proposal prefaced with such observations, we are surely led to expect, that the preparations to be made, should be in some degree commensurate with the exigency, and with the amount of the force, which we may expect to be brought against us. But, supposing that the measure now proposed were free from all the particular objections which have been urged against it&#x2014;to what does it amount? All that is even proposed is, to raise 44,000 men in the course of twelve months; and that by a ballot, of which the acknowledged effect will be to impede and nearly to suspend the ordinary recruiting, by which in the same space of time at least one half of that number would be raised. The noble lord then considers an addition of 20 or 24,000 men to our regular and militia force, as a counterpoise to the increase of power, which France has obtained during the last three campaigns. With this additional number of men we are to be enabled to resist the gigantic power, which is now preparing to overwhelm us.&#x2014;Good heavens! my lords, is it possible that the noble secretary can be serious in making such a proposal? or are we to believe that his majesty's ministers have never at all reflected on the nature and amount of the danger with which we are menaced? Have they forgot that we have to contend with the most formidable military power, which the world has ever seen?&#x2014;that we have to contend single-handed, not

<col>1122</col>
against the power of France alone, but, I may almost say, against that of all Europe. Every resource, which the continent can afford, we may soon expect to see arrayed for the subjugation of this country; and all this immense power is in the hands of one, who is not apt to neglect his advantages. The conqueror who with such unexampled rapidity has crushed the most formidable powers on the continent&#x2014;he who has humbled Russia, who has laid Austria prostrate, and has scattered the legions of the great Frederick like dust before the wind, is preparing, with still increased resources, to carry his victorious arms into England, urged on by every motive that ambition and revenge can dictate. This island is now the only bar that stands between Napoleon and the empire of the world. He knows that when England is crushed, no other power on earth will dare to give him any further molestation;&#x2014;but that while England exists, he will ever have a jealous rival, a watchful and a formidable antagonist. Can we doubt, that every sinew will be stretched to accomplish the annihilation of a power, which has so repeatedly obstructed his views?&#x2014;Nor is it by ambition alone that he is animated. He makes no secret of the implacable hatred he bears to this country, and the vengeance which he meditates for the repeated mortifications, which he traces to the enmity of England. Assuredly, it is now no ordinary war that we have to wage&#x2014;no war of colonial contests or distant campaigns;&#x2014;the blow is now aimed it our heart&#x2014;our struggle is to be for the existence of Britain. It is not the humiliation of a rival that France now aims at,&#x2014;it is the annihilation of a foe, that, has for ages been the rallying point of her enemies. Nothing short of total and absolute conquest can now be expected to satisfy her ambition. To others the conqueror has shown moderation, only that he might direct his efforts with more security and effect against his main enemy. To others, he has shown moderation, only that he might the better accomplish our destruction. But if England be once at his feet, as Austria and Prussia have been&#x2014;never&#x2014;never will she be allowed to raise her head again. Calamities severe enough have followed the conquests of France in Italy, in Swisserland, in Holland; but the fate of these countries has been mildness itself, when compared with that which is now preparing for England. In these countries, ambition and avarice were the only motives to excess&#x2014;here they will be aggravated by rancorous vengeance, and national hatred, not confined to the com-

<col>1123</col>
manders alone, but extending to the lowest soldiers. Hitherto the French have been more or less restrained by motives of policy&#x2014;but if they conquer England, they may safely give a loose to every brutal passion; and the Englishman that survives the ruin of his country, must expect to see every horror, to which rapacity and insolence can prompt a licentious soldiery, and a jealous usurper.&#x2014;With such a prospect before us, from the gigantic power of the French empire,&#x2014;with the task of guarding against the destruction of every thing that is dear to us, his majesty's ministers are satisfied with an increase of 20 or 30,000 men to the army. Surely, my lords, when we consider the horrors to which any deficiency in our preparations may lead, it is the duty of those who conduct the affairs or the nation, to see that at all events our means of defence should be amply sufficient. Were the chance of successful invasion but as one to a hundred, it ought not to be neglected. Where we risk every thing, we should guard against the possibility of defeat, with as much solicitude as, in cases of ordinary concern, against the strongest probability. The noble secretary of state seems to entertain doubts as to the probability of an invasion being attempted: even if these doubts were well founded, to act upon any such presumption would be an unpardonable breach of duty. Though it were ever so improbable, yet if there is the slightest possibility, that by any concurrence of chances the enemy can make good their landing, we ought to be ready to meet them. To act otherwise would be to trust our existence to chance, and to throw away the security that is in our power.&#x2014;But, my lords, is the chance of invasion a mere possibility?&#x2014;When we look at the vast extension of the resources of France, at the means of, recruiting her navy, which she has acquired by her continental conquests, it would be blindness not to perceive, that her naval power must soon become far more formidable than it has ever yet been. France is now in possession of the finest forests it Europe, and of countries capable of affording ample supplies of every naval store: she may command the services of all the seamen which the continent can afford, from Memel to Cadiz, and from Cadiz to Constantinople. We may look too to the certain prospect, that the whole energy of the French government will now be directed to this object: we know in fact that during all the pressure of their continental wars, the most active exertions in ship-building have never been discontinued in their naval arsenals: they have now no other object to divide their at-
<col>1124</col>
tention; and we may be well assured that all the ability of the ruler of France will now be turned to naval affairs. The same genius, which has created such an astonishing change in the discipline and tactics of the French army, will now be unremittingly employed in the improvement of their navy; and if we recollect that the disorganized bands, which a few years ago were flying before Suwarrow out of Italy, are now the victorious legions of Austerlitz, of Jena, and of Friedland, we shall not be disposed to underrate the change, which the same genius may effect in the navy of France.&#x2014;We have therefore every reason to believe, that the naval superiority of England must ere long be exposed to a more severe contest, than any which it has recently had to maintain. Whatever confidence we may entertain in the valour and skill of our seamen, it is not the part of a prudent politician, under such circumstances, to overlook the possibility of our navy being worsted. This, my lords, is an event for which we ought to be prepared; and fortunately there is room to hope that we shall have sufficient time to prepare against it. But any one who considers well what the state of this country would be, if the French had obtained a superiority at sea, will certainly not be disposed to think, that we can begin too soon to provide against such an emergency.&#x2014;But, my lords, this is not all&#x2014;we have dangers more closely pressing upon us, dangers which if we are to meet, we have not a moment to lose.&#x2014;An invasion is certainly no impracticable undertaking for the French, even at this moment, notwithstanding all our actual superiority at sea. The ablest and most experienced naval officers have given their opinion of the practicability of the enemy landing in force on our shores. Repeated experience has proved the impossibility of effectually blockading the ports of the enemy, notwithstanding the greatest naval superiority; and when we consider the vast range of coast that is now under their influence&#x2014;a range which ere long may have no other limits than those of Europe itself, it is evident that we may be threatened at the same moment from so many different points, that it will be more difficult than ever to watch them all, and that thus the chances are greatly increased, of the enemy being able to convey an armament to the most vulnerable points of our empire. Our ablest admirals have repeatedly seen the French fleets escape from them, even when their whole vigilance was directed to the single port of Brest: But what would be the case, if armaments were ready at the same time in Cadiz, in Ferrol, in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0593"/>
<col>1125</col>
Rochefort, in Brest, in Cherbourg, in Flushing, in the Texel, in the Elbe, and perhaps even in Norway? What rational hope could be entertained that some one or other of them would not escape, and land either in England or in Ireland a force sufficient to put the existence of our empire on the hazard of the die?&#x2014;But why, my lords should I speak of armaments that are yet to be prepared? Have we forgotten that the enemy have already a most formidable one in full readiness, that they have only again to fill the camp of Boulogne to give us the most serious ground of alarm<sup>*</sup>? It may be admitted that the embarkation of an army to pass the channel, while our navy continues as superior as it now is, must be a hazardous undertaking; but we have every reason to believe that the attempt will be made in spite of every hazard. We know that our enemies are not very tender of the lives of their men; and though they were certain of the loss of one half of their army, they would not scruple on that account, it with the other half they can hope to accomplish their object. With such determination on their side, and taking into account the number of accidental circumstances which may favour their attempt, what are we to think of the blindness of those, who affect to treat this as a danger against which there is no need of guarding?&#x2014;Three years ago, when the French armies occupied the camp of Boulogne, our wisest statesmen were sensible that invasion was no empty threat, and England was all alive to the danger. Yet in comparison with the present time the danger was inconsiderable. The ruler of France, it he had then made the attempt, would have staked the existence of his power on the success of the enterprise. His authority in France was ill secured; his enemies without were formidable. He had unequivocally pledged himself to lead the expedition in person; and even if he had not,
<quote><sup>*</sup>It has been the fashion to treat the preparations of the enemy in that quarter as a subject of derision: but some of the ablest of our naval officers have considered them in a very different light. Some details as to the nature and powers of the flotilla might here be stated, upon authority of the first eminence, and they are withheld only from prudential considerations, and from the apprehension that information might thereby be conveyd to the enemy. Were it not for this restraint, these particulars might be sufficient to convince the most sceptical of the danger of immediate invasion, perhaps in the very face of our fleet, but at least under circumstances, the occurrence of which could not be prevented by the utmost vigilance on the part of our commanders.</quote>
<col>1126</col>
the undertaking was too great to be delegated. An unfortunate result, though it had not been fatal to his person, would have occasioned a counter-revolution in France; and even a doubtful contest would have drawn upon him a dangerous attack from the continental powers. In the present circumstances, all these obstacles are removed. Napoleon has reaped an ample harvest of glory, and may now afford to delegate the conquest of England to some of his generals. He may take that course, without appearing to imply any doubt of its success, or any wish to avoid personal danger. The continental powers are so completely crushed, that there is no reason to apprehend any obstruction on their part; and the power of Bonaparte in France is so confirmed, that even the failure of the expedition to England would not shake it. When he has so little to apprehend from an unfortunate result, and when the effect of success will be to confirm Napoleon as the master of the world, have we not every reason to suppose that the greatest hazard will be run for such a prize?&#x2014;ln those who shut their eyes against the danger of immediate invasion, there is something like absolute infatuation. Because our enemy is at a distance, and has for a while had his back turned to us, we seem to imagine, that he can never again threaten our shores. His army indeed is now on the banks of the Vistula:&#x2014;But have we forgot the rapidity with which he moved from Boulogne to Vienna, and from the Rhine to Berlin? Nor are France and the adjacent provinces left so entirely destitute of troops, but that a week or two, perhaps, would be sufficient to collect again at Boulogne, such a force as might be sufficient for the invasion. Even before the next winter sets in, it is not impossible that a French army may be on English ground; and if the blow is delayed, it will only be that it may be struck with greater certainty. Under these circumstances, not only is the nation sunk in apathy; but his majesty's ministers, setting the example of blind insensibility, are not ashamed of bringing forward such a proposition as the bill before us, telling the nation that 20 or 30,000 more troops are to ensure their security.&#x2014;If ever, my lords, there was an example of that infatuation which seems to be the natural forerunner of the fall of empires, is not this one? In what are we more wise than the Prussians, who, a year ago, rushed headlongon destruction, and would not believe in the possibility of defeat? They thought that the legions of the great Frederick were invincible, as we seem now to think that the channel is an
<image src="S1V0009P0I0594"/>
<col>1127</col>
impassable barrier. Will no experience teach us wisdom? and is England destined to afford another terrible example that "quos Deus vult perdere, pri&#x00F9;s dementat?"&#x2014;Let us rouse, my lords, from this, fatal security: let us trust no longer to a barrier that may be overcome. It is not to the channel that we must look for security, but to the hands of Englishmen fighting for their liberties, for the glory and the independence of their country. To put our trust in the sea, if it were not the extreme of folly, would be the extreme of cowardice. Shall the descendants of the men, who conquered at Agincourt and at Cressy, acknowledge that they cannot meet the armies of France hand to hand, and that it is only at sea that we can cope with our enemies? Away with the base idea, that England must entrench herfelt behind a miserable ditch, instead of coming out into the field! Let us look the danger in the face, and prepare for our defence, as if the cliffs of Dover touched those of Calais, or as if the fleets of France had been as victorious as her armies. Till we can hear without dismay that the flotilla of Boulogne has effected a landing on the coast of Kent; that a French army of 120,000 men are in possession of Dover, and that 20 or 30,000 more have made their way to Ireland&#x2014;till we can hear all this without a well-grounded apprehension, I shall not consider the state of our defence as worthy of the name of England. The probability is, that a year may not elapse before such news will reach our ears: and when it does come upon us, what consequence can any reasonable man anticipate if our state of defence remain such as it now is, or such as it will be, with all the addition which his majesty's ministers now call for? Let any man of military knowledge, who is acquainted with the present situation and disposition of our regular and militia force, calculate the time regular would be necessary for bringing together an army capable of opposing 100,000, or even half that number, of the troops of Bonaparte, flushed with all their late astonishing successes. Let him look back to the rapid marches of these troops in the campaigns of 1805 and 1806, and let him figure to himself what their movement would probably be, were they at this hour landed on the shores of England. Let him say, whether the enemy might not be in possession of London, and of all our military dep&#x00F4;ts, before our army could even be collected? whether, advancing with his usual rapidity into the centre of the country, he might not intercept our scattered battalions before they could reach a rendezvous, or
<col>1128</col>
from the semblance of an army fit to oppose him&#x2014;Last year, we saw Prussia over-whelmed after a short and feeble resistance: Heaven grant that England may not shortly exhibit a parallel, or a still more disgraceful spectacle! Prussia at least fought a battle before she submitted to the conqueror&#x2014;England may probably be overrun, before her army is even in readiness to take the field and to face the invader; and this far-famed empire may be crushed, without our having the glory of making, one stand for the liberties we value so highly!&#x2014;Great, my lords, as the dangers are, with which this country is now surrounded, nothing is farther from my mind than to say, that the contest is beyond our strength, or that the resources of this country, if well directed, are not adequate to meet all its dangers. But if that is to be done, it must be by very different measures from this that is now before us, and by exertions of which Englishmen have as yet been little accustomed to think.&#x2014;In considering the means of resisting the now gigantic extent of the power of France, there is one point abundantly evident, that something more than a standing army, or any description of regular force, is absolutely necessary. I am perfectly sensible, that a strong regular army must be the basis of our defence; that every other description of force can only serve as accessories; that, without a large army, nothing can be done by volunteers, or any similar local force, or by any exertion of the zeal and courage of the civil population of the kingdom. On the other hand, my lords, it is equally clear, that if we trust to our regular army alone, if we cannot find means of giving effectual support to our army by some species of accessory force, we, must be overwhelmed: it is physically impossible for us to raise a regular army strong enough, to meet that which may be brought against us.&#x2014;It has been justly observed, that our army is already so numerous, as to form a greater drain on the population of this kingdom, than that of any other country in Europe has to supply. There is no other country, in which so great a number of men, in proportion to the total population, are employed in the military service of the state, In this calculation, the militia, and the seamen in his majesty's navy, must be taken into the account, as much as the troops of the line: for they are equally withdrawn from the pursuits of industry, in which they would otherwise be engaged. Thus, independently of foreigners, the total number of our own people, who have no other business but to defend the British empire and its dependen-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0595"/>
<col>1129</col>
cies, amounts to about 375,000, which is not less than one fortieth of our whole population. In several of the petty German principalities, where the princes were the most oppressively severe in their demands of military service from their subjects, it was found impossible to carry the numbers of their troops to a higher proportion than one sixtieth of the population, and few of the greater powers in Germany have ventured even this length. It has been argued from this fact, that we are already arrived at the utmost limit, to which the numbers of our regular force can be carried, and that no improvement in the system of recruiting, or in the condition of the soldiery, will enable us to make any very great addition to our army. The idea certainly has some plausibility; but whether it be correct or not, this at least is clear, that there must be some limit to the numbers of our regular forces&#x2014;that there is some proportion to the population, beyond which no country can extend its army; and we have no reason to suppose that we can afford a greater proportion of our population, than our enemies can of theirs.&#x2014;It is therefore quite impossible that the British islands, with a population of about 15 millions, can maintain a standing army equal to that, which may be drawn from the countries under the control of the French emperor, peopled with 50 or 60 millions: and the disproportion of numbers is too great to be counterbalanced by any superiority of personal prowess. If, therefore, we were reduced to the necessity of maintaining the contest against France by our regular armies alone, no hope could be entertained that we should ultimately prevail; and our subjugation would be inevitable. Happily, however, for the liberties of mankind, there is a natural and a material difference between the case of a nation which has to defend its own independence, and that of a nation engaged in offensive warfare. An invading power can act only by its regular armies; but the nation that is invaded may bring the great mass of its population to support its army. The bulk of the people, who are engaged in the pursuits of peaceful industry, can give no assistance in attacking a neighbouring country, but may be of great use in the defence of their own. To the employment of this great resource, France herself owed the preservation of her independence, from the dangers with which it was threatened in the early periods of the revolution. It was by the <i>lev&#x00E9;e en masse</i>, that the united Austrian and Prussian armies were repulsed; and it is only, by similar means that we can now hope to
<col>1130</col>
save our country from still more imminen<ob/>t perils.&#x2014;Here, my lords, I shall no doubt be told, that our government does not mean to trust to the standing army alone. The noble secretary of state has spoken of the necessity of a varied force, and has hinted at improvements which he has in view in the system of the volunteers.&#x2014;I could have wished, my lords, that if such ameliorations are in contemplation, they had been brought forward for the immediate consideration of parliament, instead of being put off for months, as if it were a matter in which delay can produce no inconvenience. In my view of our situation, never was there a time when we could less afford delay. Whatever measures are to be adopted for our defence, there is not a month, not a week, to be lost in applying them to practice. A delay of no long period may be fatal.&#x2014;Without waiting, however, till the noble lord may explain what his views are, I feel confident in asserting, that it is impossible to devise any plan, by which the volunteers can be rendered a defensive force adequate to the present crisis. I am far, my lords, from feeling the least disposition to undervalue the merits of a body of men, who have made the noblest and most patriotic sacrifices; but the system of their institution is liable to fundamental objections, which no exertions on their part can ever overcome. I have seen too much of the patriotic zeal of the volunteers not to honour the spirit which animates them, and not to trust that, when the hour of peril comes, they will meet it with all that determination, which an enthusiastic attachment to the cause of their country's freedom can inspire.&#x2014;I am sensible too, that the volunteer establishment, even if it were to be broken up immediately, has already done important services to the country. It has diffused a military spirit, and no inconsiderable portion of military knowledge, throughout the nation. It has infused into the people a confidence in our own resources; and, above all, it has removed every clog to the full employment of these resources, by extinguishing totally, and I trust for ever, those, jealousies which formerly prevailed between the government and the people, in regard to military force. Formerly there was an excessive diffidence on the part of government, to put arms into the hands of any but the standing army; while, on the other hand, a corresponding jealousy subsisted in the people and in parliament, against intrusting the crown with a considerable standing army. While this spirit mutually prevailed, the exertions of the country were cramped. There was no m<ob/>ore
<image src="S1V0009P0I0596"/>
<col>1131</col>
in which our military resources could be called forth, that was not, on one side or the other, an object of jealousy. This spirit is now at an end, and it is the volunteer establishment that has annihilated it. At the commencement of the present war, the government, with a magnanimous confidence in the spirit and loyalty of the people, threw itself upon their spontaneous efforts for support, and put arms into the hands of 4 or 500,000 volunteers. This act of confidence was met by a reciprocal confidence on the part of the people. Indeed it could not be otherwise. How could the people entertain any suspicion of a design against their liberties on the part of a government, which did exactly what a treacherous and designing ruler would be most afraid of doing? How could they fear that the army would be turned against their liberties, by those men who gave them the arms by which every such attack might be repelled? This great measure was not only a mark of confidence on the part of government, but an unequivocal earnest of the rectitude of their intentions; and as such it has been received by the country. We hear no more of scruple about granting to the crown the most numerous armies that can be raised. The only question now is, how their numbers can be most effectually augmented; and were any member of parliament now to repeat the declamations against standing armies, that were formerly so popular, what would he meet with but ridicule? The result then of this magnificent experiment has been, not only to prove the perfect safety with which the people may be trusted with arms, but to establish a degree of mutual confidence between the crown and the people heretofore unknown, and to fix it on an immoveable basis. If the volunteer establishment had done no other service to England than this, I should think the ministers, who had accomplished so noble a work, entitled to the lasting gratitude of their country.&#x2014;But, my lords, while I pay a just tribute of praise, both to the individual merit of the volunteers, and to the utility that has been derived from the institution, I cannot shut my eyes on the intrinsic difficulties, which stand in the way of every attempt to form on this basis an efficient defensive force; and, at a moment like this, when every exertion of which this nation is capable, will not be more than adequate to the crisis in which we are involved, I should think it a very ill judged compliment, to persist in expecting from the volunteers, a species of service for which they are not formed, and to neglect the means that are in our power, of drawing from the mass of the people a
<col>1132</col>
more efficient species of defensive force.&#x2014;It is admitted on all hands, that the discipline as well as the numbers of the volunteers has experienced a material decline. On this I should not be disposed to insist much, if it were merely an accidental circumstance; for I am well convinced, that when the necessity of renewed exertions becomes manifest, the energy of the volunteers may be revived in proportion to the apparent exigency of the crisis.&#x2014;But, my lords, it would be deceiving ourselves, to consider this decline of the volunteers as an accidental circumstance: it has arisen from the very nature of the institution. A system, the efficiency of which rests so entirely on individual exertion, cannot be permanent and steady in its effects. At the period when the volunteer establishment was formed, the loyalty and patriotic spirit of the people had been roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm. The apparent danger of the country called forth unprecedented exertions of spontaneous zeal; but as the exigency became less apparent, these exertions naturally relaxed. Even before there was any evident change in the situation of public affairs, the energy of this spirit had begun to decline. Such vehement efforts of enthusiasm could not be of long continuance: the public mind had been on the stretch, and naturally sunk back into a state of languor. To this is to be added, that military exercises were, to many of the volunteers, so great a contrast to their ordinary occupations, as to be a recreation while the attraction of novelty continued: but when that zest was lost, it has been found in general very difficult to preserve their attention unimpaired. From this cause, men of experience have observed, that the state of discipline in the volunteer corps, has in many cases followed an opposite rule, from that which is found to obtain among regular troops; among regular regiments, the oldest is generally supposed to be the best corps; among volunteers, it is more frequently the newest.&#x2014;This instability must be expected in every institution, the efficiency of which rests on the efforts of voluntary zeal; and even if we could reckon with certainty on the revival of an enthusiastic spirit, upon every occasion of danger, that would not be enough. The danger of the country may often be seriously great, when it is not apparent to vulgar eyes. In the present circumstances of Europe, our danger may be considered as permanent; for, even if peace should be concluded, we must look to the probability that our enemy will renew the attack, if ever he can take us unawares. In these circumstances, our defensive preparations cannot be safely trusted to the desultory efforts of spontaneous zeal:
<image src="S1V0009P0I0597"/>
<col>1133</col>
they ought to be arranged on a permanent system, that shall never relax in its energy, and that wall keep our defensive force in a constant state of efficiency, in peace not-less than in war.&#x2014;For this reason, were there no other, the volunteer system must-be considered as inadequate to the present necessities of the country; and it seems to be admitted, even by the warmest advocates of the volunteers, that there is a necessity of devising some establishment of a more permanent nature to replace them. In considering what that establishment ought to be, it becomes us to profit by the experience which has been already obtained; and that we may steer clear of the errors which have obstructed the utility of the volunteers, it is necessary to examine into the inconveniences, which have actually been observed in that system.&#x2014;In the first place, the privilege of each individual to quit his corps, though essential to the idea of a volunteer force, is a material obstruction to the perfection of its discipline. The slender tenure open which the officers hold their authority, compels them to humour every caprice of the men under their command: and though a corps, composed of men of education, sensible of the importance of the object for which they are associated, may be induced to pay that zealous attention, which will enable them to acquire a considerable proficiency in military evolutions; yet it is scarcely possible that the common run of men, place under so precarious an authority, can acquire that steady habit of ready and implicit obedience, which is the most important and perhaps the most difficult lesson, that a soldier has to learn.&#x2014;Secondly, from the composition of the volunteer corps in general, they are of less efficiency and at the same time of more inconvenience to the business of the country, than corps differently composed might be rendered. Many of the volunteers though not beyond the age proper for military service, are yet so far advanced in life, as neither to have the same facility acquiring new habits, nor to be capable of going through the fatigues and hardships of real service with as little personal suffering as men in the prime of youth. From circumstances too in the original formation of the volunteer establishment, the greatest proportion of the men are above the lower class. To serve in a volunteer corps, requires in most instances a pecuniary sacrifice, sufficient to deter the most numerous class of the people, while, on the other hand, many incidental motives have contributed to induce men in the middle classes of society to enter very generally into this service. In conse-
<col>1134</col>
quence of this, the men who are to be employed in repelling the enemy, are in a very great proportion heads of families, or persons whose superintendance is essential, for the management of various agricultural, manufacturing, and commercial establishments, of more or less extensive scale. These men I have no doubt would fight with spirit, if they were led at once to meet the enemy; but if their absence from home should be protracted for a long period, the interruption of their domestic concerns might be of material inconvenience. From this cause it is a matter of great and almost insuperable difficulty to bring together a large body of volunteers, or to keep them embodied for any great length of time. The operations of the enemy may, however, render it indispensable to require this sacrifice from the persons who compose our defensive force. Previously to their grand attempt, the enemy may harass us by frequent false alarms. The volunteers may thus be fatigued by long-continued preparations, or may be disgusted by the frequent recurrence of a summons to the field, repeatedly terminating to no apparent purpose; and, under the impressions to which this may lead, they may perhaps be remiss in their exertions at the moment of the serious attack. This disadvantage would be in a great measure avoided, if the persons who compose our defensive force were of a different description. A young journeyman, or farm-servant, might certainly be spared from his occupation and his home with infinitely less inconvenience than his master; and he would probably fight as well, and stand the fatigues of service much better. There is another important consideration, which leads to the same conclusion. Since lives must be lost in the defence of the country, either the risk ought to tall equally on all; or, if any difference is to be made, those ought to be exempted from the post of danger, whose lives are of most consequence to the good of society. In the volunteer system, the very opposite to this rule takes place: those who are selected to be exposed to the weapons of the enemy, are chiefly men of the middle classes of society, upon most of whom there are many other individuals dependent for their maintenance and their welfare. By any great slaughter among men of this description, the &#x0153;conomy of society would be deranged, infinitely more than in proportion to the mere numerical amount of lives lost. Such a loss upon a class of men, the peculiar pride and distinguishing feature of our country, would be a national calamity not easily to be repaired; and in this view the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0598"/>
<col>1135</col>
employment of a military force, composed as the volunteers in general are, must be considered as a species of profusion, for which no pecuniary advantage can sufficiently <ob/>compensate. Lastly, it does not seem equitable that those who are, from their age and circumstances, the most suitable persons to defend the country, should be exempted from this duty, merely because they are not so well disposed as others, who are perhaps by nature less qualified. Still more must it be reckoned unfair, that the pecuniary burthen of the defence of the country should be made to bear harder on the loyal and zealous, than on those who are otherwise. In the establishment of the volunteer corps, a preference was shown, from very natural motives, of public &#x0153;conomy, to those corps which agreed to serve on terms apparently the least burthen-some to the public revenue. It cannot however be overlooked, that any advantage which could thus be gained to the revenue, could only arise from the individual volunteers taking upon themselves a greater share of the actual expense of their own establishment. The burthen, to which many of them have thus subjected themselves, is of very serious amount, and is evidently a real and effective tax, not less than if it were collected from them, and paid out again from the exchequer, and this tax is levied exclusively from the liberal and the zealous. It must surely appear more consistent with justice, that the whole expense of the defence of the kingdom should be paid by the public at large, and raised from every man according to his pecuniary means; and also that the personal service required should be fixed by law,&#x2014;that a general rule should point out the description of persons on whom this duty ought to fall, and impose it on them without partiality. For all these reasons, my lords, I think the volunteer system is inferior in equity as well as in efficiency, to the system of training the people at large, first laid down by the act of 1803, commonly called the Levy en Masse Act. That act, though its principles are in my opinion unquestionably just and important, has unfortunately not been carried into execution, and was replaced last year by a new training bill, differing from it in no essential point, and in scarcely any that can be deemed an improvement. Both acts, however, distinctly lay down and proceed upon the great and important principle, that military, service for the internal defence of the kingdom is a general duty on all the subjects of the crown&#x2014;that it is the right of the state to call for that service, in any way that may be deemed most proper and expedient.&#x2014;
<col>1136</col>
The rules for apportioning this service among the people, appear to me to be founded in juster principles in the act of 1803, than in that of last year. A classification is made of the male population of the kingdom, within the ages of military duty, according to the age and domestic circumstances of each individual; and it is the clear intention of the act that the youngest of the men who are come to the age of maturity, and those who are least incumbered with families, ought to be the first called on for military service. The evident propriety of this principle is such as to need no commentary; but in the application of this principle I would incline to deviate in a small degree, from the provisions of the act to which I have alluded. By this act, the first class is to include all unmarried men between the ages of seventeen and thirty. The age of seventeen is perhaps too young:&#x2014;that of eighteen is low enough to be taken as the standard of manhood: and I should think the first class sufficiently extensive, if it included all from that age to twenty-four or five. Within these limits it does not appear necessary to make any distinction of married or unmarried. The number of married men of this age will not be very numerous: and there is no probability that they should have such numerous families, as to call for any relaxation in their favour. Those who have paid a due attention to the valuable speculations of Mr. Malthus, certainly will not think it a politic measure to make any distinction, that might operate as a temptation to premature marriages among the common people; and, since we must consider the measures now to be adopted as of permanent continuance, these remote effects are not to be overlooked. At all events, the number of married persons of this age cannot be so considerable as to occasion much inconvenience, even though it were necessary to adopt some means of providing for their families at the public expense; and this would be preferable to the allowance of an exemption, which might have the effect of deranging the whole system.&#x2014;Calculating upon this principle, from approved tables of the ordinary duration of human life, the population of Great Britain would afford nearly 600,000 men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five; and from the returns made under the Levy en Masse Act, there is ground to believe that, after deducting sea-faring men and all others exempted by that act, there
<image src="S1V0009P0I0599"/>
<col>1137</col>
will remain liable to military duty upwards of 500,000 men within the description of the first class here laid down. This number, my lords, I am inclined to consider as sufficient for the object in view; and on this account it appears to be unnecessary to extend the first class any further. Perhaps, however, it would be advisable to form the men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty into a second class, or body of reserve, to be resorted to in cases of extreme urgency.&#x2014;The most important question, however, relates to the measures to be adopted for giving these men a sufficient degree of training. It is certainly of more importance, to give a complete training to a moderate proportion of the people, than to extend over the whole that slight degree of instruction, which will not render them capable of the service that may be required from them. The men who are to be trained ought, in my opinion, to be rendered complete soldiers; and I think it a very ill-judged &#x0153;conomy not to give them a sufficient allowance of time for becoming so. The provisions both of the Levy en Masse act, and of the Training Bill of last year, are in this respect equally objectionable. The duty required is limited in both of them within such narrow bounds, that it is scarcely possible to expect from it any real practical utility. The men are not to be called out more than twenty-four days in the year, and even these can only be reckoned half days, as the men have to go and return from their homes. The limitation too, provided by the Training Bill, that the men are not to be called to a greater distance than five miles from their homes, will, in most instances, effectually prevent the assemblage of any considerable body of men together, without which, the exercise in petty platoons will be of very little use in preparing men for real service.&#x2014;The anxiety of the framers of these bills, not to interfere with the ordinary avocations of the people, in the attempt to give them military instruction, appears to have been carried to excess, and has led them to adopt regulations calculated totally to defeat the principal object they had in view. A training so very slight and desultory, as that which is provided for, would, in all probability, prove entirely useless; the whole expence would be thrown away; and all the inconvenience arising from the interruption of labour, would be to no purpose. Thus, by an over-anxiety to economize the time of the people, an absolute waste is occa-
<col>1138</col>
sioned. In fact, something like this is ever the result of an attempt to reconcile objects that are incompatible. To train men to military discipline without interfering with their civil avocations, is an absolute impossibility. If men are to act as soldiers, a portion of their time must be devoted to the object of learning the duty of soldiers;&#x2014;for a certain length of time they must be separated from their families, and cease to be any thing but soldiers. The truth of this principle is fully evinced by the experience of the volunteers. The testimony of every volunteer officer, who has paid attention to the improvement of his corps, is uniform upon this point, that the greatest number of days, devoted to drilling in an unconnected and desultory manner, has never enabled them to make the same progress, that has been obtained in a very small space of time, when the men were assembled in quarters at a distance from their homes, and kept on permanent duty under military law.&#x2014;In making arrangements, therefore, for training the people to arms, we must reckon upon a considerable sacrifice of their time as absolutely unavoidable. No unnecessary sacrifice ought to be required; but, on the other hand, we ought not to hesitate to make the sacrifice to the full extent that is necessary for the complete attainment of the object. We have then to enquire, what length of time devoted to military discipline may be considered as sufficient, to form new recruits into good soldiers. This is a question on which professional men only can pretend to judge; but on the authority of officers of eminence I am led to believe, that three or four months, when well employed, may in general be found sufficient. An advantage will certainly be found, in this respect, from the description of men who are proposed to be trained. Young men below twenty-five are at a period of life when new habits are easily adopted, and when impressions readily become permanent. Men of this age will probably become good soldiers in a much shorter time, than men of a more advanced age, and will also retain more permanently what they learn. When they have once thoroughly attained the habits of military discipline, a very little practice will be sufficient to keep up these habits even to a late period of life.&#x2014;Upon these principles, my lords, I would propose to arrange the details of the measure. There should be formed in each county a corps, to consist of all the young men from the age of eigh-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0600"/>
<col>1139</col>
teen to twenty-five. They should be fully officered, and regularly organized as a local militia, but should remain peculiarly under the superintendance of the lieutenantcy, not to be called out of their respective counties, except in cases of emergency. The young men, who have recently entered into this militia, and are in the first year of their service, should be considered as forming a separate class, to be kept embodied for at least three months, and during this time assiduously employed in military exercises. Those who have gone through their first year, and have attained the requisite degree of proficiency, would not require more than a few weeks practice in the course of each of the succeeding years of their service, to keep up the habits of discipline, and ought not to be called out on duty for any longer period than is necessary for this purpose. The most advantageous arrangement would be, that for a few weeks in every summer the whole of this local militia should be assembled in suitable encampments. Being thus collected in considerable numbers, they could the better practise those exercises, which have the nearest resemblance to the operations of real service against the enemy. All officers are agreed as to the importance of collecting men in large bodies for exercises of this kind; and to obtain this benefit in a higher degree, it would be proper that during this general assemblage of the local militia, those of two or three adjacent counties should join in the same encampment, and carry on their exercises in one body.&#x2014;Immediately after the breaking up of this general assemblage, the annual enrolment should be made of the young men who, in the course of the preceding year, have attained the age of service. Instead of collecting all of them at once, it would be preferable, that they should be classed into different divisions, to join their corps in rotation. By this means the labour of training them would be less burthensome, and smaller number of officers would be sufficient for the task. By this means, also, a certain proportion of the local militia of each county would always be embodied. <ob/>Corresponding to this proportion, there should be, in each county, a permanent establishment of officers, drawn from the regular army, and acquainted with real service, whose duty it would be, not only to direct the training of the men, but to instruct the younger officers. The superior officers of the local militias ought to be selected, like
<col>1140</col>
the officers of our present militia, from among the principal landed proprietors of the county. Of the subaltern ranks, a considerable proportion would naturally be composed of the young men of superior station, who are enrolled in the local militia, as falling within the ages of service. Young men destined for a military life could not perhaps have a better school, than to be thus employed for a few years, under the superintendance of men of experience, in training a continual succession of recruits to military exercises.&#x2014;According to the arrangement which has been proposed, there can be little doubt that these corps of local militia would be rendered completely effective, and little inferior even to regular troops which have not actually seen service. This would be done, too, with as little interruption to the ordinary avocations of the people, as could perhaps be reconciled with the effectual accomplishment of the essential object. In the beginning, indeed, a great and extraordinary effort would be necessary: but after the proposed measures had been brought into a regular train, the burthen of duty would be very light on all except the young men of eighteen or nineteen, who are in the first year of their training. There is no other description of men whose absence from their homes and their ordinary occupations would so little interfere with the business of the country. The men of this description may be calculated at between 90 and 100,000 over the whole of Great Britain; and if they join their respective corps according to a plan of rotation, each for three months, there would only be one fourth of these constantly embodied, <i>i</i>. <i>e</i>. never above 25,000 men at one time; and the interruption to the ordinary business of the country would not be greater, than would be occasioned by an addition of this amount to the regular army. To this are to be added the few weeks during which the whole of the local militia would be assembled. If this should be reckoned at three weeks, the individuals subject to this service, would not be called upon for a greater sacrifice of their time than many of the volunteers submit to,&#x2014;all of them, indeed, who are in any degree fit for real duty; so that this plan cannot be considered as a greater burthen on the country, than an establishment of an equal number of volunteers. It would indeed be less burthensome; for the volunteer corps are in great part composed of men, the real value of whose time is far greater
<image src="S1V0009P0I0601"/>
<col>1141</col>
than that of the young men, of whom it is proposed to form this local militia<sup>*</sup>.&#x2014;An exception must no doubt be admitted, for the first moments of this establishment, when a great and extraordinary effort will be necessary, for bringing our state of preparation up to what it would have been, if this system had been sooner adopted. If it had already gone on for some years, all the young men from the age of nineteen to that of twenty-five would now be in a state of full preparation, having entered the local militia at eighteen, and having undergone a thorough training during the first year of their service. As matters actually stand, however, there is a great arrear to be cleared off; and to make up for the tardiness which we have shown in resorting to the system, we have no choice but to take immediate measures for training all the young men below the age of twenty-five&#x2014;a great and a burthensome effort, no doubt, but one which the exigency of the crisis imperiously demands.&#x2014;When the system which has been proposed, is compared with that of the volunteers, no doubt can be entertained that its efficiency must be incomparably greater. The men within the ages that have been stated, cannot be reckoned at less than 500,000; and to this extent we should at all times have a force ready at an hour's warning to march against the enemy; a force regularly and systematically disciplined, and on which a commander might fully rely; a force composed of men in the full vigour of life, and animated with all the ardour which characterizes the prime of youthful manhood. With such a force to back our regular army, we might bid defiance to all our enemies. A local militia, constituted in the efficient manner that has been proposed, would certainly be alone sufficient for the defence of all those parts of the coast that are not peculiarly exposed, and where the principal descent of the enemy is not to be expected, The whole of the troops of the line, and of the regular or old established militia, might then be concentrated in one powerful army, in a position calculated to meet the main invasion. If the enemy should succeed in landing an army of such force, as to be an overmatch for that which is thus prepared to receive him in the first
<quote><sup>*</sup>According to the plan which has been here sketched, the expense incurred to the public would not be very widely different from that of the volunteers, when their establishment was at its height.</quote>
<col>1142</col>
instance, the skill of our commanders would be tried, in avoiding a general action as long as possible. Our army retiring from one strong position to another, towards the interior of the country, would be continually approaching to their re-inforcements, and the local militia pouring in from all sides, would soon form such an addition of force, as to be capable of overwhelming the most powerful army, that the invader would choose to risk in the undertaking. In the course of these operations, indeed, some part of our country would unavoidably be left exposed to the ravages of the enemy, but it is not likely that we should be under the necessity of abandoning the metropolis; for the metropolis itself would furnish so large a re-inforcement, as might, in all probability, decide the fate of the campaign.&#x2014;The measures that have been suggested, would thus be of great importance in enabling us to meet the immediate exigency, which now presses upon us. But this is only a part of the benefit to be expected from them. Were they established as a permanent system, our means of defence would go on, in a continual progress of improvement. Every year a new crop, it I may use the expression, of nearly 100,000 youths would enter the local militia to begin the acquisition of military discipline; every year a corresponding proportion would quit this militia, but would carry with them habits firmly fixed in that period of life when lasting impressions are most easily made. Every year, therefore, a greater and a greater proportion of our people would be ready to take up arms in defence of their country; and if the dangers of our situation should continue to increase, so that even a force of 500,000 well-disciplined men in aid of our regular army should appear insufficient for our security, the second class of local militia would soon be composed of men who had been thoroughly trained in the first class, and who would still be perfectly capable of doing the duty of soldiers. In process of time, the whole people will have gone through a course of discipline; we shall become, like our enemies, a nation of soldiers; and then England will assuredly be, invincible.&#x2014;There is no reason for apprehending that this institution will ever relax in its efficacy. Established on a systematic plan, the training of the local militia must go on in peace as well as in war. If there be any probability that peace can be
<image src="S1V0009P0I0602"/>
<col>1143</col>
obtained, on terms which this country can accept without disgrace, we must assuredly look upon it as a hollow and insecure peace, as a mere truce which the enemy will be ready to break, whenever he can see an opportunity of taking us unawares. But, with the institution that has been sketched, we never can be unprepared to meet an invader. Whether therefore we look to the continuance of war, or whether we may hope for peace, it is of equal importance that we should establish our defence on a system of this kind; a system of permanent efficacy, commensurate with the prospects that are before us, of a long period of unabated danger.&#x2014;It is not perhaps the least of the recommendations of this proposal, that it will render it possible for us to make peace with a prospect of security. If a peace should be made, we have no reason to suppose that our enemy will abandon his views of conquest, or relinquish his naval preparations. His means of making a successful invasion will be continually on the increase; and an interval of peace will only enable him to augment his naval force with the greater rapidity. On this account many persons, who on general principles are sincere friends of peace, are now advocates for the continuance of war, as being, under our present circumstances, absolutely necessary for our immediate safety. If however we adopt the system which has been proposed, our means of meeting invasion will also be on the increase; and whatever addition our enemy may be able to make, during an interval of peace, to his naval power and his means of attack, we shall be able fully to keep pace with him in the improvement of our means of defence by land. Being thus under no danger of losing in our relative strength during an interval of peace, or of being obliged to renew the war under circumstances of greater disadvantage, in the comparative state of our own force and that of our enemies, the obstacles which now stand in the way of peace, will be in a great measure removed. We may then conclude a peace, with the prospect of undiminished security, and therefore with a prospect of permanence. Perhaps, indeed, if such a system as that now proposed, had been established ten years ago, Europe might have been spared the whole of the present war, and all its disastrous consequences. Our rupture with France might have been avoided, if our internal situation had been such, as
<col>1144</col>
both to deter the enemy from hostile designs, and to enable our own government to entertain a confidence in our means of defence. Soon after the rupture it was emphatically observed, that we were at war because we <i>could not</i> be at peace. But if our means of defence in the year 1803 had been such as the system now proposed might soon establish, we should not have been under the necessity <ob/>of resorting to measures of hostility, with a view to our immediate security; neither would the enemy have been disposed to give the provocations which he did, to a power in a contest with which, he could have entertained but little hope of any great or signal success.&#x2014;When I compare the system which I have now ventured to propose, either in its immediate or its more remote effects, with the measure which has been brought forward by his majesty's ministers, I can scarcely imagine non there can be a doubt in deciding between them, or how your lordships can be satisfied, in such a crisis as the present, with a mere temporary expedient for making a small addition to our regular force: nor is it easy to comprehend on what principle his majesty's ministers can hesitate to adept <ob/>this or some other plan of equal efficacy, if it be not that they dread the unpopularity of calling upon the people for severe and burthensome sacrifices. If this idea has really been entertained, I am persuaded it is a mistaken one. The people of this country are not so dead to every feeling of patriotism, they are not so insensible to the value of what they have to lose, as to be unwilling to make the sacrifices that are necessary for preserving the name and the privileges of Englishmen, provided they are made distinctly to perceive the necessity, and are fully persuaded that the sacrifices they are to wake will secure their object. On this ground I am persuaded they will acquiesce with more cheerfulness, in such measures as those I have now suggested, than in those which his majesty's ministers call for.&#x2014;The ballot for which we are desired to vote, lays upon the people an oppressive, because an unequal, burthen, without affording any reasonable probability that our liberties are thereby to be preserved. The ballot, under the name of a demand for military service, we all know to be in effect nothing more than a mode of compelling individuals to pay for substitutes: these substitutes differ in nothing from the recruits who enter the army by voluntary enlistment, except that
<image src="S1V0009P0I0603"/>
<col>1145</col>
in the one case the bounty is paid out of the general revenues of the state, in the other the payment is imposed on individuals, without any regard to their ability to pay: the ballot is thus nothing more than a tax, the most objectionable in principle that can be imagined&#x2014;a mere poll-tax, the most unequal and oppressive form in which money can be levied. When this burthen is laid upon the people to make a trifling addition to our regular force, such an addition as will scarcely diminish in a perceptible degree the perils of our situation, can it be supposed that the people will submit to it with the same alacrity, as they would to an effective demand of real military service, imposed according to an equal and impartial rule, on those to whom it will be least burthensome, and the operation of which must be to put an end to all anxiety respecting the security of the kingdom?&#x2014;But in truth, my lords, I cannot bring myself to believe that in such a crisis as the present, his majesty's ministers can be actuated by such a despicable motive as the fear of unpopularity&#x2014;that their anxiety for the preservation of their places can go so far, as to make them overlook the danger to which they expose themselves, as well as their king and their country. The situation of things is now such, that there is no possibility of saving the nation, without resorting, in one form or another, to burthensome and severe measures. It would be mere state quackery to delude the people with any different expectation. The time is past when a minister might have indulged a tenderness for the comforts and the convenience of the people. We have now to make our measures effectual,&#x2014;to that consideration must every other bend; and of those who complain of hardship there is but one question to be asked, whether the hardships imposed on them are worse than the rigours of French despotism?&#x2014;Perhaps, however, it may be alleged, that I am now proposing a superfluous and unnecessary degree of preparation. But this, my lords, I cannot admit. When we consider the immense military resources that may be brought to bear against us, when we consider the number of points from which we may be assailed, and the extent of coast which we must be prepared to guard; above all, when we consider the hazard in which the whole empire is involved, from the prevalence of disaffection in Ireland, the force that would be gained by the adoption of the measures I have now
<col>1146</col>
suggested, cannot be deemed extravagantly great for meeting the exigencies to which we may ere long be reduced. But were it otherwise, it is right that our preparations should be superabundant: if the least shadow of doubt can remain as to their sufficiency, they are not what they ought to be. Even on principles or &#x0153;conomy, our defensive force ought to be ample and superabundant. Granting that a more scanty plan of preparation should ultimately prove sufficient, and that the invader should in the end be repulsed; yet if this is to be done after a severe contest on English ground, our country would suffer from the desolation of a protracted warfare, far greater losses than would be sufficient to balance the utmost inconvenience, that could possibly be apprehended from preparations unnecessarily great. By providing ample means of defence, we have the best chance of deterring our enemy from the attempt at invasion, and thus saving our country from the ravages of war, or at least of shortening their duration by insuring the speedy overthrow of the invader. But can any one reflect for a moment upon the countless horrors that would ensue if our means of defence should prove inadequate, can any one reflect that it is for the liberties, for the very existence of England that we are to fight,&#x2014;and be content with scanty preparations? Who is there that can imagine without horror, our aged and beloved monarch weltering in his blood,&#x2014;his place occupied by a heptarchy of French usurpers, the minions of the conqueror,&#x2014;the family of our sovereigns, along with the sad remains of, all that is now eminent and dignified in England, wandering as exiles in foreign lands, while the mansions of our nobility are parcelled out to French generals, and every thing that is desirable in England becomes the prey of a Frenchman,&#x2014;all the comforts which industry and &#x0153;conomy have accumulated around the dwellings of our yeomanry, our tradesmen, and our manufacturers, scattered to the winds, the pillage of a licentious soldiery,&#x2014;all the civil and religious institutions, that have hitherto been the boast of Britain, trampled under foot,&#x2014;our people left to groan under the oppression and contumely of insolent and domineering strangers, forced to submit to every wrong and to every insult, with the sad reflection, that they have no longer the protection of English law, of an English magistracy, or an English jury<sup>*</sup>? All this, my lords,
<quote>This is but a faint and feeble sketch of the</quote>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0604"/>
<col>1147</col>
and yet more than this, we have to guard against; and shall we then consider the inconvenience, of making preparations rather greater than absolutely necessary, as deserving of a moment's thought?&#x2014;By the adoption of the measures which I have detailed, our situation may be rendered perfectly secure; and if our activity and resolution be commensurate with the exigency of the crisis, a very few months may be sufficient to bring our preparations to maturity. With such a local militia, as I have suggested, to back the efforts of our regular force, I should consider our army as already sufficiently numerous; or at least there would be no necessity, of resorting to a measure so objectionable as the ballot, for obtaining an immediate augmentation of our disposable force.&#x2014;I am ready to admit to the noble secretary of state the advantages, which a regular and disposable force must have over an equal number of troops of any other description, even for the purposes of defence. But these advantages may be purchased too dear: and certainly, if ever there was a conjuncture of affairs, in which these advantages were of less value than usual, it is the present. If ever there was a time when the immediate defence of the kingdom ought to engross our thoughts, to the exclusion of every distant object, it is now. But, from the observations of a noble lord, who spoke in support of this bill, it would appear that ministers are thinking of Alexandria, and the Cape, and South America, when they should be looking to Kent and to Essex. Gracious heavens! is it possible that infatuation can be carried to this length?&#x2014;that when the existence of England is in question, her strength is to be wasted in distant expeditions and colonial conquests? Gladly would I hope that the noble lord has misconceived the ideas of his friends; but the extreme anxiety which is manifested for a disposable force, and the whole tenour of the measure before us, form such a commentary on the observation that dropped from the noble lord, as fills me with dread and anxiety. As if our internal defence were not already sufficiently precarious, his majesty's ministers propose to make a trifling augmentation to our disposable force, at the expense of disorgani-
<quote>consequences of French conquest: but the picture has been drawn in detail, and with a was masterly hand, by the author of The Dangers of the Country;&#x2014;a picture which Englishmen would do well to look at, while yet the danger <i>may</i> be averted.</quote>
<col>1148</col>
zing the militia, suspending its efficiency at most critical moment, and disgusting its officers; and to gain a momentary addition to the total amount of our force, they propose an expedient which will give a serious interruption to the measures, that have lately been adopted, for the permanent improvement of the regular army.&#x2014;Looking, my lords, to the dangers of our situation as likely to be permanent, I cannot agree to sacrifice to a mere momentary convenience the lasting and important advantages arising from the measures I have alluded to&#x2014;measures, founded on a just and profound view of human nature, the benefits of which every year's experience will render more apparent, and which will do lasting honour both to the administration which carried them into effect, and to the enlightened individual with whom they more particularly originated. The observation of the noble secretary of state, that the interference will only be temporary, is not in my mind a satisfactory answer to the objection; for the benefit to be expected from these measures depends in so great a degree, on a general belief in the permanence of the new system, that any thing which has even the appearance of tampering, must have a destructive effect in shaking the confidence of the country. I am the more inclined to insist on this objection, because the interference which I deprecate, is wholly unnecessary. I have stated, my lords, that by the establishment of an extensive and well-trained local militia, we should preclude the necessity of any great and immediate addition to our regular force. But it is not on this alone, that I rest my objection; for if such an addition be necessary, and it a compulsatory levy for the immediate augmentation of our regular and militia forces be unavoidable, that levy may be enforced, without affecting in any degree the success of the new system of enlistment.&#x2014;The mode in winch the ballot interferes with the recruiting of the regular army, has been repeatedly and amply illustrated. It is now admitted on all hands, that the demand for substitutes establishes a competition against the recruiting service; and that when an extensive ballot is to be enforced, the price of substitutes will be so high, that no recruits can be expected to accept of the low bounty now offered for the regular army. This is the unavoidable effect of a ballot accompanied, as ours now is, with the power of substitution; but it is evident, that this effect, arises from substitution and
<image src="S1V0009P0I0605"/>
<col>1149</col>
not fromballot,&#x2014;that no such effect would arise from a ballot, if the individuals balloted were to serve in person.&#x2014;I know my lords, that the power of serving by substitute is considered as necessary, for mitigating the severity of the ballot, and for obviating the excessive hardship which might be occasioned in particular cases, it the individual whose name is drawn were under the absolute necessity of quitting his home and his business. But this hardship may be obviated by other means less objectionable than the power of serving by substitute. I would propose, my lords, as a commutation for this power, that those who are anxious to avoid the necessity of serving in person, should be allowed, upon payment of an adequate pecuniary fine, before the ballot takes place, to take their name out of the list of those subject to be drawn. When every individual has thus an opportunity of withdrawing himself beforehand from the operation of the ballot, there would be no necessity of leaving any power of serving by substitute, and those whose names are actually drawn, should be bound to serve in person. It is evident, that by this arrangement, we should avoid the pernicious effect of the ballot, in drawing off, as substitutes, persons who would otherwise be disposed to enlist into the troops of the line. At the same time, it does not appear that such an arrangement would occasion to individuals any greater oppression than the present form of ballot, since the payment of a fine before the ballot would not be a more severe tax, than the burthen of paying a substitute after it.&#x2014;I do not mean, my lords, to argue, that this arrangement would be sufficient to do away every objection to the ballot. That is certainly an institution which I think it would be very desireable to avoid altogether; and I would anxiously wish that the supply of men, for our regular force of all descriptions, could be trusted entirely to the operation of voluntary enlistment. If, however, that is impracticable; if a compulsory levy must be made, and if ballot must be resorted to, I cannot but consider this as a less objectionable form of ballot than that now established. Perhaps, by some further ameliorations, the oppressive severity of that institution might be still more alleviated. The age of the men subject to the operation of the ballot should be reduced, and ought not, I think, to extend beyond twenty-five years: the period of service imposed should also be limited
<col>1150</col>
to three years, as in the original institution of the militia. The unavoidable hardship of the ballot, its interference with the personal liberty of individuals, ought to be compensated by great liberality in pecuniary bounty. In particular, all the fines paid for exemption from the ballot, ought to be applied, by the magistracy of the district in which they are levied, to the use of the balloted men, or of their families.&#x2014;The ballot, thus mitigated, would be liable to infinitely less objection than it now is; and might perhaps be used for obtaining a much larger addition to our regular domestic force, than that now proposed by his majesty's ministers. There are some parts of the empire, to which a local militia, such as I have proposed, could not perhaps be safely extended. The inhabitants of these parts would thus be exempted from the burthen of a military duty, imposed on the rest of their fellow subjects; and as a commutation for this duty, it may not be improper, that the corresponding class of men there should be subject to a ballot in the mitigated form, which I have now pointed out. The population of the districts, to which I allude, might afford a large supply of men, without any material interruption to agricultural or manufacturing industry: and all the supply that can be obtained would be doubly useful, both as directly adding to the military force of the empire, and as draining off a leaven which may eventually become dangerous.&#x2014;But, my lords, whatever compulsory levy may be resolved upon, I must concur in the opinion, which has already been urged with irresistible force of argument, that the balloted men ought to be placed in the second battalions of our marching <ob/>regiments, on the principle Of the Army of Reserve act, rather than in the militia. To ballot for an addition to the militia, in order to have an opportunity of drawing off a corresponding number of men from the militia into the line, seems to me to involve a very inconvenient complication, without any adequate motive whatever. The pernicious effects which may be expected, from disturbing the discipline and efficiency of the militia regiments at such a moment as this, have been clearly pointed out by a noble viscount (Sidmouth), as well as the effect which this measure must have, in undermining the present militia establishment altogether, by disgusting the officers. Their patience has already been sufficiently tried, in the frequent repetition of the same
<image src="S1V0009P0I0606"/>
<col>1151</col>
expedient, tending to impress them with the idea that their corps are to be degraded into mere subsidiary battalions, to be employed in drilling recruits for the line. But if ever this expedient was objectionable, it is doubly so at this moment, when the defence of the kingdom should be our chief concern, and when the militia is more likely than ever to be called into that active service for resisting invasion, for which their institution was peculiarly framed.&#x2014;These topics, my lords, have already been so ably discussed, that it would be presumptuous in me to suppose, that I could add any thing to the force of the arguments that have been urged. I shall conclude, therefore, with declaring that I cannot give my assent to the bill now before us, when its particular provisions appear to me so objectionable, when the advantages to be expected from it are so inconsiderable, and when its immediate objects would be rendered wholly superfluous, by the adoption of measures commensurate with the exigency of our situation.&#x2014;The question being then put, that the bill be read a second time, a division took place: Contents 42; Non-Contents, 15; Majority, 27.</membercontribution></p>

<housecommons>
<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-08-10">Monday, August 10.</date>
<p><member>[WEST-INDIA COLONIES.] Mr. Ellis</member>,<membercontribution> pursuant to notice, rose to call the attention of the house to this most important subject. He did not mean to detain the house by going at any length into the question, because it must be obvious to any gentleman who should examine the report of the committee on the commercial state of the West-India Colonies, that some relief was necessary to maintain the interests of those colonies. It would be impossible to carry into effect, during the present session, any remedies to which that house was to be a party, but he must recommend it to the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, to direct his attention to this most interesting subject during the recess, in order that he might be prepared with some means of alleviating the distress of the West-India planters in the ensuing session. He wished to direct the attention of that right hon. gent. to the subject more anxiously, because he had reason to apprehend that it was the opinion of that right hon. gent., that a reduction of the duty upon sugars would not be any relief to the planter. The hon. member then went into a consideration of the Report, to
<col>1152</col>
shew that all the duty laid on sugars, after a certain amount, fell on the planter, and not on the consumer; and contended that even if the reduction of the duty should not immediately relieve the planter, it would have the effect of increasing the consumption, by which means the market, at present overstocked, might be cleared, and the increase of the consumption would augment the revenue. The employment of sugar in distilleries would also have contributed to the relief of the planters, by adding to the consumption of the article, but the objection that existed against it rendered that impossible. Whilst the market was unrestrained, the price of sugar had kept pace with the rise of the duty, but the contrary had been the case ever since the year 1800. If the ports of Europe were to be shut against them, the planters would have but the home-market to look to, and what would be their prospect with an import of 100,000<i>l</i>. above the consumption, unless that consumption should be encouraged? Another remedy suggested in the Report he should not then dwell upon, because he did not wish to force his majesty's ministers to any premature declaration upon the subject, nor was he disposed to give rise to any discussion which might assume that intemperate tone that characterized the proceedings in another country. He hoped, if a reduction in the duty upon brandy was in contemplation, that it would be accompanied with a reduction of the duty upon rum. On all these grounds he moved a resolution, "that the house should, early in the next session of parliament, take into consideration the report of the committee on the Commercial State of the West-India colonies."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Rose</member> <membercontribution>jun. seconded the motion. He expressed his conviction of the urgent necessity of the case, and was sorry, that the state of the session would not allow the house to go into it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>had no objection to the motion of the hon. gent., and certainly the handsome and candid manner in which he had brought it forward claimed the attention of the house. For himself, he could answer, that the subject should have his most serious attention. He did not think it necessary to go further into the question then, though he should say, that it was impossible to read the Report without feeling how interesting the subject was from the circumstance of so large a mass of property being involved in
<image src="S1V0009P0I0607"/>
<col>1153</col>
difficulty, not to use any stronger terms. He could therefore assure the hon. gent., that his majesty's ministers would not lose any time that could be profitably applied to this subject, and that next session some measure would be brought forward to obviate the difficulties at present existing.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lushington</member> <membercontribution>was glad to find that the attention of the house was at last directed to West-India interests. The circumstances in which the colonies were placed by the abolition of the slave trade, contrary to the opinion of the planters, gave them a claim upon the legislature. The Report said, that unless some immediate remedy were to be applied, ruin would be the consequence to the West Indies; but it would be five or six months before any legislative remedy could be applied, and this was one of the circumstances that contradicted that passage, which ministers had introduced into his majesty's speech at the close of the last session, that the dissolution took place at a time when no material inconvenience to the public business would arise from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hibbert</member> <membercontribution>was happy to observe the very candid manner in which this subject had been brought forward, and which was much more calculated to produce an impression on the house, than the use of stronger language. The hon. gent. then warmly urged the claims of the West-India proprietors on the legislature, agreeing with the hon. member who preceded him that the dissolution of parliament had been the cause of inconvenience in this respect; and contending, that the justification of that measure was unsatisfactory to the West-India interests, as well as to many persons in that house, who had no ambition to obtain any place in the administration.&#x2014;The resolution was then put and agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[COMMITTEE OR FINANCE.] Mr. Bankes</member> <membercontribution>brought up the second report of the committee of finance respecting the Bank. The report was ordered to lie on the table; but on the motion that it be printed, the hon. gent. thought it necessary to say a few words. It was not in consequence of any inattention on the part of the committee, that this report had not been presented sooner, but, from the various details into which it was necessary to enter, it had been found impossible to present it sooner to the house. Yet if the report had been laid before the house as early as he at first had reason to expect, it was not his inten-
<col>1154</col>
tion, nor, he believed, that of any member of the committee, to ground any motion upon it in the present session, because it would require much time for gentlemen to make themselves acquainted with the whole of the circumstances. As an individual member of parliament, and not as a member of the committee, he might feel himself called upon to submit some resolutions to the house on the subject, though such a proceeding might, and probably would, be rendered unnecessary by the regulations which might be adopted by the governors of the company.&#x2014;The report was then ordered to be printed.&#x2014;The hon. gent. next presented the third report from the finance committee, respecting sinecure offices, places, and pensions, held under the crown. After the report was brought up and read, the hon. gent. observed, that this report had been prepared by the committee pursuant to an instruction from the house of the seventh of last month. Immediately on receiving the instruction, the committee had issued its precepts, and the return to these precepts formed the matter of the report which was just read. It would be for the house to judge whether any vote should be founded on the report, and he did not know whether he should move that in its present state it should be printed, because returns had been received only for a small part of Scotland, and but one or two from Ireland. He hoped, however, that the whole would be completed by next session, when he should be able to take such a course as might seem most eligible.&#x2014;The Report was then ordered to be printed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[PETITION OF DR. HIGHMORE.] Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>observed, that he had a Petition in his hand containing matters of a very grave and serious nature. The statements in the petition were such, that though no man was more disposed than he was to lay any complaint before the house, he would have hesitated to present it were it not that it contained matter of great moment to the public in general. The petitioner Nathaniel Highmore had studied the civil law for 11 years at Jesus college, Cambridge; had performed his exercises with applause, and taken out his degree of doctor. The grievance was, that he was not permitted to practise in Doctors Commons, in consequence of the refusal of the archbishop of Canterbury, to give him the proper authority. He had applied for redress to the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0608"/>
<col>1155</col>
courts of law, but could not be heard; he had, therefore, no appeal, though rejected without any reason assigned. This was an affair of so serious a nature, that if the allegations of the petition should be proved, it ought, perhaps, to be made the subject of legislative regulation hereafter. But he meant to give no opinion on it at present. He imputed no blame to the metropolitan or his officer. They had not acted without precedent, for it was not the practice for 7 years past to give a reason in cases of rejection. He was happy to see those opposite to him (the advocate-general, &amp;c.) who might, perhaps, explain this business. The practitioners of the common law were admitted by the benchers; but they never rejected without reason, and there lay an appeal to the 12 judges. But the present petitioner had in vain attempted to be heard before any court, and that was the reason that he had now come to parliament for redress. The reason privately assigned for this, for none was publicly assigned, was, that the petitioner was in deacon's orders. Even if owing to this he was to be considered as a spiritual person, it was not a reason why he should not practise in a court of civil and ecclesiastical law, and more especially as the practice was, till the 37th of Henry the 8th, entirely confined to spiritual persons; and the chancellorships of the dioceses were still in the hands of spiritual persons. The public had a strong interest in tins case, for it appeared to be decided by a side wind, that persons in deacon's orders were unqualified for practising in the ecclesiastical court, and that without any legislative provision on the subject. The hon. gent. then adverted to a book written by one of the Civilians, so late as 1804, which contained a passage, stating that, in 1764, a person, in deacon's orders, had applied to archbishop Secker, and was rejected, because it was more agreeable to the doctor's practising; and the reason was, that they apprehended the society would become too numerous if this was permitted. Doctors, therefore, appeared to differ on this point; but this writer seemed to think, that being in deacon's orders was no objection; but that the rejection was because it was more agreeable to the actual practitioners, who were apprehensive that the society would become inconveniently numerous. Now, that a gentleman, who had studied at Cambridge, and therefore might be considered as in this instance standing up for the privileges of
<col>1156</col>
the university, should be neglected merely because it might be more agreeable to the society that he should be so, was a point that required some attention from the legislature. They apprehended that the society would become inconveniently numerous. As to that point, there certainly appeared no reason to think that those who were to study 11 years at Cambridge before they were admitted, would incommode the society, supposing that this were an argument worthy of any attention. The power to reject without appeal was too great to be entrusted to any man. This gentleman had gone through all the forms, and if the power of rejection without appeal was to be allowed, the principle would go this length, that not only those who desired to be admitted, but those who were already admitted, would be dependent entirely on the archbishop. But it was said that the archbishop had granted his fiat, without knowing that the petitioner was in deacon's orders, and withdrew it upon receiving information that this was the case. This, however, was not alledged publicly. All that was alledged was, that the thing was not agreeable to the practising doctors. He had some other things to state, but as he had taken up the time of the house so long, he would finish for the present, trusting that the house would take up the matter with that seriousness which its importance seemed to deserve.&#x2014;The hon gent. then presented the petition, which was read at the table. It stated, "that the petitioner, Nathaniel Highmore, doctor and professor of civil law, and member of Jesus college, Cambridge, was, during 11 years, a student of civil law in the university of Cambridge, in consequence of which he obtained the degree of doctor and professor of civil law; and that this degree has ever been held, as by the statute and canon law ordained, a qualification for, and as giving a right to exercise the profession of, an ecclesiastical advocate in the courts of civil and canon law, holden in Doctors Commons, and which courts are placed under the administration of the archbishop of Canterbury; and that the rights, privileges, and immunities of the university of Cambridge are guaranteed and secured by divers royal patents and charters, confirming the same to its different members, and to their several academic degrees; by one of which charters, it is especially provided, that doctors in civil law shall experience neither hindrance nor obstruction in their admission into all ec-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0609"/>
<col>1157</col>
clesiastical offices, whether with or without the cure of souls, the latter of those, as the petitioner conceives, including the office of an ecclesiastical advocate; and this, together with the other charters of that university, was confirmed by an act of the 13th <ob/> Elizabeth; and the petitioner further states, that having received from the register of the said university a certificate of such his full and complete qualification, he did, consequence thereof, duly and regularly obtain the fiat of the archbishop of Canterbury, in pursuance of which his grace's rescript, or commission, appointing him to this ecclesiastical office, was made out, and sealed with the seal of the vicar-general of the province of Canterbury; and that having, notwithstanding such his qualification and his commission, been refused admission, to exercise thereunder his spiritual and canonical profession, and having in vain appealed to the archbishop of Canterbury, as also to the visitors of the college of doctors of law, applying to his grace, and to the said visitors, for an hearing of his case, and for redress of the injury by him sustained, he did carry his suit into the court of king's bench, and did apply for a rule to shew cause why a mandamus should not issue for his admission: which application was however refused by the said court, for the reason that the petitioner had not been able to shew his right to be admitted to this ecclesiastical office, on any grounds of which that court could take cognizance; and unable as the petitioner thus was to obtain, in a court of civil jurisdiction, a discussion of his title and of his qualification for this spiritual office, he applied to the archbishop of Canterbury for permission, in a court of spiritual jurisprudence, to plead his case, but with which application for such public hearing it was deemed unadvisable to comply; and that having been thus excluded from the exercise of his canonical and clerical profession, on the ground of his having formerly taken the orders of a deacon, he has, by the refusal of an hearing to his case, been deprived of the opportunity of shewing, in the first place, that he was duly authorized to divest himself, and did divest himself, of those orders and of his clerical character; and secondly, that although he were even still a clergyman, he would not thereby be disqualified; and therefore praying the house, to take his case into consideration, and grant him relief."&#x2014;On the question, that the petition
<col>1158</col>
do lie upon the table,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Advocate-General</member> <membercontribution>observed, that as the hon. gent. did not mean to institute any proceeding immediately upon the petition, it would not be necessary for him to go at length into the consideration of it. He had only to state, that the petition was founded upon a great misapprehension of facts, and a great misapprehension of legal principles, as applicable to those facts. He did not mean, however, to charge the misapprehension on the hon. gent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. W. Smith</member> <membercontribution>stated, that the allegations in the petition, were founded on the allegations in an affidavit made in the court of king's bench.&#x2014;The petition was then ordered to lie on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[OFFICES IN REVERSION] Mr. Bankes</member> <membercontribution>rose to submit, pursuant to notice, a motion on the subject of granting offices in reversion. If be might assume, and he hoped be might, that the opinion of the house had undergone no alteration on this point since their late resolution, he thought it would be unnecessary for him to trouble them at any great length, as he might expect an unanimous concurrence in the proposition which he was about to lay before them. It would be waste of time for him to address them at any great length, when he expected no opponent: but because he heard that it had been surmised that the object of the bill passed by the house against the granting of offices in reversion trenched on the just prerogative of the crown, and that it would be of no real service to the public in point of economy, he begged leave to say a few words on these topics.&#x2014;With regard to the prerogative of the crown, he was firmly persuaded that the object of that bill touched upon it but very little, and could not be properly said materially to trench upon it at all. There was at present an opportunity for an undue dissipation in that prerogative, and he was convinced that it would be more full, better exercised, and much more beneficial, if be granting of offices in reversion should be restrained in the manner pointed out by the bill. It would certainly be rather strengthened than weakened, for the gratitude of persons entering upon the reversions, would naturally be small when they considered them in some measure as a vested right, rather than a favour conferred solely for services to the public. There were some instances where these reversions were held by persons perfectly unfit for whatever trust might be attached to the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0610"/>
<col>1159</col>
offices, and more especially in the cases of reversions held by persons of the other sex. The incapacity was, indeed, in some cases so palpable and glaring, that no ministers would have ventured to recommend the grants in the first instance, without the danger of creating the strongest sensation in the public mind, and of exposing themselves to the severest animadversions.&#x2014;But it had been said, that in point of economy this object would be of no advantage to the public. Directly it might not. But certainly the committee expected, and he was persuaded that the expectation was well founded, that the establishment of the principle would ultimately lead to much practical economy. Several offices afforded very large emoluments, while they had no duties attached to them. The committee might judge it proper to review these offices, and see reason to subject some to new regulations, and advise the total abolition of others. But, if, in the mean time, the practice was persisted in of granting these reversions, the labours of the committee would meet with increased difficulties; and parliament seeing no prospect of any immediate benefit from whatever arrangements they could propose, might be more callous and indifferent respecting this important object. On these principles, he presumed, the house had adopted the resolution formerly submitted to it on this subject, and on the same principles concurred unanimously in the provisions of the bill winch he (Mr. Bankes) had the honour to carry up to the house of lords. What the fate of that bill had been, the house had an opportunity of ascertaining from the report of the committee appointed to examine the lords' Journals, for their proceedings upon it. It appeared that it had been put off to a term to which there was no probability that this session would extend, and consequently that it might be considered as totally lost for the present. In order therefore, that no inconvenience might arise to the public service, as the legislative measure had failed, and what had before been the prerogative, might now be considered as in force, he thought it the duty of that house to address his majesty, that he would be graciously pleased not to grant any offices in reversion, till both houses should have an opportunity of considering the subject most fully. It was on this ground he proposed to move the address. It might be thought that it would be better to bring in the bill, but both he, and those

with whom he acted, were of opinion, that the house ought not to resort to any act, which might betray a disposition to usurp the legislative functions of the other house. The constitution had defined the duties of both, and he could not contribute more to the interests of that house, than by confining it within its just and natural limits. It had been suggested to him, therefore, that if a bill were to have been brought in, it might appear to be an attempt to do that by the single act of that house which should be done by the act of the legislature. The mode be proposed to adopt was altogether free from such an objection, and there were several instances on record, in which, whilst enquiries were carried on by that house, it had addressed his majesty to suspend the exercise of certain prerogatives until the result of such enquiries should be known. With such a view he had framed is motion, and if the house was disposed to support the principles when it agreed to the resolution last session, and passed the bill this session, he was convinced that there would be an unanimous concurrence in his motion. He then moved, "that an humble address be presented to his majesty, that he would be graciously pleased not to grant, in any part of his majesty's dominions, any office, place, employment, or salary, in reversion, or for joint lives with benefit of survivorship, until six weeks after the commencement of the next session of parliament." Before the question was put, he had one observation to make, which he would take the liberty to add by way of notice, namely that he meant, in an early period of next session, to move for leave to bring in a similar bill to that which had passed that house this session.&#x2014;On the question being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Hon. J. W. Ward</member> <membercontribution>said it was not his intention to enter upon any long discussion at present, and he now only rose to express that surprise and regret which he could not help feeling at the result of the enquiry of the committee which had been appointed to examine the Journals of the lords, relative to their proceedings upon the Reversion bill. From this it appeared, that that important bill had been rejected. But he could not help being very much surprized at this, because it was an unusual thing that a bill which had met with so very slender an opposition [none, none, from several quarters of the house,]&#x2014;which had met with no opposition in that house, which was directed against public abuses,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0611"/>
<col>1161</col>
an object so peculiarly necessary in the present circumstances of the countrv, should be rejected in the other house. It was a subject of very great regret, too, with him, both on account of the failure of a most important object, and also on account of the indication that was manifested of a want of disposition in the other house to co-operate with the house of commons in restraining the undue expenditure of the public money. Of course, the house could know nothing of the detail of the proceedings in the other house on that bill; and, if it could be known by any indirect means, it would, of course, be irregular to allude to it here. But, one must naturally suppose that it was maturely considered and amply debated in a full house [hear, bear]; that the whole proceedings were conducted with that gravity and serious deliberation which the importance of the case required, that all the ministers of the crown attended in their places, [hear, hear,] as it was their duty to do, in order manfully and openly to oppose the bill, if they thought it an improper one, or to support it with all their strength, if they were of a contrary opinion! It must at least be supposed that if the house was not so full as it might be, their lordships, out of respect to their own character, and a due regard to the unanimous opinion of the house of commons, would have consented to an adjournment of the debate on the bill for a short time, in order to enable those who might be absent to attend their duty! [hear, hear!] It must be supposed that the discussion on so important a bill was not disgraced by an empty house, lest there should be an appearance of gross neglect, insufferable insolence, or some motives of a worse description! Of course the commons could not be supposed to know who proposed the rejection of that bill, or by whom that motion of rejection was supported. But they might be fully assured that it could not have been by a person who was himself in the possession of a reversionary office of great emolument. [hear! hear!] They might be assured it was utterly impossible that the motion rejection could not have been supported by a person who was already gorged with the spoils and plunder of the country;&#x2014;by a person loaded with reversions three deep in his family already. Far less could he suppose, that the motion for its rejection should be seconded by another person, whose name stood recorded in the journals
<col>1162</col>
of the house&#x2014;as one who, with a keen and avaricious eye sat feasting upon the hopes of reversions to himself, his family, and dependents&#x2014;[hear! hear!]&#x2014;or a person whose delight was to hunt after that species of property called by the civilians the <i>hereditas luctuosa</i>. In that house of parliament, which consisted of 400 members, it was quite ridiculous to suppose that only 22 were present at the inglorious and indecent rejection of this bill. He insisted, that notwithstanding the voice of the aristocracy, the house of commons should discharge its duty to the country, and adopt a mode to prevent any thing similar from occurring. He hoped that the house would persevere, and bring forward a similar bill, session after session, until they convinced the house of lords, that the people and the commons of England were not to be trampled upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member> <membercontribution>did not feel any objection to the motion of his hon. friend, and had risen only in consequence of what had fallen from the hon. gent. who had just sat down, to state why he did not object to the present motion, and the grounds of the conduct which he had observed with respect to this measure, when it had been before in its progress through that house. And he thought this the more necessary after the ingenious course which the hon. gent. who had just sat down had taken, by which, in a way certainly perfectly parliamentary, he contrived to throw out the severest animadversions on the servants of the crown. The reason for the non-attendance of the ministers of the crown probably was, that they had not thought the bill of such importance as necessarily to require their attendance. Two opinions seemed to prevail respecting the importance of the bill. Some thought it of vast importance, with a view to purposes of &#x0153;conomy, while others considered it formidable, as trenching on the prerogative of the crown. In neither of these opinions did he concur. He thought there was nothing in it that materially trenched on the prerogative of the crown, for he considered it as a matter of nice calculation, whether it increased or diminished the prerogative. If it diminished it in one view, it certainly increased it in another; and where the matter was so nicely balanced, he did not think there could be any reasonable grounds for supposing that the prerogative could be materially trenched upon. As to the economical effects of the bill, he could
<image src="S1V0009P0I0612"/>
<col>1163</col>
only regard them in the view that had been stated by his hon friend (Mr. Bankes); some offices might in this way be saved for the reward of services. But it ought to be recollected, that this method of reversions was the best way of making provision for the families of meritorious servants of the public, without imposing any new burthens on the public. It was once a mode of providing for lord chancellors, to whom, for instance, the reversion of a tellership of the exchequer might be granted, instead of the provision now in use in such case.<ob/> On the one side, therefore, he thought there was no great advantage to be expected from the bill in point of economy, and on the other he saw no reason to fear any danger to the prerogative of the crown. If it was assumed, that this was a measure of great importance, on one hand, in point of economy, or on the other with a view to an infringement on the prerogative, it certainly might be considered as the duty of the ministers of the crown to attend. But those who adopted neither of these opinions, would of course act as if they considered it as a matter of no uncommon interest. When, therefore, his hon. friend had proposed the measure, he had not thought it necessary to oppose it, but at the same time he did not regard it in that great and favourable light in which it had appeared to others. The hon. gent. over the way, had expressed his surprise at the rejection of the bill, but he saw no reason why he should be surprized at the exercise of its rights by any branch of the legislature. It was the right of the other house, undoubtedly, to reject or approve, and nothing could be more prejudicial to this house than to assume a dictating authority, and to attempt to do by its own act what could only be properly done by an act of the legislature. As to the disgrace imputed by the hon. member, for the manner in which the measure had been disposed of in another place, he should leave that to others to decide. But certainly no person could be more disinterested on such a question, than one who enjoyed an office that had devolved upon him by a reversionary grant. He had never understood that it was in contemplation to deprive such persons of their offices, and he was therefore at a loss to conceive, why persons of that description might not as well as any other persons exercise their discretion upon the general question. The individual to whom the hon. gent. alluded (lord Arden), and of
<col>1164</col>
his connection with whom he had himself <ob/>reason to be proud, had on this and every other occasion exercised his own judgment with a view to the public interest. Nothing could be more unfounded or ridiculous than the statement, not that he had heard in that house, but that had reached his ears from another quarter, that, instead of manfully opposing the measures themselves, ministers had sent others down to reject it. It that statement had made any impression either there or in the country, he was glad to take that opportunity of removing it. There was no candid mind that would not allow, that if he were to be actuated by such feelings, he could never have selected a worse person for the purpose, than one so nearly connected with him as the person that had been alluded to. He was ready, however, distinctly to state, that he certainly had known that it was the intention of that person to oppose the measure, on what appeared to him great constitutional grounds of objection. This he had known from a conversation which he had with that person on the subject, in which that person had expressed surprise that he had suffered the measure to pass that house without opposition. But, if he could not produce any change in that person's opinion, so neither had any been effected in his own, and he admitted that he had felt surprise at the active opposition made to the measure from that quarter. Nothing could be farther from his thoughts than to influence any person on the subject; so far from it, that he had assured his hon. friend in a communication which he had with him since, that whether he should bring forward his motion for an address or not, no act on the part of his majesty's government would be resorted to, that could interfere with his views. Before the present motion was brought, he had given his hon. friend his assurance, that even if he should not bring forward any motion, the practice of granting places in reversion, should be discontinued until the subject should come again fairly before the consideration of parliament. If the motion, however, appeared to him at all to interfere with the just respect due to the other branch of the legislature, he should have resisted it; but it appeared to him to have no such character, he gave it his sincere support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Bouverie</member> expressed great satisfaction at hearing what had fallen from the chancellor of the exchequer. He had this
<image src="S1V0009P0I0613"/>
<col>1165</col>
morning received a letter from his constituents on the very subject now before the house, requesting him to give his <ob/>strenuous support to the revival of the reversion bill; and indeed the feeling was general throughout the whole country.</p>
<p><member>Lord Henry Petty</member><membercontribution> expressed his difference in opinion from the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, as to the importance of the bill to which the motion then before the house <ob/>referred. That right hon. gent. <ob/>as of opinion, that it was a matter of extreme doubt, whether <ob/>the prerogative of the crown received any additional strength, or was diminished by the provisions of that bill; and also, whether considered as a matter of public economy, it was to be considered as being advantageous or disadvantageous to the <ob/>interests of the public. In fact, that right hon. gent. thought it to be so unimportant, that he was rather inclined to believe that he did not attend in his place in that house, on the different discussions which took place upon the subject. Now, <ob/>he (lord H. Petty) was of a very opposite opinion; he did conceive that two most important principles were involved in the consideration of that question. Was it not, in the first place, of some importance, that persons of ability should be appointed to fill different offices in the service of the public; and was it not of some importance also, that the legislature should provide that his majesty should not be deprived of the fair exercise of his prerogative, in selecting such only as he thought qualified to fill the offices? This power, the practice of granting places in reversion might deprive him of, in many instances. And in the second place, was if not of some considerable importance, with a view to public economy that if at any particular time an office should be declared to be useless with respect to public service, and such as ought to be abolished, was it not of some very material importance, that it should be in the power of the servants of the crown to abolish the office upon the office becoming vacant? There was, for instance, a case that occurred last year, in which it would have been well if the measure, which was then spoken of, had been so long in force, as that places were entirely free on the death of the present occupant. The place of Customer of the port of Dublin became vacant by the death of the last officer who filled that place. That was one of the places which it was recommended by the
<col>1166</col>
committee of finance to abolish. The duke of Bedford then lord lieutenant of Ireland, being influenced by the same spirit of economy which actuated the minds of his majesty's confidential advisers in this country, would have abolished the office if it had been in his power so to do; but, he found on enquiry, that a reversion was entailed upon him; he did then all that was in that case left for him to do; he took care that during his administration of the affairs of Ireland, no reversionary interest of that situation should be granted. The right hon. gent., however, stated, with reference to what was supposed to have passed in another place, that a noble lord, who already possessed a reversionary interest, might be considered one of the most fit persons to speak upon the subject. Now, to make out this case, the right hon. gent. should at least have proved, that a person in such a situation must be completely satisfied that the measure of his desires must of course be full. Until he did this, which would be extremely difficult for him to do, he could not support his proposition. Unfortunately, however, for his argument, an instance was glanced at in the course of the debate, in which the person alluded to had two reversionary interests; and it naturally followed that, where this strong desire, for emolument was manifested, the person might very probably be ready to accept a third, or would even have no objection to the acceptance of a fourth for himself or some branch of his family. In every point of view in which he could consider the subject, he thought it to be such as deserved his utmost approbation, and from every additional discussion that it underwent, he was strengthened in his former opinions on this subject. The house had itself declared its opinion almost unanimously, they had done what they conceived to be essential to the public interest, and he hoped that that house, the great inquest of the nation, would continue to proclaim its opinion with all the weight which it carried with it, to the other branch of the legislature, to the crown, and to the country, in the most firm and dignified manner. He hoped that the other house might by next sessions of parliament, view the subject in a more favourable light, and that then the bill would have a better fate.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Sir John Sebright</member> <membercontribution>owed it to his country, to his constituents, and to himself, to declare his full and entire concurrence in the motion of the hon. gent., and he could not
<image src="S1V0009P0I0614"/>
<col>1167</col>
but express his extreme surprise at the manner in which the bill had been disposed of in the other house.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>observed, that the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer had <ob/>now put the question in a different paint of view from that in which it had before been looked at. He gave his support to the present motion in order that the business of reversions might not interfere <ob/>with the labours of the committee of finance. Now, this appeared certainly to throw some new light upon the subject; it was to him matter of information, as the silence of his majesty's present ministers heretofore on this subject would rather have inclined him to believe that they were rather averse to the measure, if it had not been for the words that had been put into the king's speech, recommending the continuation of the finance committee. Then, with these apparent inconsistencies before them, he would beg leave to bring to the recollection of the house, that the only measure which was recommended by the finance committee to be put into execution, was that which passed that house in the form of a bill, which was afterwards lost the other house. It was reported that at least all his majesty's ministers who belonged to that house were not present on that occasion, and indeed the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, confessed that he was not certain whether or not he attended all the discussions that took place an that subject. But now that the right hon. gent. did happen to be in his place when the subject was mentioned, he should have thought it would have been more natural for him to have defended the measure on the principle itself, on the same ground that it might be supposed to have been recommended in the speech from the throne. However, at the same time he must declare, that he most cordially agreed with the right hon. gent., that if there had been any thing like a trick in the business; if there had been any thing of management in the matter, the noble relation of that right hon. gent. was, of all others, the most improper person to select for giving the measure any kind of secret opposition in another place. But the right hon. gent. considered it to be one of those indifferent, milk-and-water measures that it was hardly worth his attention; however, to oblige his hon. friend (Mr. Bankes) when he did speak upon it, he gave it a sort of cold support. There was one circumstance, how-
<col>1168</col>
ever, that was to him a matter of extreme surprise, which happened to escape the notice of his hon. friend (Mr. Ward); it was to him matter of extreme surprise, if it could be possible that the lord chancellor, who delivered the speech in the name of his majesty, in which the labours of the committee of finance were most graciously noticed; if it were possible that the same lord chancellor could afterwards ever have thought of opposing the first fruits of their labour, which was brought before him in the form of a legislative proceeding. It would also be to him a matter of extraordinary surprise, if he should be told that a noble lord, who could not certainly be a stranger to official proceedings, taking up a paper, and on looking at it, expressed his surprise most innocently, saying, "Oh! dear; so the reversion bill has been rejected in the lords!" If he should happen to be informed of such circumstances, he must confess that he should be a good deal surprised. But then, some said that the measure would trench on the royal prerogative, and therefore it was objectionable. Now, he did not hesitate to say, that with him an objection of that sort had very little weight, as he was decidedly of opinion, that in many instances the prerogative of the crown, inasmuch as it obtained influence, ought to be diminished. Some gentlemen, however, took it in another view, and talked of coercing the other house of parliament. This was what could not bear a serious answer&#x2014;to talk of coercing them was ridiculous. But so much would he say, that it was the acknowledged right and duty of the house of commons, to guard the public purse; and that, as guardians of the public purse, they ought, in a measure of finance, which was peculiarly their province, to persevere until they might possibly at length convince the other house of the strength and propriety of their arguments. He should be glad, if it were possible, that a resolution should be framed, expressive of what appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the house on this subject, that it should be carried up to the house of lords, and that their lordships should then be called upon deliberately to express their opinion on it.&#x2014;The question was then put on Mr. Bankes's motion, which was carried, <i>nem. con</i>.; and it was ordered that the address should be presented to his majesty by such members of that house as are also members of his majesty's privy council.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[GENERAL STATE OF AFFAIRS.]</member> <membercontribution>On the motion, that this house at its rising do adjourn to Thursday next,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>rose. He observed, that this country being at present surrounded by the most gloomy prospects which perhaps ever offered to any nation, events were not unlikely to occur which might induce irremediable distress, if the utmost vigour and vigilance were not employed by all the departments of the state to avert the evils that menaced us. In such a crisis, of course, he deprecated the prorogation of parliament; pregnant, as the crisis was, with events which might render it peculiarly desirable for prudent ministers to resort to parliament for advice. He hoped, therefore, it was not intended by ministers to advise his majesty to prorogue parliament on Friday next, as rumour stated. Among the causes of gloom and alarm which this country at present witnessed, the hon. gent. noticed the state of our relations with a particular power&#x2014;he meant Turkey; with regard to which, that house and the country were really unable precisely to decide whether we were at peace, or whether we were at war. An ambassador had been appointed to that state, and yet what was the nature of our connexion with it, or our future prospect regarding it, was quite uncertain. But he did not propose to press any embarrassing questions upon his majesty's ministers as to this topic. There were, however, other points upon which he was anxious, in common with the country at large, to receive all the information which ministers could consistently afford. The first and most important was with respect to the Russian treaty. In that treaty he observed an article specifically referring to the mediation of Russia between this country and France. Now, he wished to know whether any direct communication had been received from the court of Petersburgh, in consequence of this article? At the same time, he could not help observing, that there was something in the present juncture peculiarly favourable for the restoration of peace upon honourable terms, if ministers dexterously availed themselves of it. Thinking so, he strongly recommended ministers to accept the proposal of negociation; and, if they would enter upon it in the spirit of peace, he had no doubt that it would terminate in the establishment of that invaluable blessing; but if ministers proceeded upon a different spirit, he had serious fears that it would lead to great and permanent
<col>1170</col>
calamity.&#x2014;The next point upon which the hon. gent. felt extremely anxious for information, was with regard to America: whether communication had been made by the American government upon the subject of a recent event on the American coast; and whether any steps had been taken by ministers in consequence of such communication? This was a question with regard to which the country felt extremely interested, and particularly as to the probable result. These were the two important points upon which he thought it his duty to apply to ministers for information, not only for the satisfaction of that house, but of the country. But with regard to the proposed prorogation, the hon. gent. called the attention of ministers to other important considerations, which appeared to him strongly to forbid that proceeding so early as was expected. According to the conditions of the Prussian treaty, it was stipulated that our commerce should be excluded from all the ports subject to that power, and it was understood that, in consequence of that stipulation, a large expedition had been sent out, with an object in view which exposed us to the liability of having a new enemy. The probability even of such an event ought, in his opinion, strongly to impress upon the minds of ministers, the impropriety of proroguing parliament, particularly as that probability must, in the nature of things, be so soon determined. While the result of such a proceeding was suspended, and with a just impression of the consequences, should the result be unfavourable, it would obviously be wise in any ministers to keep parliament together, in order that they might occasionally resort to the aid of its counsel. But, there were many other reasons which should impress this advice upon ministers. Among others, the incidents which might arise either out of a negociation for peace, or a continuance of war&#x2014;the consequences which might result from the state of our present relations with America, and from the nature of our prospects with other powers; all of which it might be proper and necessary immediately to communicate to parliament, enforced time propriety of postponing the prorogation. But another, and a forcible reason for such postponement, was suggested by the present alarming situation of our West-India trade, through which we were likely to have so considerable a portion of our revenue cut off, and with regard to which, immediate
<image src="S1V0009P0I0616"/>
<col>1171</col>
proceedings ought of course to be taken by parliament. Under all these circumstances, the hon. gent. expressed his hope and wish, that ministers would not attempt to counsel his majesty to prorogue the parliament so soon as was reported.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Canning</member> <membercontribution>rose, and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;I do not rise, sir, for the purpose of offering any argument to justify the exercise of his majesty's prerogative, with regard to the prorogation of parliament, or to state the reasons which may influence his servants in the counsels which they may deem it advisable to offer upon such a subject. Any attempt at that sort of justification is, according to my judgement, in the present instance, totally unnecessary. But I rise to make such replies to the hon. member's questions, as I feel consistent with my public duty; and I am happy that I do feel enabled to afford a full answer upon those points to which the hon. gent. appears to attach the most importance. First, then, as to Russia; the hon. gent.'s interrogatory is&#x2014;whether any direct communication has been received from the court of St. Petersburgh, conformably to a certain article in the treaty recently concluded between that country and France? Undoubtedly, a direct communication has been received from the Russian court, by his majesty's government, containing an offer of mediation between this country and France. But, I think it right, at the same time to state that this communication was unaccompanied by any copy of the treaty lately concluded, or any of its conditions&#x2014;but specifically not the article alluded to by the hon member. This communication was received on the 2d of this month, and at that time his majesty's ministers had no knowledge whatever of the terms of the Russian treaty; but least of all of a certain article in that treaty. Nor had they, indeed, any intelligence upon the subject, until they received it through the same medium as that which conveyed it to the public, namely, a French newspaper. Under these circumstances, ministers received the communication I have mentioned from Russia, and to that communication; they returned, what in such a state of things must have been expected, only a conditional answer. What the nature of that answer was, the hon. gent. will not ask me to state; but I can assure him, that the answer of ministers was given in the most perfect ignorance of the Russian treaty, and particularly of the article alluded to by the hon. gent.&#x2014;The
<col>1172</col>
next interrogatory of the hon. gent. alluded to America: now, upon this point, I can have no difficulty in communicating to the house and to the public, the fullest information in my power; and I am peculiarly glad of the opportunity which the hon. gent. has afforded me of so doing. But, before I enter into the transaction to which the hon. member's question more particularly refers, I beg to state, that any circumstances which may have occurred with regard to America, can, in no degree, have arisen out of the conduct of his present ministers. For this reason, that finding upon their accession to office, certain relations subsisting between this country and America&#x2014;finding a treaty pending, though not yet ratified, and the public faith of this country solemnly pledged&#x2014;they felt no duty so sacred.&#x2014;they saw no line so clear, as not to interfere with the course of these relations; but to proceed according to the impulse given by their predecessors. Whatever our own feelings were upon the merits of the measure, we felt it our duty, and formed our resolution, to give the fullest effect to the stipulations of the treaty which our predecessors had concluded; such, in fact, both collectively and individually, was our determined purpose. Under these considerations, I can assure the house that no alteration whatever was made in the course pursued by our predecessors&#x2014;nothing whatever was done that could bear on their treaty, or the objects they had in view. No new instructions whatever were sent to our minister at the American court; and as to our naval force off the American coast, they had precisely the same orders as those which prevailed under our predecessors. Upon the conduct of that force, I cannot as yet attempt to pronounce an opinion. Until a recent transaction shall be enquired into, and the fullest and most accurate examination shall take place, it would be premature to decide upon it. But, whatever the conduct of this naval force, or the nature of this particular transaction may have been, the present ministers are no more responsible for it than as the representatives of the government. In the present stage of the business, I have nothing more to say upon this question but to add, that the British government have not received, either through its minister at the American court, or through the American ambassador here, any official communication whatever relative to the transaction alluded to by the hon. gent.
<image src="S1V0009P0I0617"/>
<col>1173</col>
Ministers received the first authentic account of this affair through the American newspapers, transmitted by our minister, which contained the president's proclamation, and in consequence of this publication I thought it my duty, no later than this day, to enquire of the American ambassador, whether he had any official communication from his government to make upon the subject; but was answered in the negative. In such circumstances, of course, ministers have no communication to make to parliament on this topic.&#x2014;Upon these two points, with regard to which the hon. gent. professed to be particularly anxious, I have endeavoured to answer as fully and satisfactorily as my duty enabled me to do. With respect to the other points to which the hon. gent. referred, the house must feel that it would be impossible for me, consistently, to state any thing with regard to the measures which he supposes ministers to have taken in consequence of the Prussian Treaty with France, or as to the object of the expedition which government has lately sent out; particularly as no intelligence has as yet been received from that expedition. Upon another subject of the hon. gent.'s allusion, I mean Turkey, I shall only repeat the words of his majesty's speech at the commencement of the session, namely, "that his majesty has taken such measures, as may best enable him to take advantage of any favourable opportunity for bringing the hostilities in which he is engaged against the Sublime Porte, to a conclusion, consistent with his majesty's honour and the interests of his ally."&#x2014;The right hon. gent. observed, that he had communicated as fully upon all the points adverted to by the hon. gent. as he was enabled to do consistently with his duty. Having no official communication to make to parliament; seeing no probability of an event that should render an immediate communication with parliament necessary, and considering that the public business was over, he could not conceive the reason of acceding to a principle so new, as that of continuing the attendance of members&#x2014;of preventing a prorogation, particularly at the present season, when, according to the ordinary practice of parliament, his majesty exercised his unquestionable prerogative in allowing to both houses a certain recess.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Whitbread</member> <membercontribution>expressed himself obliged to the right hon. secretary for the candour with which he had answered the
<col>1174</col>
questions he had thought it his duty to ask, but disclaimed any intention to interrogate the right hon. gent. as to those points, which he could not be consistently expected to answer&#x2014;he meant particularly with respect to the destination of the expedition. With regard to his majesty's prerogative to prorogue parliament, he had no intention whatever to question it. But at the same time he must repeat, that the exercise of it in this instance, under the circumstances which he had stated, would be extremely ill advised.&#x2014;The motion, that the house should at its rising adjourn till Thursday, was then agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>said, he should move, that the bill, instead of being read a second time now, be read a second time this day 3 months: first, because he thought the preamble of the bill absolute nonsense; secondly, because many of the motives alleged for introducing it, as well as the allegations upon which it was founded, were not true in the extent alleged, and were, in many respects, highly objectionable; and, thirdly, because the subject was one which, in its various bearings, called for more serious and deliberate discussion than was practicable at the present period of the session, to justify their lordships in its adoption. He would not deny, that education to the lower orders of the community, in the extent proposed, under proper directions and limitations, might be desirable; but he could not agree with the framers of the bill, that education, blended with morality, was more extended amongst the lower classes of the Scotch population, than amongst those of this country; for, however superior the Scotch might be in the former, he could not admit their superiority in the latter. He objected also to the bill, because it did not propose to place instruction more upon a religious footing; and though it was certainly less objectionable now than in its original form, which rendered the plans it proposed compulsory upon the parishes throughout the kingdom, yet the modification was, in his view, not much less inadmissible; for it placed the adoption of such schools at the sole discretion of the majority of parishioners in number, without any reasonable
<image src="S1V0009P0I0618"/>
<col>1175</col>
discrimination of rank and property, in the parish, which certainly ought, in such a matter, to have their proportionate weight, and the want of which would be a subject of constant dispute and division.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>thought the bill, in the form it had reached this house, was so totally devoid of all possible ground for objection, that he was surprized at the hostility of his noble friend. He did not think the preamble liable to the objection that it was nonsense. In substance, at least, it was indisputably true; and the mere error of a single word might be remedied in a committee. He should have thought it an insult to the understanding of the house to go into elaborate arguments, for the purpose of proving that educating the people would improve their morals and their comforts; and as to the argument of want of time to discuss so important a subject at this period of the session, this was one among the many instances which had already occurred to falsify the pompous assertions of his majesty's ministers, and the public papers in their interest, that the late dissolution could cause no material interruption to the public business, nor impede any of those great and salutary public measures to which the country looked, and of which this bill was certainly one.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Redesdale</member> <membercontribution>disapproved highly of the bill in its present shape, though, with his noble friend, he cherished the principle, that a good system of education properly regulated would be of great public utility. His principal objection to the present bill seemed to be the little reference it had, in his view of it, to the religious establishments of the country. Such a principle should, in considerations of the kind, be kept primarily in view. To some of the provisions of the bill he also strongly objected. The enactments had no reference to the extent of the parish. Some parishes, particularly in the northern counties, were 25 miles long, and 14 or 15 broad. A great number of the parishioners, therefore, could reap no possible benefit from the establishment of one school. Besides, the bill would go to interfere with several scholastic establishments of private institution, which were now productive of great benefit in different parts of the country. In Ireland there was a legal provision, which, he regretted, was so ill attended to; that the parish ministers should either themselves keep a school, or appoint a Schoolmaster directly for the instruction of
<col>1176</col>
the parishes. In that case, the instructors were, either directly, or indirectly, the ministers of the established religion. This principle was not sufficiently attended to in the present bill, and was, with him, a strong ground for its rejection. Almost all its provisions were likely to be productive of much practical mischief, if the bill passed in its present shape, without the least probability of its being attended with any new benefit. Viewing the bill in this light, he must agree with the noble secretary of state, who moved that the consideration of it be postponed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>opposed the bill in its present shape, though he was by no means unfriendly to the principle of diffusing instruction as generally and as widely as possible. He was fully sensible of the benefits arising from the system of education in Scotland, and as he himself was one of the borderers on that part of the country, he felt himself indebted to that system for the benefit of his own education: still, he could not approve of the present bill, because it was miserably deficient in the means of accomplishing the great object which it seemed to have in view. Besides, it tended to a departure from the great principle of instruction in this country, by taking it in a great measure out of the superintendance and controul of the clergy. Nor were these his only objections; in whatever shape any bill of the kind might appear, he never would agree to any that left matters of this nature to be judged or and decided by the majority of the inhabitants of a parish. To what confusion might not such a mode of decision open a door? Would it not give rise to all the mischiefs of an election, among the majority of the inhabitants of every parish, of whatever description of people they might be composed? What endless litigations! Had there not been, not long since, an example of it in the election of a minister for the parish of Clerkenwell; and had not that contention lasted 7 years at the bar of this house? He had also to object to the clause, which gave to the court of chancery the disposal of the money for these establishments, when it amounted to a certain sum. It should be recollected, how such sums so entrusted were sweated in that court, and how in the end, when the oyster came to be divided, the real owner got nothing but the shells. He could never, therefore, assent to the bill in its present form.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Archbishop of Canterbury</member> <membercontribution>trusted he
<image src="S1V0009P0I0619"/>
<col>1177</col>
should not be considered as hostile to the principle of diffusing instruction among the poor, although he should oppose the further progress of this measure. In his opinion, the framers of it had no conception of the vastness of the task they had undertaken. Something widely different, indeed, must be done to further and accomplish the object which they seemed to have in view. He had himself bestowed of late no small degree of attention upon this subject, and he proposed to himself to follow it up to a certain extent. His enquiries had already embraced a large district, and for the satisfaction of the house he could affirm, that the advantages of education were extended more generally than it appeared to be thought, and he would venture to say, that in the parish alone in which he resided, these advantages extended to no less a number than 4000. Perhaps, when his plan was more matured, he should have the honour of submitting it to their lordships. In the mean time, he must agree with the noble and learned lords who preceded him, and who truly observed, that the provisions of the bill left little or no controul to the minister in his parish. This would go to subvert the first principles of education in this country, which had hitherto been, and he trusted would continue to be, under the controul and auspices of the establishment, and their lordships would feel how dangerous it might be to innovate in such matters. Their lordships' prudence would, no doubt, guard against innovations that might shake the foundation of our religion, and it would be a chief object of their vigilance and care, "ut cast&#x00E2; maneant in religione nepotes."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Stanhope</member> <membercontribution>was sorry to differ from the right reverend prelate, and several other persons in that house, on wat he must call the abominable principle, that no part of the population of this country ought to receive education unless in the tenets of the established church. Was it reasonable or just to say that the children of catholics, presbyterians, quakers, and all the other innumerable sects of dissenters from the established church in this country, were to be debarred all sources of public education, supported by public benevolence, unless they were to become converts to our established religion? Would the right rev. prelate contend, that because the catholic religion was the established one in Canada, no poor Protestants should be educated there unless he was allowed to be
<col>1178</col>
brought up a catholic. The noble lord upon the woolsack objected to this bill, lest it might lead to litigation in the court of chancery; he himself had no very great wish to promote litigations in that court; be once had a suit in the chancery of Ireland, which had lasted <i>only</i> 42 years; he had once voted upon an appeal in that house from a chancery suit in England, which had <i>only</i> lasted 500 years, and he was of opinion that the tedious progress and procrastinated decisions of that court, were well described by the story of a man, who, insettling a contest between two beggars aboutan oyster, took the fish to himself, and gave a shell to each of the parties. But, while he entertained no such fears for the result of this bill, he could not see that its purpose had any thing to do with sects of religion. It was merely to teach its objects spelling, reading, writing, and arithmetic for purposes useful in life; and in a manufacturing country like this, when so much of excellence in our productions depended on a clear understanding and some degree of mathematical and mechanical knowledge, which it was impossible to attain without first receiving the rudiments and foundation this bill proposed, the superiority of workmen with some education, over those who had none, must be sensibly felt by all the great manufacturers in the country. His lordship was for committing the bill, rendering it as perfect as possible, sending it forth to the public in that shape, and taking it up again for completion in the next session.&#x2014;The question was then put on lord Hawkesbury's motion and carried without a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>[IRISH ARMS BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The house resolved itself into a committee on the Irish Arms bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Holland</member> <membercontribution>thought it singular that they should have arrived at this stage of a bill of such great importance, without any reasons being alleged to prove the necessity of the measure. Not four-and-twenty hours had elapsed since they had been considering bills, the objects of which were to contribute to arm a large portion of the people, in order to meet the exigencies of the country, and now it formed a singular contrast that they were in a committee on a bill for disarming a large portion of his majesty's subjects in Ireland. He could not suffer a bill of this nature to be proceeded in without again calling the attention of the house to the causes of those discontents which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0620"/>
<col>1179</col>
rendered these measures of coercion necessary. He did not wish to go over at length the grounds he had before taken when another bill was before the house, but he could not help urging the importance of conciliatory measures as the best mode of allaying the discontents of a large portion of the population of Ireland. When discontents existed amongst a large portion of the people of Scotland, it was proposed to sir Robert Walpole to enlist them into regiments in the service of the country, and give the commands to the principal families who were then hostile to the government. The idea was eagerly seized by that great statesman, but was rejected by the cabinet. Many of those persons afterwards joined the standard of the rebellion. When, however, subsequently, a milder and more conciliatory policy was adopted, that people became loyal and zealous in the service of their country; and finally, all the measures which had been thought necessary to enact were repealed in the administration of the great earl of Chatham. Similar results offered themselves in Hungary, where a large portion of the people, in consequence of being of a religion different from the established church, were kept under degrading restraints that necessarily produced discontents. When, however, those restraints were put an end to, the utmost loyalty and zeal prevailed. With respect to the bill, he thought it placed by far too great powers in the hands of the magistracy of Ireland. The reason which induced him reluctantly to give his consent to a bill recently passed, did not operate in the present instance; that was a measure only to be used in case of necessity; but the present bill was to be continually operating, and might in many instances produce great oppression and hardships, particularly by the powers given to search for arms by night. He did not mean to say, that there might not be cases in which it might be necessary to take arms out of the hands of disaffected persons, but the present bill was in his opinion inadequate to its purpose, as it would operate to produce a greater concealment; the best Mode he thought would be to compel the magistrates to keep a registry of arms, and to grant licences for keeping them. He thought, however, that the bill recently passed for suppressing Insurrections, gave amply sufficient powers to the government, and he did not see the necessity of passing this bill in addition. He should therefore more, that the chair-
<col>1180</col>
man do leave the chair, meaning afterwards to move to postpone the bill for three months, conceiving that as it could not be many months before parliament would again assemble, there would then be ample time for discussing this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury </member><membercontribution>said, he had not introduced the bill with any arguments in support of it, because it contained nothing new in its principle or provisions, and not many weeks had elapsed since the principle of this bill had been distinctly recognized by the late administration, who proposed a bill for continuing an act commonly called the Gunpowder act, and which contained provisions equally oppressive, if so they could be called, with the present bill. That bill was passed by which the act was continued for 7 years, whilst it was only proposed to continue the present act for two years. His noble friend had been unfortunate in his allusion to Scotland, as in that country the acts of restraint and coercion had continued for 50 years, and it was only by a steady course of government upon these principles, that the discontents there were at length put an end to; but then they could not be made the subjects of party politics here, as the sources of these discontents was, in this part of the Island, treason. With respect,. however, to mild and conciliatory measures, nothing could have satisfied the discontented in that country, but the restoration of the Pretender. It was only by a steady system of government, together with old prejudices wearing away, that at length the necessity for measures of coercion ceased, and the population of Scotland had since served his majesty with the utmost bravery and loyalty. The circumstances of the two countries were, however, Materially different. It was only of late years that Scotland had been trusted with a national militia, whilst in Ireland there had long been a national militia of high character; and there was a brave and loyal yeomanry; a great number of the population of Ireland were likewise enlisted in the army. He did not wish to enter into a long, discussion of the subject; he should merely observe, that wherever discontents existed, those discontents we re not likely to be decreased by being made the subject of party politics. The necessity of this bill, from what was known of the state of Ireland, he conceived to be obvious.&#x2014;The motion for the chairman leaving the chair being negatived,</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0621"/>
<col>1181</col>
<p><member>Lord Hardwicke</member> <membercontribution>proposed an amendment, for the better promulgation of this law; as he conceived, that in the manner the laws were now promulgated in Ireland, many persons would be completely ignorant of the provisions of this act.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Redesdale</member> <membercontribution>said, that the registering of arms had been so long the law of Ireland, that it was impossible they could be ignorant of the most important parts of this act. He relied upon the moderation of the magistracy for not abusing the power vested in them.&#x2014;The amendment was negatived, and the bill passed through the committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[MILITIA TRANSFER BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The order of the day being read for the third reading of this bill,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>rose chiefly with a view to re-state the opinion he had on a former occasion expressed of the tendency of this measure, and to correct a misconception of it, which some noble lords seemed to labour under. It was acknowledged by his noble friend (lord Hawkesbury), that it had lately been matter of consideration with his majesty's ministers, whether at the present crisis it were better to resort to the principle of the Army of Reserve bill, or to adopt the new one now under discussion. Much enquiry was said to have been made respecting the subject; but after mature deliberation, the opinions of the cabinet prevailed in favour of the present measure. He also had instituted enquiries into the matter; the result of which most completely decided his preference to the principle of the Army of Reserve bill. The country was now almost precisely in the same situation as that in which it was placed in 1803, when that bill was adopted. The crisis at present was perhaps more urgent, and the state of the continent less favourable; but, still, under such circumstances would he have looked to the operation of the Army of Reserve act. The beneficial effects of that act became more visible every day, and promised the fairest success; but it was thought proper to substitute a measure in its room, which at the end of 20 months did not produce more than 8000 men. The noble viscount then entered into a comparative statement of the operation of the two acts, the Army of Reserve and the Additional Force bills, which he compared with that now under discussion, and declared it to be his conviction, that there
<col>1182</col>
could not be a moment's hesitation in preferring the principle of the Army of Reserve bill. The success of the measure was at best but contingent. It would avail but little, unless peace were concluded within 5 years at farthest. With what probability such an event could be looked for, he was unable to conjecture. Now, the whole benefit to be expected from its fullest success was that it would raise 28,000 men for the line, and thus far increase our disposable force; that he confessed to be no small advantage, if it could be acquired to that extent, which, however, he doubted: but, even if it did so far succeed, still the advantage was too dearly bought by injuring an establishment of 77,000 men, or rather by unhinging or perhaps destroying that constitutional force altogether&#x2014;and to answer what end? to increase our defensive force? and was not the militia a main portion of our defensive force? and would not the present bill tend to frustrate all the hopes that could reasonably be reposed in that body, an excellent body of men as it now stood? but what might it become when 28,000 of its best disciplined men were suddenly withdrawn from it? He must protest most seriously and solemnly against the adoption of such a measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member> <membercontribution>acknowledged having said that it was matter of deliberation with ministers, which of the two measures they should prefer, and the present was not resolved upon without full conviction of its being preferable under all the circumstances of our situation. It was allowed by the noble viscount, that the bill might in a great measure, if not fully, accomplish its object, but that still its benefit was contingent. Granted. But what was the wish of government? Was it not to meet the pressure and diminish the evil of the present moment; and how? by increasing our defensive and disposable force. This, then, would be, in some degree, accomplished, even in the view of the noble viscount: and so far then it would succeed. But he had little or no doubt of its complete success, and then our military means would have received a very great increase indeed. For those who well understood the condition of a soldier, and of a disposable force, would readily acknowledge that by such an addition to it as that of 28,000 men, not only was our defensive force considerably increased, but also considerably strengthened, which was a distinction not to be overlooked.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0622"/>
<col>1183</col>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>did not think that his habits authorized him to aspire to great military knowledge; but, he would, however, venture to concur with the noble viscount (Sidmouth) in giving the most ample praise in favour of the Army of Reserve act. At the time it was brought forward, that act had most certainly his concurrence, and even now he did not hesitate to say, that it was one of the most able military plans that had ever been produced in this country; but while he made that acknowledgement, he must also observe, that there was room to think otherwise of that measure at present. It was not so well adapted now to the crisis of affairs, and it should be remembered, that the effects which at first it might have produced must now be considerably altered, not only by the change of the actual circumstances of the country, but by the operation of the other different measures that had since been introduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Mulgrave</member> <membercontribution>thought the noble viscount had laid too much stress upon a distinction between a disposable and defensive force. No doubt, a disposable force was also a defensive one; but from every kind of defensive force, the same services, the same resources, could not, under all the circumstances that might call for these services, be reasonably expected. He however, of opinion, that at a moment like the present, there was no room to hesitate between the two plans.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>in explanation, again insisted that the principle he laid down was, that the advantages gained by the bill would be more than counterbalanced by the inconveniences that must arise.&#x2014;The bill was then read a third time.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>[DISPUTE WITH AMERICA.] Earl Stanhope</member> <membercontribution>rose to make the motion of which he had given notice, respecting a resolution that all independent nations should be treated upon the principle of perfect equality and complete reciprocity. In proposing this resolution to the house, he had not merely in his eye the circumstances in which we now stood with regard to America; the principle to which he alluded should, in his opinion, be extended to all states and nations indiscriminately. He could not help noticing the absence of ministers on this occasion; but he had already occasion to observe that they seemed
<col>1184</col>
anxious to avoid all discussion on this topic. He would not say that their conduct was not prudent; but, whatever it might be, he felt it incumbent on him to express his sentiments, when the voice of an imperious duty called upon him to express them. He must, therefore, most earnestly deprecate a rupture with America, and the house would, no doubt, unite with him in deprecating that calamity, when they duly considered the many difficulties and dangers with which we were already beset. They must recollect that in times of scarcity our principal relief was derived, first from Poland, next from America. Poland was now shut against us by the influence of the enemy; would we also shut against ourselves the ports of America by our own folly? Whence were we to derive materials and stores for our naval arsenal, if the north of Europe and North America were to refuse us these supplies? Where was the greatness and security of England, when our navy, the source of our pride, the source of our strength and wealth, was gone? These were serious considerations. He should now only remark, that as all individuals, whether high or low, poor or rich, were the same in the eye of God, so nations, whether powerful or weak, whether opulent or poor, should be the same in the contemplation of the law of nations. This was the principle upon which his motion rested, and upon which he grounded the resolution he had now to move. The noble lord then concluded with moving, "that it be resolved, that the principle upon which we should act towards independent nations at peace with the British government, should be a principle of perfect equality and complete reciprocity."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> <membercontribution>could not but commend the serious manner in which the noble earl had expressed himself on topics of such importance. As however, no authentic documents were before the house, to guide an opinion upon matters of such magnitude, he thought it more prudent not to agitate them under such circumstances. The noble earl would therefore, he hoped, excuse him for moving the previous question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Stanhope </member>, <membercontribution>in explanation, thanked the noble and learned lord for his kind attention, and observed that what he advanced, not only referred to the present state of America, but to all independent nations, at all times, when at peace with us.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Earl Morton</member> <membercontribution>objected to the motion, as tending to legislate, upon abstract principles
<image src="S1V0009P0I0623"/>
<col>1185</col>
which was contrary to the spirit and the practice of parliament.&#x2014;The question was then put, and the previous question was carried without a division.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF COMMONS.</title>
<date format="1807-08-13">Thursday, August 13.</date>
<p><member>[STATE OF IRELAND.] Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>rose to make his promised motion, and spoke in substance as follows: I rise, sir, under some degree of apprehension that, from the lateness of the hour, and the quantity of less important business which the house has already gone through, I may be felt to trespass on your attention: but it was, I assure you, not less my intention this night, than it was on Monday, to address you at a much earlier hour of the evening, had other business permitted. The lateness of the hour on Monday was, indeed, one of the causes which induced me to postpone my motion until this evening; and I cannot but regret that on this, the last day, nay almost the last hour of the sessions, it should become necessary for me to arrest your attention; because I know that at such a time to delay your sitting cannot be agreeable to your feelings or to your habits. I am aware that it must have somewhat of an ungracious appearance to postpone your separation at such a season; and, believe me, I am as willing to enjoy the benefits of that separation as any one among you; but I am too strongly impelled by a call of imperious duty to yield to any desire of accommodation. The necessity which gave rise to that call, was not created by me&#x2014;nor was the postponement of the proposition I am about to submit, from Monday to this late period, by any means my fault. The propriety of adopting it, is to my conviction rendered perfectly obvious by the circumstances of the two bills which you have recently passed with regard to Ireland. When you have determined to suspend the constitution and laws of Ireland, is it not reasonable to propose to you some enquiry into the causes alleged for such suspension, and how far such causes are removable&#x2014;is it not wise, when you are sending such acts to Ireland, to communicate at the same time some assurances of your resolution to take the state of that country into your consideration? I am confident that such conduct would be at once consistent with policy and humanity, and that much of the apprehension and irritation which acts of parliament may be naturally expected to
<col>1186</col>
produce, would be mitigated if accompanied by the adoption of a motion of the nature of that which I hold in my hand.&#x2014;With regard to the intentions entertained by the last administration, to propose two acts similar to those I allude to, or to the character of the persons to whom the execution of the extraordinary powers which these acts confer might be intrusted, by either the late or the present governments, it is my intention to say very little indeed. Because I do not wish to touch upon any topic of irritation, I will not enter much into comparisons. My hope and desire is, to obtain an unanimous assent to the motion, as unanimity is necessary to give it complete effect. I shall abstain cautiously from any thing that resembles invidious distinction. I know that to no set of men could power have been more safely confided than to the members of the late administration. I am sure that in the hands of none would power have been less liable to abuse; and whatever my disinclination to comparison may be, to them cannot be denied this just distinction, that power might have been granted to them with the less reluctance, as they manifested a disposition to accompany its existence by every means of concession and conciliation. When I reflect in whom the power of these acts was to have been invested in Ireland&#x2014;when I consider that it was to have been exercised by the duke of Bedford, who was not likely to call it into action, unless the necessity was irresistible, and who was in no case likely to abuse it, I must feel that he was peculiarly entitled to confidence. The character of that nobleman formed a guarantee against the apprehension of abused authority. But I have a great respect for his successor also (the duke of Richmond), I know that nobleman well enough, to be certain that he has no disposition to cruelty&#x2014;that he has no malignant passion to gratify, and that he is above being affected by that gloomy suspicion, or party rancour, which might unnecessarily call for the execution, and materially embitter the operation of such power as these acts ordain. I have no doubt that this nobleman will follow the wise example&#x2014;will he actuated by the same liberal principles which served to render his illustrious predecessor so much the object of panegyric and attachment. I should not, therefore, be very materially influenced as to a comparison of persons in power, as to my opinion the very unconstitutional powers which
<image src="S1V0009P0I0624"/>
<col>1187</col>
characterize these bills. I am adverse to the principle of such measures, and could never be persuaded to accede to them, unless the necessity were strong and glaring indeed.&#x2014;Upon Monday last I had an opportunity of shewing my motion to several gentlemen on both sides of the house, and had the satisfaction of observing a general disposition to concur in its principle and object. But some gentlemen expressing a wish for time to consider its structure and tendency, I was therefore for postponing the motion until this day, influenced by the request of those who required such time, in the hope that consideration would serve to remove their doubts and secure their support. In this opinion at least, I acquiesced in the proposed delay, hoping that the effect of it would be to produce the proposition perhaps of some remedy for any defect in the motion, and that delay and deliberation must determine every man in favour of its main object. Retaining still a little of that hope and opinion, I do not think it necessary to take up much of your time, by entering into a detail of the reasons which have induced me to bring forward the motion, and which should urge you to adopt it. Indeed, I cannot conceive a ground upon which the rejection of such a motion can be justified, and I am not bound to conjure up objections or anticipate arguments, upon the strength of which no reasoning man can rely. It is impossible that any thinking man should seriously insist upon as an objection to my motion, that which I have heard on other occasions, namely, that danger was to be apprehended from the discussion of such affairs in this house; that it is a topic which ought to be touched as little and as seldom as possible. But I deprecate such a ground of opposition, as full of error and mischief. For, assuredly, until we get completely rid of the folly and fallacy of such an objection, it will be quite impossible for us to apply a remedy to the disorders of that country, and for this obvious reason, that we cannot know the nature of those disorders. What! that we should go on legislating for Ireland in the dark&#x2014;that we should reject light and information upon a subject to which we are called upon to apply the law&#x2014;and that law too most penal and severe in its character!&#x2014;When I hear ministers of the crown declaring without shame, that they know nothing of the state of Ireland&#x2014;when I hear the same declaration
<col>1188</col>
from the law-officers, when, in fact, no man can speak decisively upon the subject, is it possible, I would ask, to devise a stronger argument than such declared, ignorance suggests, to urge the united parliament to an investigation of this important question? It is not consistent with even the decent appearance of respect for the rights, interests, and liberties of the people of Ireland to legislate for that country in such total ignorance, or at least such inconsistent contradictory information as we have before us. We have heard one set of gentlemen assert that Ireland is perfectly tranquil, loyal, and united; and this assertion is corroborated by the authority of a noble lord (Hawkesbury) in another place; and with such authority before us, is it right that the constitution of Ireland should be suspended? But, farther, in support of the allegation that Ireland is undisturbed, and requires not such an act, I find that in a very populous county, where disaffection was supposed to exist, I mean Tipperary, judge Fox at the late assizes congratulated the people upon the state of the calendar, upon the acknowledged tranquillity of the district, and upon the general good order of the county. I find that not a single charge of disloyalty, sedition, or treason, was to be seen on the calendar throughout the county. I find at Kilkenny the public resolutions of the Grand Jury testifying, not only the peaceable disposition of the county, but a general and cordial harmony between Protestants and Catholics, with a strong declaration from a body of the former in favour of the claims of the latter. All these testimonies appear on the one side; on the other, to be sure, we have a very high authority&#x2014;an authority certainly of the highest character in my estimation, I mean the member for Dublin (Mr. Grattan); I hold his authority high, because I respect, not only his talents and information, but his integrity; and I feel towards him as warmly as any resident of Ireland, the gratitude to which he is so eminently entitled, for obligations he has rendered to my country. Ministers, I perceive, are willing to ground their proceedings upon the authority of my right hon. friend. Under his great name, they would shelter the creation of enormous powers, for which there may be no necessity. At all events, wish the information I have received both from public and private sources, I must contend that no necessity appears. Why, then, should we
<image src="S1V0009P0I0625"/>
<col>1189</col>
not enquire? My object is to awaken the house to what I conceive, with deference, to be a just sense of its duty&#x2014;to procure from it a pledge that an enquiry will be instituted, and thus to hold out to the people of Ireland some prospect of redress&#x2014;some assurance of the friendly disposition of the legislature. That enquiry is necessary, no man can deny; and without full information, I must say, that it is not becoming in us to take such serious measures with regard to Ireland. We have, in fact, been legislating for that country upon hearsay authority alone, and mark, with much more of hearsay authority against, than for the course you have pursued. All this, too, while you have had the means of ample enquiry within your reach. Upon what grounds then, do you shrink from that enquiry? It is preposterous to pretend that you fly from it because you apprehend danger from discussing the affairs of that country. The fact is, that no topic requires or deserves more of your discussion or investigation. So far from avoiding knowledge upon such a subject, it is highly culpable not to seek it. I profess myself as much in want of knowledge as other persons, and I take some blame to myself on that account; but I shall endeavour by all the means in my power to obtain information, and it is with a view to remove my own defect upon this head, as well as the defects of others, that I wish for enquiry. I wish for enquiry, because it is essential, as well in respect to our own character as in justice to the people of Ireland. It is our duty to enquire upon such an occasion, and we should not shrink from that duty through any objection to the trouble that might attend it, or through any idle fear of danger; but least of all through a timid apprehension of the truth.&#x2014;With regard to the motives which have urged me to stand forward upon this occasion, I have been prompted to it by duty and by feeling. My object, to serve the cause of justice and my country, without exciting any passion or flattering any prejudice. I hope I may take credit for being as little inclined as any man to the use of inflammatory language&#x2014;as little disposed to promote sedition, or mutiny, or disaffection. For this I think I am entitled to take credit. There is not, perhaps, a man more strongly convinced than I am, that the very existence of the two islands depends upon the continuance of their connexion. I am quite assured, that if there be any party in Ireland of any de-
<col>1190</col>
nomination, which would advocate an opposite principle, that party is decidedly hostile to the interests of that country&#x2014;and should call forth the vigilance and vigour of the law. But I must say, that all appearances are against the belief of any such disaffection, much less of organized treason. Indeed, if I could imagine an observer totally free from prejudice upon the subject, his inference would, I am persuaded, be of quite an opposite tendency. If I could imagine a foreigner well disposed to Great Britain&#x2014;if I could believe such a foreigner to exist, I am satisfied he would be forward to rather congratulate Great Britain upon the present state of Ireland. There are four symptoms of loyalty and attachment to Great Britain visible in Ireland, which would naturally attract the attention of this foreigner. Having heard that the duke of Bedford was applied to by some rash individuals to proclaim a county, at the time of the insurrection of the Threshers, that noble duke rejected the application, and trusting to the ordinary operation of the law, put down the insurrection; the foreigner would, in the first instance, consider this a very good symptom of the disposition of Ireland. Well, in the second place, he would be told that there had been no disturbances whatever in that country since the duke of Bedford had put down the insurrection alluded to, and that the disposition of the people had been particularly proved by the rejection of the Catholic bill. A short description of the nature of that measure would readily satisfy his mind that the laying it aside, after it was promised, was very likely to have an irritating effect in Ireland. But instead of irritation he would witness the most perfect good order, although all the ingredients of insurrection were flung among the people, wrapped up in a proclamation for dissolving parliament. The third object of the foreigner's attention would be judge Fox's address of congratulation to the people of Tipperary, upon the peaceful state of the county; together with that judge's expression of surprise that it should be otherwise described by any person; and the fourth symptom would, more than all, satisfy his mind that no apprehension whatever could be entertained of disorders or insurrection in Ireland. For he would see the army taken away&#x2014;he would see that formidable body, the German legion, which was sent to Ireland to save it from sedition, embarked for the continent. Now, it this
<image src="S1V0009P0I0626"/>
<col>1191</col>
foreigner were to state these sentiments to the minister, and express his surprise that any suspicion could any where be entertained of the loyalty and tranquillity of the people of Ireland, what would the right hon. gentleman say to him? Perhaps the right hon. gent. would tell him that the duke of Bedford acted injudiciously in refusing to proclaim a county under martial law, and restoring the peace by means of the common law of the land&#x2014;that the circumstances of Ireland being understood for some time back, was mere matter of accident; that judge Fox knew nothing at all about the state of the country. But, would not the foreigner be apt to ask, why, it Ireland were in such a state of disaffection, should the military force be taken away from it, and two oppressive and arbitrary bills sent there, still more to irritate that disaffection? Perhaps the right hon. gent. might say, that be relied more upon these bills for preserving Ireland, than he did upon a military force; that when he marched out an army, he would march in an act of parliament; that when he withdrew a legion, he would substitute a law. But above all, what was the foreigner likely to say to the right hon. gent. when he found that, while every endeavour was using to arm the English, the Irish were disarming? With such a remarkable contrast before him, would not the foreigner&#x2014;would not any man interested for Great Britain, or possessing common sense, be disposed, particularly at a crisis when the invasion of a powerful enemy was to be apprehended, to put this plain question to the minister? If you take away the arms of the Irish, what are they to fight with? And if you take away their constitution, what are they to fight for?&#x2014;It has been said, that there exists a French party in Ireland; but when was it that such a party did not exist in that country? Since the days of Elizabeth; from the very commencement of those foul and tyrannical measures which originated in national jealousy, political prejudice, or religious dissention, but particularly the latter, which drove Catholics of high spirit from their native country, numbers of such exiles found an asylum in France, and hence a correspondence between them and their relations in Ireland, which naturally led to the creation of a French party in Ireland, and an Irish party cannot for a moment be insisted upon as a justification for the oppressive laws it was quoted
<col>1192</col>
to support. For what policy could be more mischievous and inhuman, than a perseverance in the same persecuting measures which originally created that party? Let the state of Ireland be enquired into&#x2014;let persecution and injustice be put an end to, and the French party would soon cease to exist. But, I cannot admit the danger of such a party in a political point of view. The correspondence of family connections may exist altogether independent of national attachments and prejudices, and perhaps this talked-of French party may consist solely of mere family connection, abstracted from all political views. At all events, there is no evidence upon the subject to direct the judgment of this house. There is, I must observe, a principle contained in the argument which the alleged existence of this party was adduced to support, that bears a most fearful character for Ireland indeed. For the Irish exiles having found an asylum in America, in Denmark, and other states, it would follow from the use made of this principle, that whenever Great Britain should be at war with either of these states, Ireland would be liable to have her constitution suspended, there being to be found an American and a Danish party in Ireland, as well as a French, and all arising from the same cause; which cause it is the tendency of the bills I have objected to to continue and increase.&#x2014;The cause of emigration and exile from Ireland has been considerably diminished under the auspices of our present most gracious sovereign; but still a great deal remains to be done to reconcile to their country the great body of the Irish. What has been done was no doubt calculated to do much good, but yet it is to be recollected, that there is a great deal in the manner of doing a thing. There is such a case as conferring a favour without obtaining any acknowledgment&#x2014;of rendering a service without exciting any gratitude&#x2014;and such a case may be as making concessions when it is too late. I recommend these considerations to the reflection of ministers. When they and others complain of the discontents of the Irish, they never appear to consider the cause. When they express their surprise that the Irish are not contented, while, according to their observation, that people have so much reason to be happy, they betray a total ignorance of their actual circumstances. The fact is, that the tyranny practised upon the Irish has been throughout unremitting. There has been no
<image src="S1V0009P0I0627"/>
<col>1193</col>
change but in the manner of inflicting it. They have had nothing but variety in oppression, extending to all ranks and degrees of a certain description of the people. If you would know what this varied oppression consisted in, I refer you to the penal statutes you have repealed, and to some of those which still exist. There you will see the high and the low equally subjected to the lash of persecution; and still some affect to be astonished at the discontents of the Irish! But with all my reluctance to introduce any thing ludicrous upon so serious an occasion, I cannot help referring to a little story which those very astonished persons call to my mind. It was with respect to an Irish drummer, who was employed to inflict punishment upon a soldier. While he was flogging the soldier, the poor fellow, writhing with pain, intreated him to change his mode of lashing him. Sometimes he called to him to strike a little higher, and sometimes a little lower. The drummer endeavoured to accommodate him as far as it was in his power; but finding it to no purpose, at last cried out, "Upon my conscience, you are a discontented fellow, for whether I strike high or low, there is no such thing as pleasing you." This is precisely the case with respect to Ireland. Notwithstanding the infinite variety of oppression exercised against them, there are still a number of them who are so unreasonable as to be discontented.&#x2014;As to the conduct which ought to be pursued with respect to Ireland, do not let it be imagined that I should not desire to have a strong armed force in that country. I would have such a force stationed there, much as I rely on the loyalty of the people. But this force should be the protectors and advocates of the people: it should not be placed there to act as executioners, but as a guard of honour upon the constitution, the liberty and the property of the people. I do not wish to have the fate of Ireland entrusted to an inadequate force, particularly at a period when no one can tell the hour at which the enemy may arrive. I wish to have such a force in Ireland, as well as in every other quarter of the empire, as should assure our foreign enemy of the impossibility of success; and at the same time serve to discourage the operations of domestic enemies, by convincing them that it is in vain to hope&#x2014;that his prospects and calculations were vain. With this view and object, I would have a large army in Ireland; and such an army would serve
<col>1194</col>
still more to render the bills I have referred to, quite unnecessary. Because, if invasion or rebellion should take place, the peace of the country would be vested in the army. For it is a prerogative of the crown in such cases, to put the country under martial law, and in such cases only can martial law be necessary, particularly if you keep a large force in the country. The prerogative of the crown, then, is fully competent to meet any real danger, without these bills, which are in fact nothing but martial law in masquerade.&#x2014;As to the plan of arming the people at large, which, it seems, is not to be extended to Ireland&#x2014;although the principle is so perfectly congenial with the spirit of the British constitution&#x2014;for it is a part of the king's prerogative to compel the people to arm in case of invasion or rebellion, I contend that the policy of disarming the Irish is bad, even for the purpose that measure professes to have in view. For a people that are armed are in general, or almost always, more peaceable and less discontented than those who are left defenceless and disarmed. If the king should, under his prerogative, call out the people of Ireland, or the sheriff were to summon the posse <i>comitat&#x00FB;s</i>, in what state, I would ask, are that people likely to be found after the operation of those acts of parliament? It is, however, pretended that these acts are only to continue for a certain time; that they only involve a suspension of the constitution, in which the people have a reversionary interest. But I do not know when the suspension is to cease. It began in 1795, and since then it has continued without interruption, and the lease has just been renewed for three years longer. I am of opinion that a people who can submit so long to such a measure must be tolerably well prepared for slavery. Indeed, it cannot be difficult to reconcile them to the loss of freedom. In renewing the loan to government of the Irish constitution, I remember that ministers would not attend to the advice of my right hon. friend (Mr. Grattan) as to the duration of the lease. No; where his authority suited their view, they adopted it and took shelter under it, but where that authority was against them, they rejected it. But the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer has promised that the constitution shall be restored to Ireland; I should like to see a receipt and promise of return for a free constitution, from the hand of the right hon. gent. I dare
<image src="S1V0009P0I0628"/>
<col>1195</col>
say, as he is a lawyer, a financier, and a statesman, it would be a curious production running, perhaps, in these terms&#x2014;"Where as it has been deemed expedient for the peace and good of Ireland, for good and valuable considerations, to take the constitution of that country into the keeping of the crown: I on the part of the crown do promise and declare that it shall be returned when it is deemed expedient." But suppose a project formed to withhold this constitution altogether&#x2014;suppose it were resolved to establish absolute despotism, such as would justify the resistance of a free people&#x2014;how is that resistance to be made after the arms of the people have been taken away?&#x2014;What ministers ultimately mean to do with respect to Ireland, it is really difficult to divine. They promise, to be sure, to restore the constitution, and to do many other things; but the people of Ireland know by whom the promise is made. They remember those who promised so much at the time of the Union, and never kept their word in any one point&#x2014;No, not one. Indeed, their conduct towards Ireland in this respect, puts me in mind of the promises made to children. The parent presents a favour to the view of the child: but declines to give it. No, no, the child would spoil it, and the parent keeps it for fear he should. Thus precisely are the people of Ireland trifled with as to promises; and thus are those promises fulfilled. How have they acted upon the subject of the Catholic question? I am not now going into the discussion of that question; but was not the grant of that measure held out as one of the first consequences of the Union? Such was to be collected from the words of several of the principal advocates of that measure, and, among others, even Dr. Duigenan. Mr. Pitt and the noble lord (Castlereagh) held out a hope, upon their retirement from office in 1801, that their return to office might be deemed the signal for Catholic emancipation. But yet they returned to office, and no such grant was proposed. Were not the frequent disappointments of the Catholic body&#x2014;their hopes deferred&#x2014;one of the principal causes of the Irish discontents?&#x2014;Here Mr. Sheridan entered into a review of the conduct of the several members of the present cabinet with respect to the catholic question, and contrasted those who formerly promised so much to the Catholics with those who had lately endeavoured to put an
<col>1196</col>
eternal bar to their hopes, and had raised the abominable yell of "No Popery." There were some of the latter who were, no doubt, actuated by conscientious motives. He was most sincerely disposed to do credit to the motives of his majesty, and had no doubt he was actuated by the purest dictates of conscience. In his honourable mind he was confident there existed as much abhorrence of the authors of any cry which could disunite and distract his subjects as any man in the nation could feel. He had no hesitation in saying, that those men who would raise any thing like eternal obstacles to the views of the Catholics, must act disagreeably to him whose scruples upon the subject might be removed by time and consideration. The right hon. gent. concluded this part of the subject by referring to the conduct of the last administration, whose promptitude in dropping the bill respecting the Catholics he approved, perhaps much more than he did of their original introduction of it.&#x2014;I think, said Mr. S., they began at the wrong end. They should have commenced the measure of redress in Ireland at the cottage, instead of at the park and the mansion. To have gone first to the higher orders of the Catholics&#x2014;to have sought to make them judges, and peers and commoners&#x2014;I do not know that such a proceeding, had it taken place, would not rather have served to aggravate discontent, as it might have been construed into a design to divide the interests of the Catholics. Sure I am, that with a view to serve or to conciliate the Catholic population, I mean the poor, the peasantry, its effect would be nothing; indeed it would be quite a mockery. It would be like dressing or decorating the top-masts of a ship when there were 10 feet water in the hold, or putting a laced bat on a man who had not a shoe to his foot. The place to set out with in Ireland for the relief of the people, is the cottage. The distressed state of the peasantry must be first considered, and above all, the tithes. I should hope that every man of good sense and sound heart would be forward to devote some part of his attention to this important question. A great deal of information with respect to the state of the Irish peasantry, and the best means of relieving them. may be collected from private sources. I have had many communications on the subject, and I have looked into several valuable books and pamphlets respecting the Irish peasantry, but have been particularly
<image src="S1V0009P0I0629"/>
<col>1197</col>
interested by Mr. Bell's treatise upon them. It would not require much reading after this book to make gentlemen fully acquainted with the state, habits and character of these poor peasantry, whose sufferings have so long and forcibly appealed to the humanity and justice of the legislature. I have heard it said, and I have always been shocked at the assertion, that the Irish peasantry might be comfortable if they would, if they chose to be industrious; and that it is idle to attempt any improvement of their condition. It is abominable to hear blame laid on Providence instead of laying it on man. Can any set of men, I would ask, be found who manifest so much of the qualities of which these cruel calumniators would deprive them, as the Irish peasantry? But they are only calumniated by those men who would degrade them below the level of the human creation, in order to palliate their own inhumanity towards them. We were told in England, that the unhappy Africans were insensible to the ordinary feelings of humanity, in order to render us indifferent to their sufferings, and to the custom of the slave trade. On similar motives the character of the Irish peasantry is so foully misrepresented by some men in this country and in Ireland also. But what palpable evidence do the Irish peasants, wherever you meet them, afford of the falsehood of their slanderers. Can any men exhibit more of enterprise than those peasants, in coming to this country in search of employment, or more of affection for country and family, in returning home with the pittances they earn here? Is it not manifest to every one of you, that the charge of indisposition to industry cannot apply to those poor men, who, in fact, do all the hard work of this metropolis? When, then, the Irish exhibit such a character in this country, it is impossible that such a difference at home as some gentlemen assert to exist, can proceed from any other than gross misrule. If I were proposing this enquiry in time of profound peace, I should expect your acquiescence in it. But in the difficulties which now surround the country, the claim is, in my mind, irresistible. I know it has been long the hacknied cant, that such and such is the most perilous period the country has ever known. But without any such cant&#x2014;without any exaggeration whatever, I defy any man to shew me a period in our history so full of peril; and where shall we look for aid? I
<col>1198</col>
am sick of continental alliances, of hearing about your magnanimous emperor Alexander, and all the rest of them. When, however, I look at the conduct of that sovereign, triumphing at Petersburgh upon acquisitions of territory plundered from Prussia, her ally, to whom, were he really magnanimous, he ought rather to have given territory, I cannot endure the idea of turning to the continent for any thing to confide in for our existence. When I look at France, not as Mr. Burke described it, 'a blank in the map of Europe;' but when I see nothing almost but France&#x2014;when I look to the state of the East Indies, and to that of the West also&#x2014;I find, indeed, that on Monday you pledged yourselves to enquire into the state of property in those islands, and very properly too; but when you thus pledge yourselves to enquire as to the property of the West-India planters, is it too much for me to propose a pledge that you will take into your consideration not the property of the Irish, but their allegiance, liberty, and right&#x2014;when I look at America, but in mentioning that country I should be sorry if understood at all to speak in terms ill calculated to encourage a disposition to surrender that privilege which we cannot surrender, without abandoning power arid importance&#x2014;when I have thus reviewed the state of our colonies, connections, and allies, and find the appearance so gloomy, is it unreasonable that I should ask you to look at your statute book, and to study the means of conciliating the alliance of your own subjects? While such menacing danger hangs over us, I cannot without serious pain reflect upon the manner in which you employ yourselves&#x2014;one party charging the other, and <i>vice vers</i>&#x00E2;&#x2014;"you did that job"&#x2014;"No, but you did worse,"&#x2014;"My plan raised more recruits than your's"&#x2014;"No, but it did not." As if men were recruiting for a wager, and the only object of debate was to criminate each other. I cannot patiently think of such petty squabbles, while Buonapart&#x00E9; is grasping the nations&#x2014;while he is surrounding France, not with that iron frontier, for which the wish and childish ambition of Louis the 14th was so eager, but with kingdoms of his own creation&#x2014;securing the gratitude of higher minds as the hostage, and the fears of others as pledges for his safety. His are no ordinary fortifications. His Martello towers are his allies&#x2014;crowns and sceptres are the pallisadoes of his entrench-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0630"/>
<col>1199</col>
merits, and kings are his centinels.&#x2014;In such a state of the world then, and with such an enemy, viewing this country as the almost remaining object of his ambition to destroy&#x2014;surely the policy of looking to all the means of strengthening yourselves is too obvious to require comment. Let me then exhort you to consider the means of rendering that country really serviceable to you. I have heard of subsidies. Your subsidies to Prussia were considerable in amount, and yet quite unproductive in effect. Why don't you subsidize Ireland? And all the subsidies I ask for her is your confidence, affection and justice to her people. These, I call on you to grant before it be too late. If you refuse to see the danger that menaces, and will not consider in due time about the means which I propose to you for providing against it, it is a bad symptom. The first character of courage is to look at danger with a dauntless eye, and the next to combat it with a dauntless heart. If with this resolution we front our dangers, history will do justice to our feelings and character, whatever may be the exertions or the success of the formidable tyrant who would destroy us, or of those who succeed to his power and his views. The honest historian will not fail to yield a just tribute to our reputation. If faithful to ourselves, if united, we shall in these two little islands, to which, as to an altar, freedom has flown for refuge, be able to fight with all the valorous fury of men defending a violated sanctuary.&#x2014;The right hon. gent. then concluded with moving "That this house will immediately, on the meeting of the ensuing session of parliament, proceed to take into their most serious and solemn consideration, the State and Condition of Ireland, in the anxious hope, that such measures and remedies may be safely adopted, in regard to the discontents alleged to exist in that country, as may render unnecessary the continuance of those provisions which the legislature of the united kingdom has deemed it expedient reluctantly to adopt at the close of the present session, and the permanence of which would be a violation of the rights of the people of Ireland, and a subversion of the spirit and practice of our free constitution."&#x2014;After he had read his motion, the right hon. gent. expressed his readiness to acquiesce in any amendment which should leave its main object untouched. It did
<col>1200</col>
not matter to him by whom the object was taken up. His desire was to have the thing done; and if any gentleman on any side of the house, would follow it up, he would be entitled to the gratitude of Ireland, and should have his warmest thanks.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, it did not seem to him to be necessary to enter into any argument on the subjects touched on by the right hon. gent. He begged leave, however, before he even troubled the house with the few words which he should have to offer on the subject of the right hon. gent's. motion, to correct a mistake into which he had fallen. The right hon. gent. had said, that the military defence of Ireland had been greatly reduced within a short period by the removal of troops from that country. Any reduction of this kind, however, which had taken place, was trifling in the extreme; and when he mentioned that there were at this moment in Ireland 50,000 men of the regular army and militia alone, independent of volunteers, gentlemen, he was convinced, would agree with him, that the military force in that part of the country had not been reduced in any improper degree. Having rectified this mistake in the statement of the right hon. gent., he should now offer a few words on the grounds upon which he called on the house to concur in the present motion. Great part of what had fallen from the right hon. gent. on this head seemed to him not so much applicable to the right hon. gent.'s present purpose, as to two bills lately before the house, and on which, as it would seem, the right hon. gent., having omitted, or not having seen, a favourable opportunity of delivering his sentiments, wished still to avail himself of that privilege. The harangue of the right hon. gent. taking it in this point of view, so far from being calculated to produce unanimity, could alone tend to discontent and division. When the right hon. gent. stated, that the renewal of the bills alluded to for a series of years was only to prepare the people for a total extinction of their liberties, was that not calculated to irritate rather than to reconcile? The measures, too, to which the right hon gent. alluded, had only lately passed through that house, and had been regarded universally as acts of imperious necessity. It was, therefore, rather an extravagant expectation in the right hon. gent. that having so recently declared the measures necessary, the house should now, with the circumstance fresh in their recol-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0631"/>
<col>1201</col>
lection, contradict what they had so lately enacted. The house had lately discharged an important duty to the people on this and on the other side of the water: it was extravagant in the right hon. gent. to hope that they should so soon falsify what they had done. That the house would be ready at all times to consider every thing that could be done for the good of Ireland, there could be no doubt; and this being the case, there could be no necessity for entering into a pledge to that effect. It was only for the right hon. gent. at any time, to bring forward any measure which in his judgement might be for the good of the united kingdom in general, and Ireland in particular, and he should be ready to give it every support in his power. He denied that the right hon. gent. was correct in saying, that ever since the union the interests of Ireland had been treated with indifference. He knew that the house would be eager at all times to shew every attention to the state of that part of the country without the necessity of any pledge on the subject. He should therefore forbear from introducing any unprofitable discussion on the present occasion, but should content himself with moving the previous question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Grattan</member> <membercontribution>began by observing that he was glad that the present question had excited so great a portion of the public attention, because it she wed that the people of this country were not indifferent to the common cause. Ireland was linked to that cause, and every thing which related to Ireland naturally excited the public interest. It was the cause, not of Ireland only, but of the two islands together; the greatness, that is, the being of this great empire, was identified with the cordial co-operation of Ireland, and every question that related to the one, naturally involved the dearest interests of the other. With regard to the term of the Insurrection bill, he had certainly voted for the shorter period, and he still believed that it would have been more wise to confine within as narrow limits as possible, the period of the suspension of the British constitution. This much he said in confirmation of the assertion of his right hon. friend (Mr. Sheridan), who had, on that night, re-asserted his claim to the due applause of past times, and the disinterested admiration of impartial posterity. He had fought a good fight in the cause of Ireland; he had evinced a statesman's firmness and a patriot's love, and his display in the cause of
<col>1202</col>
his native country, was not the less luminous, because a commendable moderation served to augment its splendour and invigorate its force. He (Mr. Grattan) approved of that moderation, and approved of the sentiment&#x2014;it was not in the sentiment he differed from his right hon. friend&#x2014;no, far from it; he heartily coincided with him in the sentiment; it was in the application of that sentiment that he had the misfortune to differ from him. In the first place, he could not agree with his right hon. friend, that there were no just grounds for the passing of the two bills, the Irish Arms bill, and the Irish Insurrection bill, which had been enacted by parliament. His right hon. friend had said, that there was no just ground for passing the Insurrection bill, and yet had not his right hon. friend admitted that there was a French party in Ireland? He did more, he said that there had been ever a French party in Ireland. He allowed the justice of that statement; but he begged the house, and his right hon. friend, to recollect, that there was a very great difference between a party that had existed, and a party that now existed, and not only that, but there was also a great difference in the times, and now that France was become such a gigantic power, and a French party existed in Ireland, that was alone, in his opinion, a good reason for adopting a strong measure. There might be times when the common law of the land was by no means sufficient for the safety and security of the country; and when that was the case, strong measures must be resorted to. He did not mean to say that the people of Ireland were in general disaffected; on the contrary, he joined with his right hon. friend in the belief that they were generally loyal and firmly attached to the government of this country. It was not, however, sufficient to say that particular counties were undisturbed. Mr. justice Fox, he had no doubt, was very right in what he had said of the counties of Tipperary, Wexford, and Kilkenny, but there might be discontented parties in other quarters, which were sufficient to justify the extraordinary powers given by the bills lately passed. His right hon. friend had stated that the people of Ireland were in a state of perfect tranquillity, and that a person of the highest authority, in another place, had given it as his opinion that the Arms bill was unnecessary. That high authority might think so, but he could not agree with him on that head. The great
<image src="S1V0009P0I0632"/>
<col>1203</col>
object of the Arms bill seemed not to be fully understood; it had in view the disarming, not the great mass of the people, but certain portions of them who were rebels, and who went about the country to the houses of farmers, and gentlemen who were known to have arms, and plundered them of the same, to use them for rebellious purposes, and one of the chief objects of the bill was to take from those robbers the power of doing that. Another object of the act was to prevent compulsory oaths from being administered, and other matters which tended to promote and diffuse insurrection. Was it oppression to check such a banditti in their career&#x2014;the career that must finally arm them against all law and social order? He did not think it was, and he therefore voted for the enaction of the Irish Arms bill. But, it had been his crime too, to vote for the Insurrection act. He had done so, and he did not think he ever should have cause to regret that vote. It did go to suspend the constitution, but its operation was confined to a state of rebellion only; that is, an aweful emergency alone was to render its application necessary. The remedy was violent&#x2014;granted&#x2014;but the evil was deadly. The trial by jury, however, was not even in rebellion to be abolished, and the <i>judicium parium</i> was justly considered equivalent to any such emergency; with all this he was ready to admit that the remedy was unconstitutional. But at the same time he felt that it was necessary. It was no new or sudden remedy; the first insurrection act had originated with the late lord Kilwarden, chief judge of the king's bench in Ireland. He had drawn it up, and that person was no enemy to the established laws of his country, for at his death he had announced his wish that his murderers should be brought to justice by the law of the land only, and not by any extraordinary means of intervention. A still greater authority had supported the principle of the bill, the late lord Yelverton, viscount Avenmore, then the chief baron of the exchequer. That great constitutional lawyer had approved of the principle of this bill upon the ground of its urgent necessity. He spoke in the Irish house of lords in favour of the principle in 1796, in 1797 he supported the principle, and in 1798 proved that he was not wrong in supporting it. But, as to men yet living, they were not without authority: the late attorney-general for Ireland was known enough even in that house to be there the authority he was
<col>1204</col>
so justly in his own country; he had approved of the principle; the solicitor general for Ireland had approved of the principle of the bill&#x2014;a man, perhaps, of the first genius in that country, and of a spirit of patriotism liberal and enlightened as his talents. The present bill had been supported by them both; and was it so culpable in him (Mr. Grattan) to yield to his own impulse when sanctioned by such great constitutional authority? The bill he believed to be necessary, and so rooted was his conviction, that he should have supported that bill had he been left in a trifling minority&#x2014;nay, continued Mr. Grattan, had I stood alone I should have voted for both bills&#x2014;the state of Ireland justified them. I am not speaking against Ireland, but I am advocating the cause of Ireland against France. I would put Ireland herself against the distempers that would sap her constitution&#x2014;it is a strong constitution&#x2014;nature has done much, but something may creep in to abuse the bounty of nature&#x2014;at the same time they are not to be looked upon as symptoms of weakness&#x2014;the bodily habit is physically strong, and the eruptions on the surface prove rather a certain kind of inane violence, that may be purified into salutary strength;&#x2014;correct the external pruriency, and you have all the advantages of inward health and substantial vigour&#x2014;the pimple on the face of the fair one does not dim the lustre of her beauty or contract the fascination of her charms. In the same manner, if Ireland had expressed any indignant sense of measures that were deemed oppressive, the feeling that was strong in resentment for alledged sufferings, would be lively in gratitude for projected benefits. Ireland might murmur for what she had suffered, but would be grateful for what she was but promised. So much for Ireland. With respect to those two laws, they are enacted not against Ireland, but for the empire. If the suspension of the constitution is objected to, I answer that the Mutiny bill is a suspension of the constitution in England; of the dearest privileges of the Bill of Rights; yet, why was it enacted? That we might have an army&#x2014;a standing army&#x2014;in England, and why are those bills, the Irish Arms and Irish Insurrection bills, enacted?&#x2014;why, that the French may not have an army in Ireland. It is good to talk of abstract principles; but it is better to apply such principles to existing difficulties. I would therefore suspend the English constitution in Ireland, that Ireland may have
<image src="S1V0009P0I0633"/>
<col>1205</col>
it and maintain it ever after. I like abstract principles most where they can be best applied; those wide, vague, cosmopolitan principles were useless if they did not apply, and perhaps were dangerous if they did. So much for the bills which I have supported; and now as to the general state of Ireland I would say a few words. If you would remedy Ireland, look to it in three points of view: look to it in its education, its agriculture, and its religion. The system of education is bad; it is, as far as relates to the free schools, a monopoly&#x2014;the number of petty schools are injurious to the cause of literature. I would go not only to educate the rich but the poor. Eight thousand acres of land support but 18 free schools, averaging the 8000 acres at 10,000 pounds&#x2014;those free schools have not succeeded; I am not prepared to say why. Many of the principals I know to be men of capability, assiduity, and learning; but yet the schools have declined. Perhaps it is owing to the niggardly policy that defeats its own object in the manner of the institution. The petty schools are too many, and the great ones too few. The result of such an economy may be readily anticipated. Two or three great public schools would be better than a horde of these minor inefficient schools. When you plant a little school in a wide extent, and yet a limited vicinity, you ingraft imbecility upon ignorance: it perishes by its own weakness. Whereas, colonize learning, and you assist its propagation. I would recommend, therefore, a principal school in each parish. As to the second consideration&#x2014;the agriculture; it involved at once the question of tithes: tithes made the hot-bed of discontent in Ireland. I would propose some modification with respect to the mode of collecting them. Let the government, suppose, guarantee the payment to the clergy, and thus exonerate the struggling peasant from the many restrictions that at present hang over him, as to the culture or management of the little spot that gives him an interest in the fate of Ireland, by enabling him to feed his wife and family; this subject is peculiarly worthy the attention of parliament, because tithes have been the source of all past disturbances in Ireland. Tithes gave rise to the "Hearts of Steel." Tithes called together the "Right Boys." Tithes were the cause of the "White Boys." Tithes were the cause of the "Peep of day Boys." Tithes were the cause of "Threshers." Tithes were in a manner a
<col>1206</col>
kind of watch-word to summon the oppressed to act in common cause against their oppression. I would propose, then, a commutation of Tithe. This subject deserves the most serious attention, for if you remove this one cause of discontent, it will go in a great degree to fritter away the rest.&#x2014;The third head is religion: upon this I shall be very brief, because it is too obvious to receive any elucidation from what I could offer here. I most heartily concur with my right hon. friend&#x2014;the door is shut, and the population of Ireland is excluded&#x2014;and excluded from what? from the means of defending you&#x2014;from the generous spirit to defend what they have not, and the disinterested zeal of co-operating with you in defence of what you have and enjoy, and that too immediately by them; to whom you refuse the same blessings. The parliament have no right to refuse their religion to a people that obey faithfully and fight ardently in behalf of the laws that it enacts. No one set of men can justly dictate to another the creed of their own orthodoxy&#x2014;no government has a right to obtrude into the sanctuary of the human mind, to decide between its God and its responsibility. But it has been said, that the faith of the Catholics of Ireland related to foreign powers and engendered foreign affections. It is denied by the Catholics in their professions and conduct. The leading sentiment among them is hostility to France and French principles. I will read the resolutions of the Protestant Grand Jurors of the county of Kilkenny&#x2014;I will read also the answer of their Catholic brethren [here the right hon. gent. read the resolutions]. Is it, then, to be endured, that such men could in general be suspected of harbouring a thought favourable to French politicians? Let England look at her strength, and ask herself how much she owes of it to Ireland. The Catholics have gone hand in hand cheerfully with you in all dangers; will you now turn your back on them, and deny them a share of your privileges? If you object to them pigmy scruples of bigotry and party, how will you answer to their mighty appeal to the battles they have fought, and the victories they have shared in? It is a bad policy to tell the men covered with wounds in defence of your rights, that they shall have no rights to plead for; but my hopes are founded on something sounder than your provisions. If the people of Ireland see their situation with a mind truly great&#x2014;if, as formerly,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0634"/>
<col>1207</col>
their strength of mind be but proportionate to the extent of their calamity&#x2014;if with a dignified compassion they pity and forgive the pitiable virulence of party animosity&#x2014;if they forget every thing but themselves and what they have been, and what they have done; in 1779, when they got a trade, and in the memorable 1782, when they got a constitution&#x2014;if Ireland but remembers this, and looks to the present momentous crisis with the eye of a gallant general, and a high-minded nation, then will she best refute the calumnies of ignorance; she will not turn aside from the cause of Great Britain, of Europe, and the globe, to listen to the moody mutterings of any shabby mutineer&#x2014;the night-boy, or the white-boy, or any other ragged rebel. She will look to what such a policy did for her in 1779; she will see constitution following commerce in 1782; she will ponder upon them and not disgrace the example of those hallowed times. French politics are their own remedy. Ireland need not look to Holland, where commerce invited plunder, but could not glut it. Ireland need not look to Genoa, where prostration was the consequence of an ill-placed and hasty confidence. She need not look to Italy, where all that was made sacred by time, by habit, by national prejudice, by religion, served only by the richness of the spoils, to heighten the splendour of the conflagration that consumed them. Let her remember that she has qualified herself in pursuit of the rights she has obtained, by the freedom that sought, and the allegiance that acknowledge them. Ireland has fought boldly and faithfully to secure to England the constitution Ireland so naturally wishes to share the blessings of; but she will continue in the pursuit of them, as she has done in the pursuit of a legitimate object&#x2014;by legitimate means. Let it be for you to answer her accordingly, and let no narrow policy prevent you from making the Irish Protestants a people, by making the Irish Catholics free men. Such are my sentiments as to the state of Ireland; agreeing, as I do, with the sentiments of my right hon. friend, whose exertions this night in the cause of his native country, are above my poor praise, and do equal honour to his talents and to his patriotism; still I differ from him in the application of that sentiment. Besides, the motion in its present form goes to censure the late proceedings of parliament, with respect to that country; and I do not think that the house would readily
<col>1208</col>
acquiesce in imposing a censure upon itself. I am willing to give every credit to the motives of my right hon. friend in making the present motion, but it is not to be expected that I am now to censure my own act in voting for the two bills, which the present state of Ireland, and that of Europe, as affecting Ireland, in my mind rendered necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Dillon</member> <membercontribution>declared, that the adoption of the proposition before the house, must be considered as a solemn pledge of a new system of policy to be pursued with regard to the government of Ireland. It was a question of two modes of governing a country, which was admitted to be in a perpetual state of radical discontent. With regard to the government of such a country, two modes only could be resorted to&#x2014;the one which he should recommend, namely, by removing the causes of such alleged discontent; the other, by adopting such vigorous and restrictive measures as those lately adopted, the effect of which was to guard against the ill effects of the bad system of policy pursued&#x2014;a system which would consecrate abuse and reign only by arbitrary power. As to the effects of such a system, he must be allowed to state an axiom which had been agreed upon at all times, and by all the eminent persons who had ever written or spoken upon political economy&#x2014;this axiom was, that a state would sooner recover from the effects of war, and conflagration, and general devastation, provided the period which should ensue should be one in which such a state should have full advantages of excellent laws and excellent government&#x2014;than a state which had not been afflicted by such calamities, but had habitually groaned under bad government, restrictive laws, or commercial and civil liberty, during a period of unprofitable monotonous peace. To illustrate this axiom, he had only to look to the history of Ireland during the period of the two last centuries and he was constrained to give the preference to the former century, although disturbed and afflicted by frequent wars, over the last century, although a period of profound peace. Here he took a view of the state of Ireland from queen Elizabeth's reign to the year 1698, when the woollen trade was destroyed, and the articles of Limerick infringed, proving how much Ireland had comparatively flourished when laws had been passed in favour of commercial and civil liberty, though in a most disturbed pe-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0635"/>
<col>1209</col>
riod: and how low she had been since, owing to such restrictive laws, up to 1799, when she recovered her trade. He earnestly recommended the people of Ireland always to look to the period of the glorious &#x00E6;ra of 1782, and not to the disgraceful one of 1798; in the one they obtained their liberties&#x2014;in the other they lost them; that they should follow Mr. Grattan's advice, and pursue legitimate objects by legitimate means.&#x2014;With regard to that intolerable grievance, the present tithing system, he anticipated objections on the part of the chancellor of the exchequer, on the score of danger to the church, by meddling with church property. But this had been done already by lord Castlereagh, who had brought in a bill at the time of passing the act of Union, exempting pasture lands from the payment of tithe of agistment, as it was called&#x2014;a most invidious and oppressive exemption.&#x2014;It was impossible to argue more at length, when the gentlemen opposite would not condescend to notice any observations from his side of the house&#x2014;there was nothing for him to refute. He concluded by giving his warm support to Mr Sheridan's motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Windham</member> <membercontribution>thought the disturbances in Ireland were to be imputed solely to an ill-judged system of misrule in that country. The Irish had been long asking, not so much for the rights of the constitution, as the rights of nature. As to a French party in Ireland, he not only believed that there was a French party, but that there ever had been a French party there, and, was it wise to give that party strength by the refusal of concessions, to which the population of Ireland had so just a claim? At the same time, he did not mean in the least degree to call in question the propriety of the late two bills&#x2014;the Insurrection and the Arms bills. It had been satisfactorily proved to every individual in that house, that there was an existing necessity in Ireland for the enactment of those measures, on the great and incontrovertible authority of his right hon. friend upon his left hand (Mr. Grattan). He had stated, that there was a French party in Ireland, and that those measures were necessary; if his right hon. friend had not information to be relied on with respect to Ireland, he (Mr. Windham) did not know who had; and if the same character had not an interest in every thing connected with that country, he was really at a loss to find out who had. He disapproved, too, of the
<col>1210</col>
manner in which his right hon. friend upon his right (Mr. Sheridan) had thrown out his objections with respect to the state of Ireland. In exciting Ireland to discontent, he was afraid it was spurring a willing horse, though he did not wish at the same time to have it understood, that he thought the conciliatory effort of his right hon. friend in making the motion he had submitted to the house, like the sly horseman; who,
<quote>While his off-heel, insidiously aside,</quote>
<quote>Provokes the caper which he seems to chide,</quote>
he did not mean to insinuate that; but he should certainly be very cautious how far he would hold out to a people promises of relief, when there were no means of relief in his power. The attempt of the late ministers had been defeated, and in a manner that left no room for hope. It was one thing to talk of relief to the great mass of a population, but it was a different thing to administer it. He acceded most cordially to the principle, that that house should not lose sight of Ireland. It was the out-post, and an out-post that endangered in its loss the safety of the place itself. He was convinced that their union was essential to the very existence of Great Britain. Ireland was the most vulnerable, and at the same time the most mortal part of the empire. He did not much like tampering with her. It was like the abrupt removal of bandages: the bad handling of the bandages might do a great deal of unintentional mischief by giving rise to a considerable portion of irritation. As to the specific object of the motion now before the house, he did not know well how to refuse his assent to it: he should hope that the pledge was unnecessary, but nevertheless, when required of him, he did not think he could consistently refuse it. He was willing to pledge himself along with the house, that the state of Ireland should have their early and most grave consideration; for he felt that such a pledge was due to the discontents existing in that ill-treated country. He earnestly hoped that the house would, in the present instance, have no objection to pledge itself to do what was acknowledged upon all sides to be its duty, and a duty of the first magnitude.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord William Russell</member> <membercontribution>felt peculiar regret at being obliged to differ, in the slightest degree, from his right honourable friends, as he hoped his sincere admiration for the talents and character of both would allow
<image src="S1V0009P0I0636"/>
<col>1211</col>
him the privilege of calling them, (messrs. Grattan and Windham); but he could not forbear expressing his dissent from some of the points they had respectively urged, in justification of the two bills which had lately passed that house, the grounds of which, it was the object of his honourable friend's motion to bring under the future revision of parliament: he felt indeed more imperiously bound to attempt some explanation of his sentiments, as one honourable gentleman (Mr. Grattan) had rested a main part of his argument on the circumstance of the persons who composed the late administration of Ireland having adopted a similar measure.&#x2014;For that government, in all its parts, it would be easily believed, no person could possibly entertain a higher respect than himself; to the noble duke who had been at the head of it he was bound by every tie that could attach man to man, not only by the nearest consanguinity and the most affectionate intimacy, which had subsisted between them from their earliest infancy, but also from a perfect reciprocity of opinion on all political topics; the authority of that noble person was with him all but omnipotent: he had likewise so favourable a judgment of all those who were associated with his noble relation in the administration of his government., that, had they continued in office, he should have consented, by his vote, to the provisions lately enacted without hesitation, though certainly not without deep regret; giving full credit to their representation of the necessity, and entertaining an implicit reliance on their discretion and forbearance in the exercise of the extraordinary powers entrusted to their hands: but the confidence he should have reposed in them, he could not extend to their successors.&#x2014;It had been the grand principle of the government over which his noble relation had presided, to conciliate all the differences, to allay the jealousies and animosities that had so long distracted that unhappy country; to restore the blessing of harmony, to unite all description of man, and, above all, to establish that most important desideratum, a mutual confidence between the people and their magistrates and rulers.&#x2014;He challenged single instance in which they had departed from that wise and beneficent plan.&#x2014;Of the noble duke (Richmond) who had been appointed to succeed him, he did not wish to insinuate any thing the leas disrespectful; he knew him to be possess-
<col>1212</col>
ed of many great and excellent qualities, and of his merit in any respect he did not entertain the smallest doubt:&#x2014;but that noble duke was now officially connected with a party in this country, whose system of policy he more than doubted; he was convinced it was fundamentally bad; the duke of Bedford's moderation had been condemned in that house, by persons now high in the administration of this country, who had deprecated the effects of what they termed his mistaken lenity.&#x2014;What had resulted from the opposite course which had been pursued with little intermission for centuries?&#x2014;The necessity of the late bills!&#x2014;And was it really thought possible that the same treatment which had occasioned the disease should afterwards operate as its cure?&#x2014;It would be an unwarrantable trespass on the indulgence of the house to go into a detailed examination of the plan on which Ireland had been governed ever since her conquest under Henry the Second, and deduce a regular train of consequences from a perseverance in the same line of conduct towards her, during a period of 600 years; though such an investigation would undoubtedly open a field of reflection from which many very useful lessons might be drawn: we had throughout treated her only as a conquered country, we had never appeared even to suppose the possibility of her interests being identified with ours; instead of nourishing her strength, as an addition to our own resources with the fostering care of an anxious parent towards a child; we had exacted her services as a task-master from a slave, and consequently, both nations had viewed each other with the natural distrust of persons standing in so odious a relation.&#x2014;It was necessary, however, and sufficient for the present purpose, particularly to draw the attention of the house to the history of the last eleven years, during which the present laws had existed; they were first adopted, he believed, for 4 years;&#x2014;did they in that time remedy the grievance?&#x2014;No&#x2014;they were then renewed for seven, still the condition of the country remained the same; and we had now been called on to continue them for three more.&#x2014;We had had sufficient time to judge of the merit of the tree by the fruit it had produced, and surely it was now time to abandon a project that had so indisputably failed. Were we to content ourselves with ringing the changes on the number of years for which such measures were to be passed, and set with our
<image src="S1V0009P0I0637"/>
<col>1209*</col>
hands before us in these times of danger, patiently waiting to see different effects, flow from the same causes? He feared those who encouraged such hopes would be lamentably disappointed:
<quote>"Rusticus expect at dum defluet amnis; at ille Labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis &#x00B6;vum."</quote>
Nothing short of a revolution in the whole moral world could bring about such a state of things, as to produce security from a long continuance of rigour and restriction; as long as the human mind remained as it was, so long would force alienate love, and oppression engender faction, tumult, and rebellion. His right honourable friend (Mr. Grattan) had dwelt with much force on the actual existence of a French party in Ireland; on such high authority he did not question the fact; and he thought the cause of its existence might be traced in the uniform neglect of that liberal counsel, which the honourable gentleman had himself suggested through an honourable and long political life. The honourable gentleman had drawn with his wonted energy of expression, a just and horrid picture of that misery, that had invariably fallen from French alliance, on the unfortunate countries who had been in their turns her victims or dupes. But, much as he admired the brilliancy of his eloquence, highly as he admired the principle from which it sprung, strongly as he felt the justice of its application; still he would take the liberty of saying, that it was at present almost unnecessary; since the fate of Holland, of Genoa, and of Italy, were so notorious and apparent, that even in the least informed classes of society there were few who were not in some measure acquainted with the atrocities that attended them: yet in spite of all this, in the face of such examples, it was said there still existed a French party in Ireland! Gracious God! was it possible to imagine more irresistible argument for a grave, impartial, and thorough investigation into the whole state of that country, than a fact so monstrous, as that, in defiance of these terrible warnings, there were yet men so disaffected, so impatient of British dominion, as even to prefer to it the destructive aid and poisonous embrace of our implacable enemy, and this too among a people as brave, as generous, and naturally as affectionate as any race under heaven.&#x2014;In the course of the debate, a great deal had been said of the concessions made to Ireland during his present ma-
<col>1210*</col>
jesty's reign; but he confessed, he wished the value of them was more apparent to him, or rather that he could think they were so considered by those on whom they had been bestowed. In the year 1782, he had indeed granted them, in the repeal of Poyning's law, the important boon of an independent legislature, but then he thought it could not be denied that, subsequently by the union, that valuable privilege had in fact been virtually cancelled; for it was obvious that in the united parliament, British councils, and British interest must predominate, and therefore he feared Irish objects were only to be attained by the adherence of her representatives to the ministerial side of the house. To that union, however, much as he had objected to it, he was, now that it was established, as desirous as any one of giving permanence and stability, but he was afraid it was the general impression in Ireland, that it had been obtained under false pretences. As the price of her consent, Ireland had been promised all the blessings in spirit as well as form of the British constitution, the Catholics of Ireland had been promised a free participation in all the rights and benefits enjoyed by their fellow subjects; and the name of a great departed minister had been pledged for the performance, but the pledge remained unredeemed. He saw on the opposite bench a noble lord (Castlereagh) who had been principally instrumental in carrying that measure into effect; but he did not see a right hon. gent. now high in the administration of the affairs of Ireland (Mr. Foster), or he would have wished to address himself to him. He remembered to have heard that hon. gent. charge the noble lord, directly, and to his face, with having carried the union by the means of corruption, and an undue exercise of arbitrary power.&#x2014;They were now closely allied, and both holding high situations in the administration of the country: What were the Irish to feel when they saw nothing proceed from such a junction but renewed restrictions on them? when they received no attention from government, but for the purpose of coercion? He concluded by repeating, that, as he should readily have voted for the "Arms and Insurrection bills," had they been only as means of defence in prosecuting a system of a different nature, yet he had not been able to approve of them as a material part of the system itself&#x2014;though
<image src="S1V0009P0I0638"/>
<col>1211*</col>
he could have granted them as auxiliaries, he could not as principals, but as they were now passed, he thought all that remained was, if possible, to obtain some pledge, that parliament would resume that enquiry into the state of Ireland which the late government had set on foot; he thought the motion of his right hon. friend was well adapted for this purpose, and he was happy to find that he should concur in the vote with many of those friends, with whom, in a former instance, it had been so painful to him to disagree.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Lockhart</member> <membercontribution>was surprized at the indiscretion of the right hon. mover; for to represent Ireland as treated worse than a conquered country, and as having neither arms to fight with, nor any thing to fight for, and as oppressed or neglected by the legislature, contrary to the fact, tended to irritate that country, and to promote disunion between the united kingdoms. He was also surprized, that the right hon. gent. should represent the acts of a legislature, that was distinguished by cosmopolitan beneficence, as the evil of which Ireland had to complain. So far from being a suspension of the constitution, these acts were but the exercise of it. To call forth the powers given by the constitution for the protection of the peaceable and loyal subjects, was but to put the constitution in force. He was happy that the example of the right hon. gent. had not been followed by the other right hon. gent. who spoke from the same bench, and had pointed out certain measures for the relief of Ireland. As to the measure respecting education, he entirely agreed with that right hon. gent.; and as to a composition for tithes, if that should be necessary, he would not oppose it, provided that composition were to be progressive with the times, and as well secured as tithes were in this country to the clergy. As to the question of emancipation, his difficulty was, that the principles of the religion would, in the event of the Catholics getting power, be dangerous to the Protestant ascendancy. He thought that all governments, from which concessions or boons were demanded, should secure a due obedience to the laws before granting them, lest they should be received as proceeding from weakness, and not from wisdom and benevolence, and thus excite contempt instead of gratitude. He should vote against the motion, because it implied a dereliction of duty on their parts, and a censure upon acts of the legislature, the ne-

As to the question of emancipation, his difficulty was, that the principles of the religion would, in the event of the Catholics getting power, be dangerous to the Protestant ascendancy. He thought that all governments, from which concessions or boons were demanded, should secure a due obedience to the laws before granting them, lest they should be received as proceeding from weakness, and not from wisdom and benevolence, and thus excite contempt instead of gratitude. He should vote against the motion, because it implied a dereliction of duty on their parts, and a censure upon acts of the legislature, the necessity for which had been admitted on all sides.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>Mr. Sheridan</member> <membercontribution>rose amidst cries of "question," and expressed his hope that the house would indulge him with the privilege usually granted to persons who brought forward a motion, and hear his reply to such arguments as seemed to him peculiarly to call for attention. Of this privilege he would not avail himself at any length. First, then, he should have no objection whatever to alter his motion in the manner proposed; and, indeed, to any alteration that did not destroy the substance of his motion, he had already pledged himself to agree&#x2014;[The Speaker here interrupted the right hon. gent. and informed him, that consistently with the resolution of 1778, and the usages of the house, there could be no alteration in the motion after the previous question had been put].&#x2014;Mr. Sheridan, in continuation observed, that in that case he had no doubt the right hon. gent. opposite would withdraw his motion, in compliance with the general wish of the house. He wished to have his answer. [No answer.] Well, the time for answering was not yet come perhaps. However, nothing in the world had been more misunderstood in this respect than the motion which he had submitted. Gentlemen seemed to suppose that he had censured the passing of the late bills, and thereby called upon the house to censure its own acts. He never had such intention, nor could his motion by any one who took the trouble to attend to it, be supposed to carry any such meaning. He had distinctly declared in his speech, that he had no such intention. But, it might be said, that though not in his speech, it might be in his motion. What, then, was his motion?&#x2014;"That the house should take such measures as would render the provisions of the bills, lately with reluctance passed, unnecessary." What did his right hon. friend and his hon. friend over the way (Mr. Herbert) object to? They could not surely object to the word "reluctantly." His hon. friend over the way said, that he would join with him if he would strike out the latter part of his motion. What was that? Why, that the permanency of such measures would totally destroy the constitution. Did any one object to this? Then, he would be glad to see the man who would stand up in his place, and say that such enactments ought to be permanent, or that, if permanent, they did not completely overturn the constitution. These acts were to be in force for 3 years; and under these circumstances there was at least a reversion
<col>1214</col>
of the constitution. But, if you thought that the permanency of such acts did not infringe the constitution, then you ought to make them permanent at once, for in that case where was the use of hesitation? Such enactments could not be considered in any other light, than as infringements of the constitution; and therefore it was the duty of every man to limit their duration, as much as the necessity of the case would allow.&#x2014;He felt it necessary to make some observations on what had fallen from the hon. gent. on the bench below him. With all the respect he had for that hon. gent.'s (Mr. Lockhart's) abilities; with all his deference to his means of information, and to the authority which he appeared to have with some, yet, not being intimately acquainted with the hon. gent., and not having an opportunity of observing those talents and information that had been ascribed to him by those who knew him better, he was perfectly excusable in not giving him that entire confidence that had been given by others. That hon. gent. had said, that he had listened with great anxiety to his speech, because he expected that he (Mr. S.) would have first stated the evil, and then the remedy. The hon. gent. might have listened to his speech with anxiety, but he had certainly done so with more anxiety than attention. He said, that he (Mr. S.) ought to have pointed out the grievance. Certainly not. He never thought that he was bound specifically to do that in the present instance. When ministers came to him, asking him to give his assent to such regulations as these, the <i>onus probandi</i> lay with them. They were to shew what grievances called for such measures and that, too, before the measures were passed. "But no," said the hon. gent., "pass your bills first, and then let us hear of grievances." Enquiry ought to have preceded the passing of these enactments, and the necessity for them ought to have been proved. However, the house had passed the bills, and all he wanted now was, that they should give a pledge to enquire whether they had passed them on good grounds or not. This was all he asked. His object was to keep this subject perpetually before the house. If the bills had been enacted only for a year, there would have been less cause for his motion. But as the period of their duration extended to three years, his object was, and he hoped the result of an en-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0640"/>
<col>1215</col>
quiry would prove it unnecessary, to continue them for more than one year. This, he was, for his own part, persuaded, would turn out to be the case, unless gentlemen chose to continue in ignorance, and rejected the means of acquiring information. But the hon. gent. dwelt a good deal upon general doctrine, and said that a boon ought not to be granted till you were strong, and had enabled yourselves to crush your petitioners if you chose! He (Mr. S.) had really thought that men could distinguish between good and bad treatment, and that the one produced gratitude and attachment, as naturally as the other did revenge and hatred! "But no," said the hon. gent., "make them fear you first, that they may love you afterwards!" Then the hon. gent. accused him of having said that Ireland had been used worse than a conquered country. Certainly, he had said that England had adopted a more ignorant and barbarous system of management with respect to Ireland, than ever any one nation with any pretensions to civilization had adopted with respect to another. The hon. gent. said, that he was taken a-back with regard to this statement, when he allowed that concessions had been made in the present reign, and consequently the system charged. This, he supposed, was meant, for he did not pretend to understand the phrase "taken a-back," not being a naval man, as the hon. gent. probably was. That the concessions had been made with a very ill grace, he had certainly said. He did not wish, as he had said before, to produce any irritation whatever; but it the times and circumstances when these concessions were made were considered, it would be found that they had rather been wrung from most unwilling minds, than conferred in an open, liberal, and generous manner. He (Mr. S.) deprecated waiting for such times and circumstances. He was for conferring favours when they might be ascribed to a sense of generosity and justice, and not for waiting till they could be demanded, when you would not dare to refuse them. Now, his right hon. friend on the bench near him, (Mr. Grattan,) had made a more able speech in favour of his motion than he himself could possibly do. That speech was characteristic of his wonted genius and eloquence, and every thing must be full of genius, animation, and eloquence, that came from him. This very speech Was one great instance of the benefits to be
<col>1216</col>
derived from the motion now submitted to the house; for his right hon. friend had in the course of it thrown out more information respecting the state of Ireland than ever had been communicated by any other member, or at any period for some time past.&#x2014;But, another member accused him of libelling the legislation of this country, and our cosmopolitan and philanthropic parliament! But what had our most philanthropic parliament done for Ireland? Why, they had legislated without enquiry for that country; but, if his motion had been proposed and agreed to, 2 or 3 years ago, parliament would have been better able to have legislated for Ireland. For the proof of this he would only refer to the speech of his right hon. friend, who had exposed the abuses with respect to tithes, the non-residence of the clergy, and the state of the Protestant schools. The hon. gent. seemed to be mightily offended at his saying that government had not been attentive to Ireland. For a proof of this, too, he referred to the speech of his right hon. friend (Mr. Grattan), who had stated that 8000 acres of land only supported 18 Protestant schools; and yet, with all this before them, some gentlemen pretended that government had paid the requisite attention to the state of Ireland! He hoped, however, that an attention of a different sort would be given it. Ireland expected this; England expected it; and the result, he had no doubt, would be beneficial to both countries&#x2014;His right hon. friend bad a<ob/>verted to the state of tithes in Ireland, and <ob/> the ill-constructed method of collecting and managing them, had deduced a great part of the evils under which Ireland laboured. The "Hearts of Steel"&#x2014;the "White Boys"&#x2014;the "Bright Boys"&#x2014;and the "Threshers," all arose from the tithes which appeared the most cruel of the burthens under which the lower ranks of people in Ireland groaned. Why, then, did not this sufficiently account for the disaffection in Ireland, without having recourse to the idea of a French faction? His right hon. friend admitted the general loyalty of the people of Ireland; but still said, there was a French party in Ireland&#x2014;a French party but contemptible&#x2014;a miserable faction destitute of talents and energy, and of trifling numbers. What he wanted, then, was, to have the nature of this danger ascertained, to see in what it consisted, to find out the strength of this French faction, and, if so contemptible as his right
<image src="S1V0009P0I0641"/>
<col>1217</col>
hon. friend had said, to apply a remedy equal to the disease, and not to overturn the whole constitution of the country on account of a wretched faction. His right hon. friend close by him, (Mr. Windham,) had said, that he seemed to hold the concessions to the Roman Catholics cheap. He certainly had never done so, and his right hon. friend was mistaken. He had said, that if what was called Catholic emancipation was granted without some other measures in favour of the poorer classes, it might excite envy and jealousy in them&#x2014;the benefits to them they would consider as not running <i>pari passu,</i> with those of their superiors, and certainly without some caution what was intended to promote harmony, might become the excitement to contention. But, what did the bill proposed by the late administration in favour of the Catholics do?&#x2014;It certainly did a great deal indeed when it proposed to abolish the restrictions on the Roman Catholic officer, when he came to a certain rank; an officer who stood in the singular situation, that he rose till he had an opportunity of doing some act worthy of preferment, and however great the services he might perform, there he stopped, and the disabilities under which he laboured, damped his ardour, and rendered him less fit or disposed for enterprise and exertion. The unfortunate Catholic officer might, therefore, be said to rise to his degradation. The removal of such restrictions was doing much, and the best effects would certainly have followed from the adoption of such a measure. Was it not better to put confidence in the Irish than to bind them down by restrictions? The enemy might hope to break their chains, but they could not expect to turn towards them those hearts, that had been conciliated by kindness and confidence. Instead, therefore, of putting them on trial, his wish certainly would be, to give them the benefits of the constitution before they mustered in the field. Instead of the yoke of slavery, he would hang the privilege of the constitution about their necks, and arm them with their rights. He again repeated, that if no other good effect should result from this motion, than an acknowledgment, on the part of parliament, of the importance of the subject, the motion ought to be adopted. Charles the First asked Seldon "What was the best way to put down a rebellion?" to which Seldon answered, "remove the cause." He begged of the government to apply this

<p><member>Mr. Fuller </member><membercontribution>thought that a proper and just view of the state of Ireland, could not be obtained without an enquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Cochrane Johnstone</member> <membercontribution>supported the resolution; and thought that parliament would become discredited in Ireland, if on all occasions a deal ear was turned to the complaints of the people of Ireland.&#x2014;The house then divided; For Mr. Sheridan's motion 33; Against it 76.

the 1st of April 1806, was 20,003; the number between July 1806 and July 1807, 17,689, being 2,314 less than in the former year; whereas the number of boys included in the 17,689, exceeded by 1,076 the number included in the 20,003, the preceding year's produce.</p>
<p>III. c.&#x2014;That the number of men obtained for regular service, including men transferred from the militia (and exclusive of foreign and colonial levies) was, between July 1805 and July 1806, 33,693 men; between July 1806 and July 1807, 20,681, being 13,012 men less than in the preceding year, exclusive of the services of the men raised in the latter years being determinable in seven or ten year, according to the terms of their enlistment.</p>
<p>III. D.&#x2014;That whilst the number of men levied in the latter year was less than in the former, as stated in the preceding Resolutions, an annual additional charge of 450,000<i>l</i>. in increased pay and pensions to the army has been incurred, as an encouragement to induce men to enlist, being at the rate of about 25<i>l</i>. per man; on the number of men raised within the year; and which expence must be here after largely increased, in proportion as the pensions on 14 and 21 years service come into operation.</p>
<p>III. E.&#x2014;That during the former year the recruiting parties did not exceed in number 405; that in the latter year they had been increased to 1,113, exclusive of above 400 extra recruiting officers; and from the 8th of Dec. 1806, 54 second battalions have been recruiting, under an intimation, that if they did not raise 400 men each in 6 months, the battalions would be then reduced, and the officers placed on half-pay; which extraordinary increase of the number of recruiting parties must be considered not only as highly prejudicial to the discipline and efficiency of the army, but as so much expence incurred for the levy of men, as distinguished from the performance of regimental duty.</p>

<p>VI.&#x2014;That among the number raised in the first six months of 1807, being 11,413 men, 8,035 have been raised by the 54 second battalions; that is, by officers recruiting to avoid reduction.</p>
<p>VII. and VIII.&#x2014;That, with the exception of 6,242 men transferred to garrison battalions, all men raised under the Army of Reserve and Additional Force acts have been since enlisted into the line, being of the age and height required by his majesty's regulations; and amongst the men so transferred to garrison battalions, are included all men who did not choose to enter for general service, without reference to age or height.</p>
<p>XI.&#x2014;That the men volunteering from limited to unlimited service, from 1st July 1806, to 1st January 1807, received ten guineas bounty for only extending their service from local to general service; whereas before that period (the bounty being the same) the men transferring themselves to the line, exchanged their service, not only from home to foreign service, but from service limited in point of time to service for life; and the men in the latter period, who refused to transfer their services, were ordered to be drafted into garrison battalions.</p>
<p>TRANSPORTS.&#x2014;I. That the transports at home on the first of March 1806, consisted of 380 ships, and 87,717 tons; of which 50 ships and 16,894 tons were fitted for foreign service, and including tonnage for 1,785 horses.&#x2014;That the transports at home, on the 24th of March 1807, were 73 ships, and 16,468 tons, of which only 25 ships and 7,807 tons were fitted for foreign service; there being an excess of 307 ships and 71,249 tons at the former period, compared with the latter; and of 25 ships and 9,087 tons fitted for foreign service; in the latter period, the provision was only for 148 horses.</p>
<p>II.&#x2014;That the above provision of tonnage on the 24th of March 1807, of 73 ships and 16, 468 tons, would have been further re-
<image src="S1V0009P0I0644"/>
<col>1223</col>
duced under the orders of the treasury of the 22d of January 1807, in the amount of 29 ships and 8,586 tons, had not the full execution of the above orders been prevented by the contracts of 17 being such as to prevent their being paid off, and by nine being under quarantine, having returned on the 20th of March preceding from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>III.&#x2014;That the transports on home service, on the 8th of August 1807, consisted of 401 ships and 82,143 tons; of which 67 ships and 20,289 tons were fitted for foreign service, including also a provision for 4,089 horses.</p>

<p><member>[THE LORDS COMMISSIONERS' SPEECH]</member>.<membercontribution> About a quarter before four, the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, earl Camden, and lord Hawkesbury took their seats as his majesty's commissioners. Mr. Quarme, the deputy usher of the black rod, was sent to the commons, to require their attendance. Shortly afterwards the Speaker and a number of the members came to the bar, and the royal assent was given to several bills. After which,</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The Lord Chancellor </member>, <membercontribution>in his majesty's name, delivered the following Speech:&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p align="center"><membercontribution>My Lords and Gentlemen;<lb/>
"We have it in command from his majesty to express the satisfaction with which he finds himself enabled to give you that recess which, after the great and diligent exertions you have made in the dispatch of public business, must at this advanced season of the year, be so peculiarly desirable.&#x2014;His majesty has been graciously pleased to direct us to return you his thanks for the steady loyalty and attachment to his person and government, and the zealous devotion to the public service which have characterized all your deliberations, and most especially to thank you for the seasonable exertions which you have enabled him to make for the augmentation of the military force of his kingdom.<lb/>
"Gentlemen of the House of Commons;<lb/>
"His majesty has commanded us to return you his warmest thanks for the supplies which you have granted with so much cheerfulness for the current year; and when he considers the provision which you have made for those contingent and unforeseen services which the events of the war may render necessary, his majesty has the greatest satisfaction in recognizing the wisdom wherewith, in a time of extraordinary difficulties, you have anticipated
<col>1224</col>
the possible demands which those difficulties may occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p align="center"><membercontribution>"My Lords, and Gentlemen;<lb/>
"His majesty commands us to assure you, that he deeply deplores the unfortunate issue of the war upon the continent.&#x2014;The immense extension of the power and influence of France, and the undisguised determination of the enemy to employ the means and resources of those countries which he possesses or controuls, for the purpose of effecting the ruin of his majesty's kingdom, undoubtedly present a formidable view of the difficulties and dangers which this country has to encounter.&#x2014;But his majesty trusts, that the loyal and brave people over whom he reigns are not to be daunted or disheartened,&#x2014;From the recollection of those difficulties under which his people have successfully struggled, and of those dangers which they have happily surmounted, his majesty derives the consolation of believing, that the same spirit and perseverance which have hitherto remained unbroken will continue to be exerted with unabated vigour and success.&#x2014;And while his majesty commands us to repeat the assurances of his constant readiness to entertain any proposals which may lead to a secure and honourable peace, he commands us at the same time to express his confidence that his parliament and his people will feel with him, the necessity of persevering in those vigorous efforts which alone can give the character of honour to any negotiations, or the prospect of security or permanency to any peace; his majesty, therefore, trusts that his parliament and his people will always be ready to support him in every measure which may be necessary to defeat the designs of his enemies against the independence of his majesty's dominions, and to maintain against any undue pretensions, and against any hostile confederacy, those just rights which his majesty is always desirous to exercise with temper and moderation, but which, as essential to the honour of his crown, and true interests of his people, he is determined never to surrender."&#x2014;A commission for proroguing parliament to Thursday, the 24th of September, was then read. After which, the lord Chancellor, declared the parliament to be prorogned to Thursday, the 24th of September next, to be then there holden.</membercontribution></p>

<p>A little before four o'clock the deputy
<image src="S1V0009P0I0645"/>
<col>1225</col>
usher of the black rod summoned the house to the house of peers, to hear the commission read. On their return, the Speaker called the members round the table, and having read to them the Speech delivered.</p>
<p><member>[MILITIA TRANSFER BILL.]</member> <membercontribution>The following will be found a more correct report of the Speech of Lord Sidmouth on the 12th of August, than the one inserted at page 1181.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Sidmouth</member> <membercontribution>said, there were a few points to which he was desirous of adverting previous to their lordships' final decision upon this bill. It had been acknowledged on a former day by the noble secretary of state (lord Hawkesbury), that his majesty's ministers, after having determined upon the expediency of augmenting our military force, had balanced between the present measure, and the renewal of the Army of Reserve. He had himself made such a comparison, but, for reasons which he had before stated, he had come to a different conclusion. He indeed recollected, and with great satisfaction, that all the members of his majesty's present government, whether in, or out of office, in the years 1803 and 1804, had supported the measure which he now preferred: and in the spring of 1804, when, in consequence of the high rate of bounties occasioned by the number of men (195,000, exclusive of volunteers) raised within 13 months, he proposed only a suspension of this measure, that proposition was resisted by a large minority of the house of commons, and particularly by a right hon. gent. now unhappily no more (Mr. Pitt), who declared that he should recommend the compulsory principle of that bill as the basis of a plan for the increase of our domestic force, and for the permanent supply of the army. This intention was indeed afterwards abandoned, under circumstances, into which, for reasons which, he trusted, were obvious, he did not now wish to enter. But even after this change of intention, the army of reserve was highly and continually applauded, and he was convinced that if the life of the distinguished person to whom he had alluded had been spared, that he would himself have recommended it to the adoption of parliament.&#x2014;But the noble baron (lord Hawkesbury) had stated, that the chief objection to the renewal of this measure, was founded upon the remission of the
<col>1226</col>
by the lords commissioners, the members separated.&#x2014;Thus ended the first session of the fourth parliament of the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.<lb/>
fines in those places, where the required quota of men for the army of reserve had not been raised. This, he begged leave to say, was not accurate either in reasoning, or in statement. If such an example was injurious in its tendency, which he acknowledged it to be, however unavoidable in the particular case, the argument was as strong against a ballot for the militia, as for the army of reserve; as the remission of the fines afforded the same encouragement to neglect in one case, as in the other. But, in fact, the observation did not fairly apply to the army of reserve at all. It was true that under the act by which that force was to be constituted, penalties were to be levied where the number of men required to be raised by ballot, had not been procured; but by Mr. Pitt's Additional Force bill those penalties were transferred to a failure in procuring a number of men (equal to the deficiencies in the army of reserve), not by ballot, as under the Army of Reserve bill, but by voluntary recruiting, through the agency of parish officers for a limited bounty; and it was one of the numerous objections to that measure, that it inflicted punishment in cases where there might have been no neglect. This injustice had been illustrated at the time, by comparing it to that of directing a person, when wheat was 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per bushel, to purchase that quantity for 5<i>s</i>., and to fine him if he could not procure it at such a price. And what in fact had been the operation of that bill? Of the intended and expected number a small part only had been raised, and of that part not a moiety by the means required by the bill, notwithstanding the official exhortations of the noble baron (lord H.), which had the obvious and recorded effect of checking the ordinary recruiting service, for the purpose of giving ostensible success to this favoured measure. It failed however in all respects; and it would have been the height of injustice to levy penalties where there had been no misconduct, and where the fault was not in the agents but in the measure itself. The remission of the fines must therefore be admitted to afford a striking comment on
<image src="S1V0009P0I0646"/>
<col>1227</col>
the inefficacy and injustice of the Additional Force bill, but no argument whatever against the renewal of the army of reserve. But the noble lord had laid great stress on the advantages which would arise from the possession of a large body of militia upon the restoration of peace; as in that event all who had served 5 years would be disbanded. This, however, has a contingent benefit: if the war continued 5 years longer, it would not occur; and the reasoning, upon which it was founded, went the length of asserting, that such a measure as the present, with all the inconveniences attending it, ought always to be resorted to, when hostilities had been of four or
<col>1228</col>
five years continuance; and that the country would be made weaker for a time during war, for the chance of being rendered somewhat stronger, than it would otherwise be, on the restoration of peace. This argument, however, appeared to him to be a feeble attempt to support an exceptionable measure, the execution of which, even if successful, would, by disturbing and unsettling the militia, impair, in the first instance, our actual means of defence, and afterwards afford an augmentation ill suited and inadequate to the present exigency, and to the perilous situation of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<p>This Account contains all Exemptions granted upon the Dividends which have become payable Since the Duty was stopped at the Bank of England. Previous to that Period, the Agents to Foreigners entitled to Exemptions did not pay the Duty, but omitted, for the most part, to claim the Exemptions in the manner required by the Act. Any Account of the Exemptions actually granted upon former Dividends would, therefore, afford no criterion to judge of the Exemptions to which the Parties were entitled.</p>
<p>The Total Annual Amount of Exemptions may be estimated at nearly &#x00A3;.63,000, being double the Amount of the Exemptions granted upon the Dividends payable on the 5th of July and 10th of October 1806.</p>

<title>PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.</title>
<p>FIRST REPORT FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, &amp;C. OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. <i>Presented to the House of Commons, July 22,</i> 1807.</p>
<section>
<title>PAY-OFFICE</title>
<p>The Committee, appointed to examine and consider what Regulations and Checks have been established, in order to controul the several branches of the Public Expenditure in Great Britain and Ireland; and how far the same have been effectual; and what further Measures can be adopted for reducing any Part of the said Expenditure, or diminishing the Amount of Salaries and Emoluments, without detriment to the Public Service;</p>
<p>HAVING had referred to their consideration the proceedings of the committee which was instituted for the same purposes in the last parliament, began their enquiries, by prosecuting the examination of a subject, in which considerable progress had been made, but upon which they have delayed making an earlier report, judging it proper to suspend any statement of facts, until they could at the same time recommend the best mode, according to their judgment, of preventing similar abuses in future. The evidence received during the last session, contains an account of two transactions in the pay-office, of a most irregular, and improper kind, which were disclosed on the examination of Mr. Thomas, accountant in that office; by whom it was stated, that a draft for 7,000<i>l.</i> payable to the right hon. Thomas Steele (at that time one of the joint paymasters) or bearer, had been drawn by the cashier on the 11th of May 1799, under the head of extraordinaries of the army, and entered in the cash account of the office; with Mr. Steele's receipt as a voucher; and that another sum of 12,800<i>l.</i> was drawn for, precisely in the same manner, and a receipt given in the same terms, on the 3d of July, 1800. Of these two sums, the first was not repaid until the 3d of February, 1807; nor the latter until the 8th of April, with interest upon both sums, from the date of their issue to that of their repayment, amounting to 7,390<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> The correspondence between Mr. Steele and Mr. Thomas; letters of earl Temple (one of the joint-paymasters in 1807), addressed to lord Grenville, Mr. Steele, Mr. Rose, and lord Harrowby; three minutes of the lords of the treasury, directing what steps should be taken for se
<col>lxviii</col>
curing the sum remaining due (for the first sum had been repaid previous to any Proceedings of the board of treasury); minutes of the paymaster-general entered in the book of the office; and several other papers, are inserted at length in the Appendix, though no<ob/> perhaps absolutely necessary for understanding the subject, that no circumstance which has reference to this business, may be withheld from observation. But the part to which the committee think it most material to direct the attention of the house, is the account given by Mr. Steele himself, when he desired to attend the former committee on the 26th of March 1807, and made his own statement of the circumstances relating to these transactions. He said, 'The two sums mentioned by Mr. Thomas were issued by my direction, and I have no hesitation in stating that they were not issued for public service; I thought, as others did at the time, that I had full authority to direct those issues. I was urged to do so by private considerations of a very peculiar nature, which operated at that time upon my mind; and I thought that by directing them to be issued to myself, and making myself responsible for them, I could not by possibility incur the suspicion of concealment, or fraud. It was my intention that they should have been replaced in a very short time, but it was not in my power to accomplish it; they remained charged against me in the pay-office book till the beginning of the present year, when the former of the two sums was repaid; and the whole subject having been brought lately under the consideration of the board of treasury, they have directed me to repay the remaining sum, with the interest due upon both sums, by instalments at stated periods, which I have engaged to do. I cannot take upon myself to defend my conduct in this instance, which I must admit to have been incorrect, but I console myself with thinking that the public will have suffered no loss." And being asked, Whether he knew of any other transaction of the same kind, during the time he was in the pay-office? he said, "I do not." And being asked, Whether he knew of any arrear of the like nature arising from the transaction of any former paymaster? he said, "I certainly do not." And being asked, Whether any notice was taken of this transaction by the treasury, previous to the beginning of this year? he said, "I apprehend it was not ever known to the treasury, previous to this year." And being asked, whether any notice was taken by any otter public office? he said, "Not to my know
<image src="S1V0009P0I0683"/>
<col>lxix</col>
ledge."&#x2014;On the 13th of April, Mr. Steele again attended the committee; and a part of lord Temple's letters being read to him (Appendix, No. 3.); and he being asked, Whether he had any explanation to give in reference to this letter? he said, "This being a statement of what passed in different conversations at different times, of which I made no memorandum myself, I certainly am not disposed to dispute the accuracy with which it is reported. I beg the committee at the same time to understand that I never have attempted to justify the issue of the two sums in question, upon the ground that they were applied directly or indirectly to public service; but that in my former evidence I acknowledged that they were not issued with any reference to public service, but I alone was responsible and accountable for them; and that I have, in fact, repaid them both, principal and interest." And a part of Mr. Steele's former examination, and an extract from his letter to Mr. Thomas, being shown to him, he further said, "The persons to whom I alluded in that letter, and in my examination, were the principal officers of the pay-office, who had long been established there, and who uniformly contended that the power of the paymaster-general to direct the issues of money from the bank remained unlimited by any of the provisions of the act for regulating the office of paymaster general." And being asked, "Did you consult any other person as to the operation of that act, upon the issue of money to the pay-master?" he said, "I did not." And being asked, Whether in point of fact, in any part of this transaction, he acted upon the opinions of any other persons, conjointly with his own, or consulted any other person on the subject? he said, "No."&#x2014;The conduct of Mr. Rose, who succeeded Mr. Steele in the pay-office, being observed upon, in a minute of the paymaster, dated 27th of February 1807, Mr. Rose attended the committee, for the purpose of explaining the knowledge he had of this transaction; and he stared, that the facts relating to the two sums issued to Mr. Steele were communicated to him on the 10th February 1806, by Mr. Bradshaw, in the presence of Mr. Harmood and Mr. Thomas; but that, as he considered himself completely out of office at that time, he could not interfere officially, nor apply any Possible remedy; that he had, however, desired Mr. Thomas to write to Mr. Steele, that he might insure his seeing him, and to let him (Mr. Rose) know, whether any interposition of his with Mr. Steele, would be necessary; that he had
<col>lxx</col>
also a personal interview with Mr. Steele, and afterwards wrote a letter to him, enforcing what he had recommended in convertion; as the answer to which led him to rest satisfied that the whole matter would be communicated, without delay, to lord Grenville, or the paymaster-general.&#x2014;As no entry was made of these two sums in the extraordinaries of time army presented to parliament, it became an object of enquiry, for what reason they were not included? to which Mr. Wood, deputy cashier in the pay-office, answered, that they were omitted by the express order of Mr. Steele; and, upon being further examined, he said, that other sums had also been omitted in a former year (1797) by Mr. Steele's direction, which had been advanced to Messrs. Carey, Pratburnon, and Bryan; adding, that without such particular direction he should have thought it his duty to include all those sums. In one of Mr. Steele's letters, it is to be observed, that the reason which he assigns for this omission is, "that the sums so issued, being intended to be replaced at an earlier period, could not with propriety have formed part of the army extraordinaries." If such has been the rule of that office in making up the account of extraordinaries, and if it has been also usual that all sums so issued, if replaced before the delivery of the accounts to the auditors, should not appear at all in those accounts, your committee judge both these practices highly improper to be continued, because they tend to keep back from the house, in the first instance, and finally from the auditors, the full knowledge of the disposal of the public money, and to facilitate the temporary application of sums to purposes of a different nature from those to which they are destined by the votes of parliament&#x2014;The money issued to Mr. Carey, and the two others in 1797, was for the purpose of procuring a supply of specie for army services, from Hamburgh, at a time when there was great difficulty in obtaining it, owing to the restriction of payments in cash, by the bank. Mr. Boyd undertook to import a large sum, and the persons who receive the money, which amounted to 100,000<i>l.</i> by the paymaster's drafts on the bank, were nominated by Mr. Boyd, for the purpose of keeping the transaction secret, which he judged necessary for its success.&#x2014;The service was not performed; and the principal sum so issued was repaid by Mr. Boyd, in the following year, by a similar sum which he received on account of another service, (the remitting of money to the Cape of Good Hope for the payment of Troops)
<image src="S1V0009P0I0684"/>
<col>lxxi</col>
which he contracted with government to perform; in which he also failed. The question of interest upon the 100,000<i>l.</i> was involved in the discussion of some claims preferred by Mr. Boyd, against government; and the repayment of the second sum is still in a course of legal proceeding, in consequence of the bankruptcy of the house of Messrs. Boyd and Co. when proper steps were immediately taken for recovering it, by direction from the lords of the treasury; and your committee are informed, that the principal difficulties which have prevented a satisfactory title from being made to purchasers (under this bankruptcy) are now nearly adjusted, and in the course of the next term, it is probable that the most considerable purchasers will be ready to complete their purchases, and to pay their purchase-money into court.&#x2014;Upon the important subject of recommending measures which may prevent similar abuses in future, your committee observe with great concern, that the most obvious, and perhaps the only effectual remedy has been found by experience hitherto unattainable; but they think it necessary to represent as their deliberate opinion, that without an earlier examination, and auditing of accounts, irregularities can hardly be prevented; and that temptation will never be wanting to make use of public money, while there exists a great probability of its being for a long time uncalled for. After the accounts come before the commissioners for auditing, no attention is wanting in requiring proper warrants in discharge for every payment, and no sum is allowed without a voucher of that kind; but so slow has been the progress hitherto, that notwithstanding the observations made on the subject by the committee of Finance in 1797 and 1798, not one account of any paymaster-general has been finally settled and declared nor made ready for declaration, in the nine or ten years which have since elapsed.&#x2014;Parts of the accounts and vouchers for the year 1782, were delivered to the auditors in 1788, 1789, 1791, and 1798; parts of those for 1783 were delivered to them in 1792 and 1798; part of those for 1784, in 1794; and part of those for 1785, in 1797. It appears also that a supplementary account of the paymaster-general, from 24 April to 24 December 1782, and a supplementary account for 1783, were delivered into their office, together with the attested accounts for 1784 and 1785, no longer ago than on the 9th of February last.&#x2014;A letter from the chairman of that board affords a reasonable expectation that the account of the paymaster
<col>lxxii</col>
general for the year 1782 will be finally audited, and ready for declaration about Christmas next; and that, provided there be no delay in the delivery of the subsequent accounts, the present arrear of the pay-office accounts may be cleared at the auditor's office in the course of five or six years. It will be the duty of your committee, should they be re-appointed, in the ensuing session, to make an early enquiry into the progress which shall have been made during the recess, and to consider how far the provisions of the act of 46th Geo. III c. 141, under which the present board of commissioners for auditing the public accounts was appointed, have contributed to the object they were intended to answer, by facilitating the due examination and more speedy settlement of the public accounts; and whether any and what further regulations may be devised, for the attainment of so important and desirable an end.&#x2014;Although some effectual improvement in that system, would be the most radical and substantial remedy, there are other subordinate measures fit to be enforced immediately, for which the regulations of office may in a great degree be sufficient; and legislative provision may be added wherever it becomes necessary.&#x2014;Much of the delay, which occurs in procuring the clearing and covering warrants from the war-office, without which the paymaster's accounts cannot be examined by the auditors, may be removed, by making the transactions between these two offices more simple and methodical. It would be desirable in all instances to issue warrants at once, instead of transacting so much of the ordinary business by letters, which has formed a constant subject of complaint on the part of the paymasters; and it appears, that if warrants on account were granted by the secretary at war for regimental services not completed within the year, the paymaster's accounts might be delivered soon after the end of every year to the auditors for examination &#x2014;The issue of money being in fact made originally upon the authority of the letter only, no other enquiry seems to be made in granting the subsequent warrant, than whether it agrees with the letter; and therefore any additional signatures to the warrant, which bear the appearance of further check and examination, add in reality no sort of security to the public, while the responsibility (which can never be desirable) becomes divided between two offices.&#x2014;Your committee see no sort of necessity for every individual warrant being signed by his majesty, nor for its being countersigned by the lords of the treasury, ex
<image src="S1V0009P0I0685"/>
<col>lxxiii</col>
cept where money is issued by their orders. In all cases where the treasury is not concerned, the money is now actually paid upon the requisition of the secretary at war, and his name alone ought to stand as sufficient authority for the warrant, making him, in whose department it is, responsible for the service and the expenditure.&#x2014;It would be Sufficient for his majesty, in whom all money is originally vested by grant of parliament, to sign a warrant for large sums from time to time, leaving the detail of the application of them, as is the practice with regard to monies issued on account of the navy, and the ordnance, to the department under whose directions the particular service is performed.&#x2014;The delay occasioned by the warrants being taken up by army agents, instead of being directly returned to the pay office through their own officers, ought to be entirely obviated, as it seems already to have been in some degree, with regard to what are called clearing warrants for regimental services. No reason appears why they should pass at all into the agent's hands, who may have an indirect interest in withholding them, and for the passing of whose accounts they are in no degree requisite.&#x2014;Another regulation proper to be adopted, is a different manner of making out the accounts of extraordinaries to be laid before parliament, which the present paymaster informed your committee that he had directed to be done in future; and that an account should be regularly kept in the office, classed under the same heads as those for which the grants of parliament are annually voted.&#x2014;No sums which have been issued in the course of the year, ought ever to be left out of the account of extraordinaries annually laid before parliament, for they create a temporary deficiency in the balance of the paymaster's cash, even if they are to be repaid; they therefore should be noticed in the first account after the issue by a memorandum, as sums not ultimately to be charged upon the public; and credit should be taken for them in any subsequent account, when they are actually replaced at the Bank. It would also tend materially to the clearness of all these accounts, if no articles of expenditure were inserted, but such as relate strictly to the army; instead of which, it is to be observed, that issues of money for the purchase of corn, and various miscellaneous purposes not directly relating to that service, have not unfrequently been admitted into them, and inter mixed with army services; which your committee conceive to belong more properly to the particulars of the distribution of any vote of credit which may be granted for the year in which
<col>lxxiv</col>
such articles appear.&#x2014;A greater regularity in bringing up the accounts in the office itself, is essential in various points of view; and the attention of the paymaster himself is particularly necessary for insuring the attendance, and application of all the officers who are under him, and for enforcing a more punctual and accurate discharge of their duty, than appears to have hitherto prevailed. Their books should be frequently balanced, and the cash-book ought always to be made up to the latest period possible; to the neglect of which it is in some measure owing, that it has been impossible to conform to the provisions of the statute 45 Geo. III. c. 58; and the consequence has been, that ever since the passing of that act, the 5th sect. prescribing the mode in which the monthly memorials are to be presented to the Treasury; and the 8th clause in the Auditor's Act, 46 Geo. III. c. 141. sect. 8. requiring all accountants to deliver in within three months after the end of each year, an account current of all sums received and paid by them within the year, have been totally disregarded.&#x2014;It would have been necessary in this place, to observe upon the imperfect manner in which the entries of money paid by individuals to the paymaster's account, have been made by the clerks of the Bank in the cash-book of the office, if your committee had not received an assurance from the Governor of the Bank, that directions have been given to discontinue this practice, with regard to this, and all other public offices.&#x2014;The practical inconvenience to which the former mode was liable, appeared in a remarkable instance, in the course of the last year, when no less a sum than 291,348<i>l.</i> remained for about four months in the Bank, without any information of the payment being given to the paymaster; which, though he ought certainly to have received from the accountant in his office, who was employed in making the payment, yet no good reason can be assigned why the negligence of that officer was not corrected by a communication from the Bank. A larger issue of money from the Exchequer, to the amount of that sum, than would otherwise have been required, must have been the consequence, and the public were of course either unnecessarily increasing exchequer bills, and paying interest for a sum which ought to have been at their disposal; or services which were to be paid with this money must have been suffered to remain unsatisfied.&#x2014;The act 45 Geo. III. c. 58, having repealed that of 1783, is now the only subsisting act for regulating the business of this office; and it therefore became the duty of your committee to examine
<image src="S1V0009P0I0686"/>
<col>lxxv</col>
how far it had been complied with, or had been found effectual, in the remaining points which it attempts to regulate.&#x2014;The time of making up the accounts, directed by sect. 21, has not been observed, any more than the clause in the Auditor's act, 46 Geo. III. c. 141. sect. 8. above referred to. The clause with regard to regimental agents, sect. 23. has indeed been attended to in terms, but it has been found of little use in practice; because the paymaster, having no means of knowing the balance in the hands of agents, has no method of controverting the statements which they may think proper to deliver in, as to the aggregate balance of their accounts, it being always possible, that though an agent may be a debtor for one regiment (where he is concerned for several), he may be a creditor on account of another.&#x2014;The books of the office have been brought up, subsequent to the enquiry of the former committee, to as late a date as the nature of the case admits of; but at that period, and when the present paymaster was appointed in April 1807, the fair cash-book was not brought up later than to the Month of November 1806; nor were the accounts frequently, nor regularly balanced.&#x2014;It would hardly have been deemed requisite to point out the propriety of appointing persons duly qualified by their knowledge of writing and arithmetic, and of a sufficient age to discharge the duties of clerks in the office, if the present paymaster had not very lately found it necessary to discharge some of those who had been admitted into the office, on account of their insufficiency and in-experience.&#x2014;If your committee do not recommend any alteration in the power of drawing for money (to whatever amount) which is at present vested in the paymaster, or in the cashier, it is not from any want of consideration bestowed upon this part of the subject: but they are at a loss to know, if it be withdrawn from those officers, in whom it can be lodged more properly, or with absolute security; for it is unquestionable, that in some department or other of government, it must necessarily be placed. If more signatures than one should be required to every draft, there is great risk of the public service being continually retarded, and the inconveniences will be much greater, if delays should be interposed in the first instance, of the same sort with those which now occur after the payments are made, and which tend only to obstruct the settlement of account, but not the service itself. It would inevitaby follow, from any such division of responsibility, that,
<col>lxxvi</col>
in the multiplicity of public business, credit would be given implicitly by one department of government to another, that the form of signing would soon become a matter of course, and that the paymaster would act under as little practical restraint as he does at present. If the paymaster and the cashier should be directed jointly to sign every draft, some sort of additional check may perhaps be laid upon the latter, but none will be felt by the head of the office: and it is obvious that if such had been the established practice of the office before the date of the two drafts, which have given occasion to this enquiry, the paymaster would not in the slightest degree have been precluded by it, from drawing for the money in the very mode he did, nor from detaining it, for as long a time, in his possession.&#x2014;The whole business of the pay-office is so intimately connected with that of the war-office, that it is hardly possible to report fully upon the former, without entering into an ample examination of the latter; but in the particulars which have been pointed out, their reiative situation admits of alteration, with advantage to the public, as far at least as may be sufficient to prevent the paymaster's accounts from waiting for the auditing of those of army agents, and others, in which he has no concern, and over whom he has no control. To examine whether he has discharged his duty by issuing money upon regular vouchers, proceeding either from the war-office or the treasury, cannot be a matter of intricacy, or delay; and if the secretary at war should be authorized to grant warrants upon account for all services not completed within the year, and to grant upon his sole authority warrants for all other services, as more formal and regular documents than letters, for every payment, the same practice being also introduced into the treasury, when any issues are directed by that board for army services; and if, further, the auditors should be empowered and required by an alteration of the act, (if necessary) to examine separately the accounts of the extraordinaries as soon as they are presented to them, and to compare every payment with the bank cash-book, there is every reason to expect, not only that every paymaster's account might be settled within a short period after the expiration of each year, but that a substantial check would be provided against all temptation to withdraw money from the service for which it is granted, when the detection of any such misapplication must immediately follow the examination of the annual accounts compared with the cash-book of the bank. This opinion of your committee is fortified by that of
<image src="S1V0009P0I0687"/>
<col>lxxvii</col>
the chairman of the board for auditing accounts, who stated his belief, that if the cash accounts required by the 46 Geo. III. 141. sect. 8. were delivered into the audit-office, as well as the accounts of service also referred to in that section, and if the cash accounts were compared with the accountant's bank book, it would not be possible for the paymasters general, or any other public accountant, to receive public money upon drafts made payable to himself, without that circumstance falling under the observation of the commissioners.&#x2014;With regard to regimental accounts, and the difficulties which occur in expediting and settling them, some judicious suggestions have been received by your committee, which will deserve further consideration, whenever the mode of keeping and passing accounts in the war-office shall come under their examination. That the present system is defective, may be concluded from a long experience of its being found totally inadequate to obtain the two main objects, of perspicuity, and expedition; but whether it should be absolutely changed, or partially modified, your committee have not as yet received information sufficient to determine. The simplification of the branch connected with the pay-office, in the manner they have suggested, they venture to recommend as unquestionably beneficial; and they trust that the same principle may be extended with success to every other department of the military expenditure. <i>Extracts from the Appendix.&#x2014;Examination of the right hon. Thomas Steele, March 26, 1807.</i></p>
<p>The two sums mentioned by Mr. Thomas, were issued by my direction, and I have no hesitation in stating that they were not issued for public service. I thought as others did at the time, that I had full authority to direct those issues. I was urged to do so by private considerations of a very popular nature, which operated at that time upon my mind; and I thought that by directing them to be issued to myself, and making myself responsible for them, that I could not, by possibility, incur the suspicion of concealment or fraud. It was my intention, that they should have been replaced in a very short time, but it was not in my power to accomplish it. They remain charged against me in the pay-office books till the beginning of the present year, when the former of the two sums was repaid; and the whole subject having been brought lately under the consideration of the board of treasury, they have directed me to repay the remaining sum, with the interest due upon both sums, by instalments at stated periods, which I engaged to do. I cannot take
<col>lxxviii</col>
upon myself to defend my conduct in this instance, which I must admit to have been incorrect: but I console myself with thinking, that the public will have suffered no loss.&#x2014;Do you know of any other transaction of the same kind, during the time you was in the pay-office? I do not.&#x2014;Of any arrear of the like nature, arising from the transaction of any former paymaster? I certainly do not.&#x2014;Was any notice taken of this transaction by the treasury, previous to the beginning of this year? I apprehend it was not known to the treasury, ever previous to this year.&#x2014;Was any notice taken by any other public office? Not to my knowledge.</p>

I beg the committee at the same time to understand, that I never have attempted to justify the issue of the two sums in question, upon the ground that they were applied directly or indirectly to public service; but that in my former evidence I acknowledge that they were not issued with any reference to public service, but that I alone was responsible and accountable for them, and that I have in fact repaid them both, principal and interest.&#x2014;[Read Mr. Steele's former examination, and extract of a letter from him to Mr. Thomas.]&#x2014;Question repeated.&#x2014;The persons to whom I allude in that letter, and in my examination, were the principal officers of the pay-office, who had long been established there, and who uniformly contended, that the power of the paymaster-general to direct the issues of money from the bank remained unlimited by any of the provisions of the act for regulating the office of paymaster-general.&#x2014;Did you consult any other person as to the operation of that act upon the issue of money to the paymaster?

<p>You are desired to state, when and in what manner you became acquainted with the transactions relating to Mr. Steele's two drafts. On Monday the 10th of February,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0688"/>
<col>lxxix</col>
1806, Mr. Thomas, with Mr. Harmood, and Mr. Bradshaw, two of the senior clerks of the pay-office, came to my house; and, after some conversation on other subjects, when they were leaving the room, Mr. Bradshaw, under some apparent embarrassment, said he wished to apprize me of a circumstance of an extraordinary nature which had occurred in the time of my predecessors: that Mr. Steele had, in the year 1800, taken two sums of 7,000<i>l.</i>, and 12,000<i>l.</i> out of the cash in the hands of the paymaster-general, on giving his own receipt for the same; which receipt was written by Mr. Wood, deputy cashier, without any authority having appeared for the same, either from the treasury or the war-office; at which statement I expressed great surprise, and to Mr. Thomas some resentment, at the same having been delayed till I was out of office, and could apply no possible remedy, observing, the transaction was, on the face of it at least, a most irregular one; but that, from my long knowledge of Mr. Steele, I was perfectly sure he would be able to explain it, so as to acquit himself of having done any thing more, than taking upon himself a serious responsibility; that he probably had a voucher in his possession, but that in any event, it had been his (Mr. Thomas's) indispensable duty to remind that gentleman of the transaction on his quitting office in 1804, in order, that if it had not been satisfactorily explained, he might then have stated it to me and my colleagues, on our appointment: to which Mr. Thomas answered, he had called two or three times at Mr. Steele's door, without finding him at home: such a justification appeared to render his conduct still less excusable; because if he thought it necessary to see Mr. Steele on the subject, he certainly should have apprised him of his wish to do so, that he might be sure of meeting with him. I therefore desired him to write to Mr Steele, to insure his seeing him, and to let me know, on my return from Bugden, whether any interposition of mine with Mr. Steele would be necessary: on the 20th, Mr. Thomas came to me accordingly, when he told me that he had seen Mr. Steele, who said generally, that the sums before mentioned as received by him, were for army services Whether, subsequent to the communication made by Mr. Bradshaw in the presence of Mr. Thomas, you had any communication with Mr. Steele on the subject; and if so what was the purport of it? I had a personal communication with Mr. Steele on th 21st of February, which I considered as of a private nature, being out of office; but the
<col>lxxx</col>
particulars of which I am perfectly willing to give.&#x2014;Mr. Rose being desired to proceed, stated, that Mr. Steele declined entering into particulars, not feeling himself at liberty to do it; that the advances were made to a person or persons, he was not sure which, for services of a secret nature; that the whole would be repaid, but he could not at that moment exactly fix the time, acknowledging that he had no warrant, or other authority for the issue: the advice I gave him was, that, under such circumstances, I thought he should see either lord Grenville, or the present paymaster-general, and explain to his lordship, or them, so much of the transaction as should satisfy them,&#x2014;the whole, certainly, if they should think it necessary; adding, that it was by all comparison better he should do that in the first instance from himself, than wait to give an explanation when he should be called upon to do so; especially, as the precedent in this case would shew to future paymasters-general the possibility of their taking money placed in the bank on account of the public, for their own private accommodation, at any time when they should find themselves under a pressing urgency to do so, which was plainly against the spirit of the pay-office act. I wrote to him the same evening, enforcing the advice I had given to him in the morning; in answer to which I received a letter, dated 23d February, 1806:&#x2014;"I will certainly follow your advice, and take an early opportunity of communicating to lord Grenville the circumstances which relate to the issue of the two sums in question: you may therefore, if you think proper, apprise Mr. Thomas of my intention."&#x2014;Whether on the same day that Mr. Bradshaw made the communication relating to Mr. Steele in the presence of Mr. Thomas, you, in the same conversation expressed your willingness to enter in the minute book a minute, recommending to the notice of your successor an increase of salary to the six senior clerks?&#x2014;Of that, I have no recollection, as to its having passed on that day; but the measure having been agreed on by my colleague and myself previously thereto, it may have happened that upon that day I told them I would enter the minute. I have no recollection of the minute being ante dated, but I think it probable it may have been so, as on the 10th I considered myself completely out of office.</p>
<p>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, ON THE COMMERCIAL STATE OF THE WEST-INDIA COLONIES. <i>Ordered to be printed, Aug. 8, 1807.</i></p>
<image src="S1V0009P0I0689"/>
<col>lxxxi</col>
<p>The Committee who were appointed to take into consideration the Commercial State of the West-India colonies, and to report their proceedings, from time to time, to the house of commons; and who were empowered to report the minutes of evidence taken before them; and to whom all minutes of evidence which were taken before the committee in the last session of parliament, on the West-India planters' petitions, together with their proceedings, were referred; have, pursuant to the order of the house, examined the matters to them referred; and have agreed to the following Report:</p>
<p>YOUR committee have thought it their duty, in the first place, to enquire into the situation of the West-India planters at the present moment, and for several years preceding; and have examined various respectable witnesses, proprietors of estates, who have resided many years in the West Indies, and who have had the properties of several absentees under their management; and also many merchants intimately acquainted with the expenses and profits of a great variety of estates, and generally conversant with the West-India commerce. From their testimony it appears, that since the year 1799, there has taken place a progressive deterioration in the situation of the planters, resulting from a progressive diminution of the price of sugar although at the same time the duty, and all the expences attending the cultivation, have been increasing, till at length the depression of the market has become such, that the prices obtained for the last year's crop will not pay the expence of cultivation, except upon estates on a very great scale, making sugar of a very superior quality, or enjoying other extraordinary advantages. Calculations have been laid before your committee, from the accounts of estates both in Jamaica and the other islands, by which it appears, that the British supplies and island expences amount to 20<i>s.</i> and 10<i>d.</i> in the former, and to 19<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the latter, on the cwt. of sugar, after accounting and giving credit for the amount received for the sale of rum. As these calculations are formed upon an average of years and upon estates of the ordinary scale, and in no respects unusually circumstanced, it appears to your committee, that these sums per cwt. of sugar may be taken as the average expense of cultivation, independent of interest upon the capital; and your committee are confirmed in this opinion by finding a similar calculation in the report made by the sugar-distillery committee, in the last parliament. To this must be added an expence of from 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 16<i>s.</i> per cwt.

necessarily incurred for freight, insurance, and other mercantile charges, between the shipping the goods in the colonies, and their being offered to market in this kingdom. forming together an amount of from 35<i>s.</i> to 36<i>s.</i> which appears upon this evidence, to be the absolute cost to the planter per cwt. of sugar before any return of capital can attach. Upon a reference to the average prices published in the gazette, for the last eight months, which vary from 36<i>s.</i> to 31<i>s.</i> giving a mean price of 33<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, it appears evident, that the planters must have cultivated their estates at a loss.&#x2014;The interest which has been stated to your committee as what should be the fair profit upon a capital of such a nature as that of a sugar estate, consisting not merely of land and negroes, but of buildings of great extent and cost, necessary for the carrying on of such manufactures, and subject to various and peculiar risks and vicissitudes, is not less than 10 per cent.&#x2014;During the period of prosperity previous to 1800, it is stated that in general the profits did not exceed that sum; and that, from that period, they have gradually diminished to 2&#x00BD; and 1&#x00BD; per cent. till at the present moment, there is no return of interest whatever.&#x2014;It may perhaps be right to notice one exception, namely of an estate most favourably circumstanced in every respect, where the profits are stated to have amounted during the four years 1795, 1796, 1797, and 1798, to 12 par cent.; but they appear also to have declined ever since; in 1801, 1802, 1803, and 1804, to have been reduced to about 6 per cent.; and in 1805, to about 3 per cent., and subsequently to have suffered a still farther reduction.&#x2014;In the course of their investigation of the situation of the planters, your committee thought it right to ascertain whether it might not be in their own power, in many instances, to remedy the evils of their situation, by converting their sugar estates to other more profitable cultivation; but the evidence on that point shews, that such a conversion must be attended with so great a sacrifice of capital, as to be out of the question as a measure of relief.&#x2014;With a view to the prospect for the future, they have obtained a return of the quantity of sugar at present in the West-India docks; from which, and from other evidence, it appears, that the quantity now on hand is unusually great for the time of year. The crop of last year is also on the point of coming into the market.&#x2014;It should not be omitted further to state, that for many years past the islands have almost entirely escaped the natural calamities (of hurricanes, &amp;c.) which have oc
<image src="S1V0009P0I0690"/>
<col>lxxxiii</col>
casionally proved destructive to the property in those countries.&#x2014;In investigating the causes of that depression of the market, from whence the whole of the planter's distress appears to originate, the first object which strikes your committee, is, that extraordinary situation in which he is placed, which prevents him alone (in exception to every other similar case) from indemnifying himself for the increase of duty, and of other expenses attending his cultivation, by an equivalent increase of price to the consumer. For it appears, that since the year 1799, the duty on sugar has been raised from 20<i>s.</i> to 27<i>s.</i> and contingently to 30<i>s.</i> per cwt.; the expences of the estates are calculated to have risen in many articles 50, and in others above 100 per cent.; and the price has fallen from 69<i>s.</i> to 33<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per cwt. the average of the last eight months. As it appears obvious, from the above statement, that the duty is heavier than the article can bear at its present price, it is suggested that it might be expedient, for the reliet of the home market, to extend the principle which has been adopted on the contingent increase of duty from 27<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i>; so that from the maxmum of duty then fixed, on a gross price of 80<i>s.</i> affording 30<i>s.</i> duty and 50<i>s.</i> to the Planter, the duty should be thrown back on a similar scale in proportion to the depression of the market, till the price arrives at 60<i>s.</i> gross, leaving 20<i>s.</i> (the original duty) to government, and 40<i>s.</i> to the planter; or, in other words, a reduction of 2<i>s.</i> gross price, from the average then fixed for 1<i>s.</i> of duty on a reduction of the imposition of the new duty, as far as 20<i>s.</i>&#x2014;An increase of the bounty on the export has been also recommended; and your committee are of opinion, that it would afford great relief if given as an accompaniment to measures of restriction upon neutrals, so as to render the expences on British and foreign produce equal in the foreign market.&#x2014;A considerable depreciation in the price of rum having also taken place, it has been suggested, that the encouragement of the consumption of that article would be a considerable advantage to the planter. Your committee are aware that such encouragement has been given, to a certain extent, but if it were found practicable to carry that assistance further, by an increased consumption in the army and navy, such a measure would, in their opinion, have very beneficial effects; or a reduction of duty on rum might afford essential relief to the planter, without loss to the revenue, which would be indemnified by an increased consumption of that spirit.&#x2014;Great, how
<col>lxxxiv</col>
ever, as are the evils of the decrease of price and increase of charges, it does not appear to your committee, that they arc the original causes of the distress of the planter, by applying to which alone any practicable remedy, he could be more than partially relieved; but that the main evil and that to wh<ob/> h these are ultimately to be referred, is the very unfavourable state of the foreign market, in which formerly the British merchant enjoyed nearly a monopoly, but where he cannot at present enter into competition with the planters, not only of the neutral but of the hostile colonies. The result of all their enquiries on this most important part of the subject, has brought before their eyes one grand and primary evil, from which all the others are easily to be deduced; namely, the facility of intercourse between the hostile colonies of Europe, under the American neutral flag, by means of which not only the whole of their produce is carried to a market, but at charges little exceeding those of peace; while a British planter is burthened with all the inconvenience, risk, and expence, resulting from a state of war.&#x2014;The advantages which the hostile colonies derive from the relaxation of that principle, which prohibited any trade from being carried on with the enemy's colonies by neutrals during war, which the enemy himself did not permit to those neutrals during peace, may be in part estimated by reference to a statement of the imports into Amsterdam alone, from the United States of America, in the year 1806, amounting to 34,085 hhds. of coffee, and 45,097 hhds. of sugar, conveyed in 211 vessels, hereunto annexed; and to a statement also annexed, of the amount of West-India produce, exported from the United States of America, between the first of October 1805, and 30th of September 1806. In point of comparative expence, the advantages of the hostile colonies will be further illustrated by the evidence of Mr. Marryat, supported by satisfactory documents, which shew the charges of freight and insurance on sugar from the hostile colonies, through the United States of America to the ports of Holland and Flanders, and to those of the Mediterranean, to be less by 8<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> to the former, and by 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to the latter, than those charges on British sugars to the same ports.&#x2014;Your committee cannot omit to state also another important advantage enjoyed by the French colonies, from the sale of nearly the whole French mercantile marine to neutrals, under the stipulation of each vessel being returned into French ports, in order to be navigated as French ships, within
<image src="S1V0009P0I0691"/>
<col>lxxxv</col>
twelve months after peace, and With the enjoyment, during war, of the same privileges in the ports of France, as if they were actually French, for instance, to import Sugar at a duty of 4<i>s.</i> per cwt. less than the duty imposed on sugar imported in neutral vessels.&#x2014;In order to counterbalance, in some degree, the advantages thus enjoyed by the hostile colonies, to the detriment of the British planter, it has been recommended, that a blockade of the ports of the enemy's settlements should be resorted to; such a measure, if it could be strictly enforced, would undoubtedly afford relief to our export trade.&#x2014;But a measure of more permanent and certain advantage would be the enforcement of those restrictions on the trade between neutrals and the enemy's colonies, which were formerly maintained by Great Britain, and from the relaxation of Which the enemy's colo<ob/>es obtain indirectly, during war, all the advantages of peace; while our own colonies, in the intercourse with whom that system of monopoly which has been held essential to the commercial and military navy of this country, is rigorously enforced, are deprived of the advantages under which in former wars they carried their Produce to the foreign Markets, and which in the present war, by means of our decided naval superiority, would have amounted to the exclusive supply of the whole of Europe; and when those extraordinary Measures are taken into consideration which have been adopted to exclude the British colonial produce from the European market, it appears to your committee to be a matter of evident and imperious necessity, to resort to such a system as, by impeding and restricting, and as far as possible, preventing the export of the produce of the enemy's colonies from the places of its growth, shall compel the continent to have recourse to the only source of supply which, in that event, Would be open to it.&#x2014;As it may be apprehended that, from the adoption of such measures, difficulties might arise in that intercourse, from which the West Indies at present derive a considerable proportion of some of their supplies, your committee have thought it their duty to make enquiry into the resources in that respect to which recourse might be had in such an even<ob/>. During the only period which affords an example of the suspension of that intercourse, the evidence concurs as to the fact of a supply having been obtained though not Without temporary and occasional inconveniences) from a variety of sources which may reasonably be relied upon, in, case of such necessity, at the present
<col>lxxxvi</col>
moment, to a greater amount than at the former period. From the examination of persons Who, in consequence of their residence in the British North-American settlements, or extensive commercial connections with them, possess the best information as to their present and future resources, there is ground to believe that some supply of the principal articles of lumber might be obtained from thence immediately, and to expect that, with due encouragement, the quantity of that supply might be increased to any extent.&#x2014;The supply of flour which they could at present afford to the West-India market would be small, and of inferior quality. They appear to be capable of affording a large Supply of fish, and what deficiency might exist in other articles of salt provisions, might be made up by supplies from Europe.&#x2014;Upon the whole, the impression which your committee have received, is, that the trade now carried on between the British West Indies and the United States of America, is very convenient and advantageous to the inhabitants of our colonies, and one which they could not relinquish Without essential detriment, unless it were compensated by other advantages; but that it is not essential to their existence, or equivalent to the disadvantages of their situation, in those respects Which your committee have already gone through in the present statement.&#x2014;Your committee have briefly stated the distressed situation of the West-India planter&#x2014;the causes which have gradually produced his distress, which are beyond his reach to remedy, and which must continue to operate with increased effect&#x2014;and having stated such measures of relief as have been suggested to them, and such as, from the best sources of information, appear most adequate to the end in view, have only to add, that if those remedies are liable to objections and difficulties, there is, on the other hand, the strongest concurrent testimony and proof, that unless some speedy and efficient measures of relief are adopted, the ruin of a great number of the planters, and of persons in this country, holding annuities, and otherwise dependent upon those properties for their income, must inevitably very soon take place, which must be followed by the loss of a vast capital advanced on securities in those countries, and by the most fatal injury to the commercial, maritime, and financial interests of Great Britain.</p>
<p>SECOND REPORT, FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, &amp;C. OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.</p>

<col>lxxxvii</col>
<title>THE BANK OF ENGLAND.</title>
<p>The committee, appointed to examine and consider what Regulations and Checks have been established, in order to control the several branches of the Public Expenditure in Great Britain and Ireland; and how far the same have been effectual; and what further measures can be adopted for reducing any part of the said expenditure, or diminishing the amount of salaries and emoluments, without detriment to the public service;</p>
<p>DIRECTED their earliest enquiries to the management of the public debt, which the committee on finance in 1797, pointed out as the first object under the head of expenditure, in their XIVth report. The annual charge is of no inconsiderable magnitude; and the following observations are intended to shew how far it may admit of reduction.&#x2014;The rate of allowance settled in 1786, has not been varied since; but no documents are preserved at the treasury, or the bank, containing any calculations upon which it was founded. The proposal was made by Mr. Pitt, under general considerations of "the increased amount of the debt," and a reliance on the disposition of "the bank to give every reasonable accommodation to the public." The time at which the agreement was concluded, affording a prospect of continued peace, could present no expectation of a speedy augmentation of the debt, much less of such an augmentation as has since been incurred.&#x2014;Whatever may have been the computation upon which the bargain was concluded, it is to be observed that the lowest rate at which a part of the debt was then managed (being 360<i>l.</i> per million) was not adopted as the standard; and consequently, upon the annuities created in 1786, an inconsiderable increase of expense accrued in equalizing the whole, while upon every other part of the debt, a large saving was effected by reducing the allowance from 562<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> to 450<i>l.</i> for each million.&#x2014;The management of the public funds differs so materially in practice from all other mercantile or banking transactions, that it is not easy to establish a satisfactory criterion for fixing the commission at which so extensive and complicated a concern ought to be conducted; but there are two instances, the same in kind, and differing only in degree, which deserve attention, as they tend to throw some light upon the subject.&#x2014;The first of these is that of the South-sea company, which continues to manage its own portion of the debt according to the original allowances, the arrangements with the bank in 1786, not having been extended to this company, a cir
<col>lxxxvii</col>
cumstance which attracted the notice of the committee on finance, (XIV 11.) who remarked, that, "whether any further reduction can or ought to be made in this rate of allowance," was a point "for the wisdom of parliament to decide."&#x2014;Upon the part of the debt which forms the South-sea stock, the rate of charge is not uniform. The proportion of 582<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to each million, obtains with regard to the greater part, and the allowance upon the remainder bears the proportion of 562<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> to each million. The whole expense of managing this concern by the company was, in the year ending 5th January, 1807, 10,727<i>l.</i> of which 3,692<i>l.</i> was paid to the sub and deputy governors and directors, in number twenty-three, and 4,735<i>l.</i> to the clerks and officers, in number thirty-six. The sum annually paid by the public to the South-sea company, is 14,713<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and about 70<i>l.</i> more for fees and allowances to the cashier. The proportion which the salaries of the clerks bears to the whole expenditure deserves notice, and also the great number of the directors, almost equal to those who superintend the extensive business of the bank.&#x2014;The second example occurs in the more recent agreement made with the bank of Ireland, by statute 40 Geo. III. cap. 3. in which the precise allowances then and now given to the bank of England, were fixed as the standard for managing the Irish debt, though the debt of Ireland did not, in that year, equal the capital of the South-sea company, being between 21 and 22 millions.&#x2014;The management of the public debt in America may also afford some illustration of this subject, though it differs in one material respect, from the business transacted by the bank of England, inasmuch as the banks of the United States undertake merely the payment of the dividends, the transfers being made at the public offices of the government. Upon this account, and from the limited number of stockholders (who do not exceed 15,000) their trouble, expense, and risk, scarcely admit of comparison with the bank of England. The American banks transact this business free of all expense to the government; the balances left in their hands, which are used for their advantage (like those deposited with any private banker) being considered as a sufficient compensation.&#x2014;Assuming as an incontrovertible proposition, applicable to all mercantile concerns, that, in proportion as the scale of business becomes enlarged, the rate of Commission may be reduced, and that a moderate commission upon a large business produces a greater proportionate profit than a higher rate upon one
<image src="S1V0009P0I0693"/>
<col>lxxxix</col>
more confined, it is obvious that a charge of allowance, which may be reasonable upon 20 or 25 millions, becomes profuse and extravagant upon 5 or 6 hundred millions.&#x2014;The actual progress of the debt comes next to be considered, which, on the 5th January, 1786, was 224,102,424<i>l.</i> and the charges of management were then (according to the reduced scale of allowances) 100,846<i>l.</i> On the 5th of January, 1797, the year in which the committee on finance reported, the principal of debt unredeemed was 272,892,444<i>l.</i>, the charges of management upon which, so far as concerned the bank, were 115,543<i>l.</i>&#x2014;On the 5th of January, 1800, the year of the renewal of the charter, the principal of debt unredeemed was 376,185,801<i>l.</i> and the charges of management, received by the bank, were 170,053<i>l.</i>&#x2014;The debt unredeemed on the 5th of January 1807, was 550,441,314<i>l.</i> and the charges of management, received by the bank, were 265,818<i>l.</i> to which must be added 5,687<i>l.</i> on account of the Austrian loan, according to the same rate of commission. The allowance of 4000<i>l.</i> towards the expences of the house, and also the original allowance of 1,898<i>l.</i> on 4,000,000<i>l.</i> purchased from the South-sea company, are in addition to the before mentioned sums. The increase in the establishment of the bank, which has been rendered necessary by the progressive augmentation of this branch of their business, consists principally in a large addition to the number of clerks; of whom the whole number employed in the public business, exclusively, or principally, was, in 1786, 243; in 1796, 313; and in 1807, 450; whose salaries, it is presumed, may be calculated, at an average, at between 120<i>l.</i> and 170<i>l.</i> for each clerk; taking them at 135<i>l.</i>, which exceeds the average of those employed in the South-sea house, the sum is,

either of which two last sums would probably be sufficient to provide a superannuation fund. The very moderate salaries received by the governor, deputy governor, and directors, amount to between 7 and 8,000<i>l.</i>; and only a part of these must be considered as compensation for the trouble of superintending the public business.

&#x2014;Without being too minute in endeavouring to calculate what increase may have
<col>xc</col>
taken place in these last articles, of which the bank do not keep any distinct account, it is to be noticed that the whole increase of the officers who actually transact the business, in the last eleven years, is only 137, whose annual. expence may be from 18,449<i>l.</i> to 23,290<i>l.</i>; the addition to the other permanent charges being probably about one-half, or two thirds of that sum; but that the additional allowance for management in the last ten years, is more than 155,000<i>l.</i> This general conjectural estimate of the expences actually incurred by the bank exhibits, if it be near the truth, the charge which would have attended the management of this business by government, if, previous to the arrangement which took place in 1786, it had been thought advisable to adopt the suggestion, formerly made by the auditors of public accounts, when this whole matter was referred to them by the treasury.&#x2014;Their report, already printed in XIV. 30. well deserves the consideration of the house; and particularly the estimate they formed of the real value of the service, which they supposed might be executed at less than one third of the charge at that time incurred, that is, at a rate of allowance under 187<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> for each million, when the debt was no larger than has been before stated.&#x2014;Your committee, however they may approve the general principle of the reasoning contained in that report, are far from thinking that such a transfer of management would have been expedient, or desirable in itself, being of opinion that the debt can be managed no where more commodiously, and that it ought no where to be managed so cheaply, as at the bank.&#x2014;The committee on finance so far agreed with the auditors of the public accounts, as to intimate an opinion in favour of the reduction of the existing rate of allowance for managing the public debt. They state "that the bank, over and above the charges of managemen<ob/>, are accustomed to receive allowances from public, at the rate of 805<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per million, for receiving contributions for loans; and 1000<i>l.</i> or sometimes more, for contributions to the lottery; and that they have the benefit of holding all the money for half-yearly dividends, besides having the custody of cash for the navy and army services.&#x2014;Upon reviewing therefore these circumstances in the present times (1797), and without questioning the propriety of the arrangement made in 1786, when the public debt was so much inferior in amount, your committee cannot forbear to state it as a question still deserving the attention of parliament, whether a further re

<col>xci</col>
duction of expence cannot, and ought not, to be made upon this branch of public expenditure?"&#x2014;Besides the management of the debt, the bank have large transactions with the public, affording a considerable profit to the corporation; into the nature and amount of which, for the purpose of laying the whole matter before the house, it is proper to enter.&#x2014;The amount of the several balances of public money, lying in their hands, are first to be stated:

<td>Your committee are aware, that in thus exhibiting average balances of cash in the bank, instead of the several actual balances, they may possibly be considered as presenting an unfair view of the subject; but it must be observed, that however fluctuating many of the individual balances may be, the aggregate is never likely to vary materially; and that in particular, if the balances of exchequer money, which are moderate in the early part of each quarter, and extremely large towards the conclusion of it, are compared with the balances of the commissioners for the sinking fund, and those on account of unpaid dividends, both of which are large in the beginning of each quarter. and small towards the <ob/>nd, the aggregate sum under these principal heads will be found to furnish a stationary balance of a most important amount. The documents from the bank, and the exchequer, which could conveniently be furnished, do not afford an exact statement of the whole actual balance of public money in the hands of the bank, on any great number of separate and given days; they, however, give the following results, viz. that on the 11th of October, 1806, the time immediately preceding the payment of the dividends, the sum in the hands of the bank, under the first mentioned head, of customs, &amp;c. was</td>

<p>The excess of the actual balances of this period above the average balances before stated, arises from the circumstance of its having been thought proper, in stating those average balances, to form the estimate of the average cash in the exchequer from an account of the whole year.&#x2014;The magnitude of these balances, and of the profit which must be derived from them (a profit which is likely to increase during the war, but which may be subject to diminution on the return of peace) had attracted the attention of your committee no less than that of the allowance for the management of the national debt. The annual interest calculated upon them amounts to between 5 and 600,000<i>l.</i> In the case of a private banker, floating balances cannot be considered as productive of a profit equal, or nearly equal, to the whole interest upon them; because, both the charges of the management of the concern, and the interest lost by maintaining the stock of ready money deemed necessary for securing the punctuality of current payments, operate largely in diminution of such profit; but in the case of the bank of England, the charges belonging to their banking transactions with government must evidently be small in comparison with the profit of those extensive transactions. The aggregate balances of public money, in the hands of the bank, have been shewn to admit of no great fluctuations; nor do they require to be provided for (especially at the present period) by means of a stock of unproductive money, the
<image src="S1V0009P0I0696"/>
<col>xcv</col>
notes of the bank itself being employed to meet any such occasion.&#x2014;Your committee therefore are inclined to consider a sum equal to 5 percent. interest, on the average balances in question, to be not far from the amount of the profits arising from this source. These profits undoubtedly are intermixed with the other profits of the bank, but their general amount may, without difficulty, be distinguished and ascertained. Excepting the sum gained by the management of the public debt, and of loans and lotteries, and by trade in bullion, the whole gain of the bank must obviously consist of interest on various sums lent; and the amount of the daily interest so accruing, must necessarily bear an exact proportion to the total daily amount of the several funds in their hands, deduction being made for that part only, which is kept invested in cash and bullion, these being the only unproductive articles of any moment in which their funds can be employed. But as some doubts may be excited by the annexed evidence, respecting the productive quality of some of these balances, it seems proper to enter fully into the subject; in doing which, the circumstances which accompany and follow each augmentation of the government balances, must be minutely detailed.&#x2014;Whenever an addition is made to the amount of these balances, it is effected in general by a payment into the bank of their own notes. The notes so paid in are cancelled. Thus a reduction takes place in the circulating notes, and these notes are a fund, which supplies, in the same manner as the government balances, the means of lending at interest. Every such reduction of notes, however, must be considered as temporary, because the maintenance of the circulating bank paper at the accustomed, or nearly the accustomed point, is felt by the bankers and merchants of the metropolis to be necessary to the regularity of current payments. Bills of exchange are therefore offered to the bank to be discounted, in such quantity as to restore the amount or nearly the amount of notes cancelled by means of any increase of balances, unless the bank itself, by delivering out notes in payment for exchequer bills which they may have bought, or for loans to government, should have rendered the application for additional discounts unnecessary. This application for additional discounts, on the occasion of an increase of balances, must indeed ordinarily precede such increase, and furnish the means of effecting it.&#x2014;That the great augmentation of government balances in the bank, which has taken place since the year 1797, (an augmen
<col>xcvi</col>
tation amounting probably to seven or eight millions,) has not permanently diminished the notes in circulation, is proved by the annexed account of notes in circulation between the 7th of February, 1795, and the 1st of February, 1807, by which it appears that the notes, exclusive of 1 and 2 pound notes, were,

The fluctuation in those 12 years (with the exception of a short period preceding the suspension of the cash payments) was only between the sums of 11,589,380<i>l.</i> and 13,845,800<i>l.</i> to which last-mentioned sum they amounted on the 25th of January, 1801, a period not long subsequent to the day of paying the dividends, when a more than ordinary issue of paper must be supposed to have taken place. Since therefore each augmentation of the government balances, though it may be at first attended by a diminution of bank paper, is followed by a proportionate re-issue of that paper, and since, in return for the paper so re-issued, additional bills are discounted, additional exchequer bills are bought, or additional loans are furnished to government, (all articles equally yielding interest.) it follows that those additions which are made to the balances must be considered as producing a corresponding increase of interest. The proportion will be exact, whenever the notes suppressed are exactly restored, provided the quantity of cash and bullion continues precisely the same.&#x2014;Whether the cash and bullion in the bank have been augmented since the same period of 1797, and, if augmented, whether in a material degree, on the ground of the increased magnitude of the balances due from the bank to the government, is a question into which your committee cannot, from want of documents, particularly enter. They conceive, however, that if an augmentation of the cash and bullion be admitted, it must be considered as principally intended to meet any demand to which the bank may be exposed by its circulating paper, and especially as a provision for the payment of their one and two pound notes, the circulation of which may cease whenever the bank shall have resumed its payments in cash.&#x2014;In the evidence upon this part of the subject, it is admitted, that the notes of the bank are productive of profit: but it appears to be assumed, that the government balances are only so in proportion as they tend to augment the amount of notes; whereas your committee are fully
<image src="S1V0009P0I0697"/>
<col>xcvii</col>
persuaded that both balances and notes, are and must necessarily be, productive.&#x2014;The funds of the bank, which are the sources of profit, and which constitute the measure of the sum they have to lend, (subject only to a deduction on account of cash and bullion,) may be classed under three heads.&#x2014;First, the sum receive from their proprietors as capital, together with the savings which have been added to it.&#x2014;Secondly, the sum received from persons keeping cash at the bank. This sum consists of the balances on the deposit accounts both of government and of individuals. In 1797, this fund, including all the balances of individuals, was only 5,130,140<i>l.</i> The present government balances alone have been already stated at between eleven and twelve millions, including bank-notes deposited in the exchequer.&#x2014;Thirdly, the sum received in return for notes put into circulation. A corresponding value for every note must originally have been given, and the value thus given for notes constitutes one part of the general fund to be lent at interest. A note-holder, indeed, does not differ essentially from a person to whom a balance is due. Both are creditors of the bank, the one holding a note which is the evidence of the debt due to him, the other having the evidence of an entry in the ledger of the bank. The sum at all times running at interest will be in exact proportion to the amount of these three funds combined, deduction being made for the value of cash and bullion.&#x2014;Under the three heads above mentioned, first, of capital and savings; secondly, balances or deposit accounts; and thirdly, notes in circulation; all the sums are stated which the bank would have to discharge in the event of the winding up of their affairs; and they must of course have assets sufficient and available for this purpose, which assets can only consist of cash and bullion, and securities for money lent.&#x2014;In whatever degree therefore any one of the three first mentioned items, namely, capital, deposits, or notes, increase, the other two remaining fixed, in the same degree must the sum running at interest increase, provided the cash and bullion do not vary; and this adaptation of the sum at interest to the amount of the balances, may be presumed to take place without any particular cognizance of the subject by the directors, who make a profitable use of the balances, by consenting so far to satisfy the current demands for discount, or by making such loans to government, or buying such number of exchequer bills, or other securities, as may suffice to maintain in circulation the accustomed quantity of notes.
<col>xcviii</col>
&#x2014;It is impossible therefore to admit, that the bank have no means of placing out at interest the whole of the large sums which constitute the government balances. Those balances are lent at interest, because a demand for loans to this extent cannot fail to arise out of the natural demand for the accustomed quantity of notes. The bank have no property of any moment lying dead, cash and bullion excepted; they possess indeed property in buildings, but these are stated in the evidence to have been paid for as they were erected, out of their current profits, and constitute no article in their accounts. Unless, therefore, they have a sum at interest applicable, together with the cash and bullion, to the purpose of answering the demands of those who have deposits in their hands, they have not assets necessary to satisfy the three classes of claimants which have been mentioned.&#x2014;Your committee cannot allow the validity of an argument which is to be found in the evidence, against the profit derived from the balances, that the bank do not wish to enlarge the scale of their business, and that it is their custom to suppress, rather than encourage, the demand for their notes, nor can it be admitted as a general proposition, that their notes form the criterion of their profits. Since these balances are placed in their hands without interest, and are then lent out at interest, they must unquestionably be considered as enlarging the scale, not merely of their business, but of their profits. That the amount of notes is one criterion, and is a most important source of their profits, is undoubtedly true, but it is equally true that the amount of balances is another; and although the careful limitation of the circulating paper is an act of prudence, the balances cannot be considered as affected by such limitation; nor can it be inferred, from the propriety of limiting the paper, that there exists any similar occasion for restricting the other branches of the business of the bank.</p>

<p>This debit side of the account exhibited the total sum due both to the bank, proprietors
<image src="S1V0009P0I0698"/>
<col>xcix</col>
and others on the 25th of February, 1797, with the exception of 11,686,800<i>l.</i> capital lent to government, which was adverted to only at the foot of the statement. The credit side of the account enumerated the effects (amounting to the same sum of 17,597,280<i>l.</i>) applicable to the payment of that debt.&#x2014;These assets were stated to consist of "advances on government securities," viz. on "land and malt," on "exchequer bills, &amp;c." "bills discounted, &amp;c." and "cash and bullion." Supposing therefore the amount of surplus capital and bank notes on the debit side, and the cash and bullion on the credit side, to continue stationary, the amount of the other articles on the credit side (all of them articles producing interest), must necessarily fluctuate in exact correspondence with every fluctuation of the deposits; and in case another statement, formed in the same manner as that presented in 1897, were now to be made out, the sum of 8,640,250<i>l.</i> of notes having been augmented to 16,621,390<i>l.</i> and the sum of 5,130,000<i>l.</i> of deposits having risen probably to about 13 or 14 millions, there would unquestionably be an increase of about 16 or 17 millions running at interest to be stated on the other side, deducting whatever may have been added to the cash and bullion since February 1797.&#x2014;The annual and temporary bonus of five per cent. which the bank have for some successive years added to their accustomed dividends of seven per cent. and the recent augmentation of their regular dividends to ten per cent. exclusive of property tax; the rise also of the market price of their stock, which having sold in 1800 from 156<i>l.</i> to 172<i>l.</i> per cent. now sells at 230<i>l.</i> are strong circumstances in confirmation of the large increase of their profits. This increase cannot be accounted for by any material augmentation of the advantages derived from the management of their own capital, nor from that part of their business which they transact as bankers to individuals, (a part indeed at all times comparatively small in its amount); for although the number of persons having accounts open with the bank, has been lately much increased, the floating balances on those accounts are known to be in general very small, most of the accounts being kept open only for the sake of the opportunity which they afford of borrowing in the way of discount. The extension either of loans to government, or of discount to the merchants, or of both, is the necessary effect of the augmentation of the government deposits, and it is to the largeness of these deposits that the increased profits ought to be referred.&#x2014;The gain which the bank have de
<col>c</col>
rived from the issue of one and two pound notes, amounting to 4,287,960<i>l.</i> on the 1st of February last, may be expected to cease whenever the payment of cash shall have been resumed.&#x2014;The next point to be considered is whether any of the public balances may safely admit of diminution? Those under the first head, namely, the balances which are lodged in the bank by officers in the receipt of revenue, which make weekly payments of their cash into the exchequer, evidently admit of no reduction.&#x2014;Some few of the balances under the second head, which belong to offices of large expenditure, may perhaps be diminished by the more careful application of an economical principle lately introduced, that of occasionally furnishing to the heads of certain offices, exchequer bills instead of money, which bills are sold in the market in the quantities and at the times which the immediate occasions of the office require, and therefore diminish the necessity of maintaining large balances in cash.&#x2014;The balances in the bank, under the third head, of unclaimed dividends, appear to your committee to admit of reduction. These balances have been already represented as less by 376,739<i>l.</i> than the gross amount at which they are given by the bank, because, in consequence of the act passed in 1791, c. 33, that sum remains in the possession of the public, out of the 500,000<i>l.</i> advanced nominally by the bank, but really taken out of the unclaimed dividends, which were then, for the first time, brought under the notice of parliament and made applicable to the public service. It seems to have been an unintentional omission in framing that statute, that no provision was made for making up deficiencies to the public, as well as to the bank, whenever the whole sum of such unclaimed dividends might rise above, as well as whenever it should fall below the stipulated amount of 600,000<i>l.</i>; and if it should be judged expedient to continue and pursue the principle of that act, it should be amended with a view to this object; and the usual amount of unclaimed dividends being ascertained, it may be fit to apply to the public service according to the same regulations, whatever may probably be the surplus above the 100,000<i>l.</i> which was intended at all times to remain in the bank. The sum, which, on the score of those dividends, may be now applied to the public service, is certainly not less than 428,261<i>l.</i> in addition to the 376,739<i>l.</i> making in all 800,000<i>l.</i> The unclaimed dividends in the hands of the bank, amounted at that period of the year 1806, at which they were the lowest, namely, on the 8th of July, to
<image src="S1V0009P0I0699"/>
<col>ci</col>
986,573<i>l.</i> and at the lowest period of some antecedent years, they have not fallen below 900,000<i>l.</i> The following mode of diminishing the cash balances under the fourth head (of the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt), and under the fifth head (of exchequer money), has suggested itself to your committee.&#x2014;A large part of the sum in the exchequer is destined to be paid on the four quarter-days to the commissioners for reducing the national debt, for dividends on redeemed debt standing in their names, and for sinking fund; and the sum so received by the commissioners (amounting now to above two millions
quarterly), is employed in the purchase of stock in equal portions on all the transfer days of the succeeding quarter. It seems expedient, that to a portion of this sum an economical principle should be applied, It may be inferred from the paper inserted in the appendix, and from the annexed evidence, that by the middle of each quarter a sum of more than one million is always nominally in the exchequer, and actually in the Bank, which is applicable at the end of the quarter to the purpose of paying the sum then due to the commissioners for reducing the national debt. Your committe, therefore, recommend that the sum of about one million should be issued in the middle of the next, or of some subsequent quarter, to the commissioners, to be applied by them to the object of buying up stock in the course of some succeeding months, in addition to the regular and accustomed purchases. The means of carrying on the regular purchases will be furnished by issuing to the commissioners, on the quarter-day subsequent to the issue of the million, a sum less by one million than that which would have been paid to them according to the accustomed course, and by issuing a further million six weeks after that quarter-day, by which time the exchequer will be able to supply it. Assuming that the same mode of issuing all sums due to the commissioners at half-quarterly, instead of quarterly periods, may continue, the effect of the proposed measure will be to give, in the year in which it is to take place, a clear million sterling to the sinking fund, by the application of which, in that year, annuities amounting to nearly 500,000<i>l.</i> per annum may be bought up, the other operations of the sinking fund continuing precisely as before. In consequence of the application of this extra million to the extinction of debt, there must be a reduction of one million in all future balances of the exchequer money in the bank, during the last six weeks of every

quarter, and a similar reduction in the future balances of the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt lodged in the bank during the first six weeks of every quarter. A reduction to this extent is practicable at present, and a further reduction may, on similar principles, be made at any future period, when the increased amount of the sinking fund, and of the balances of cash in the hands of the commissioners, shall afford similar reasons for repeating the same operation. By this anticipation, the exchequer money destined to pay the sum due to the commissioners of the sinking fund, would n<ob/> be diverted from its original purpose, but a portion of it would be applied somewhat earlier to that very object, and in addition to the original sum, and the public creditor must unquestionably be benefited by such an augmentation of the sinking fund.&#x2014;If the preceding proposition should be deemed liable to objection on account of the preference, so far as respects one million, which is proposed o be given to the commissioners for the sinking fund, over the general body of stockholders, the objection may be removed, by giving to the stockholders a preference to which they are not now entitled, as a compensation, empowering them to receive on the quarter-day the whole of their dividends on stock, antecedently to the issue of any dividends on the stock of the commissioners.&#x2014;Such being the general state of the connection between the public and the bank, it becomes an object of consideration, in the last place, what have been the transactions between them since the year 1786? These are, first, the statute of 1791; secondly, the renewal of the charter in 1800; and thirdly, the agreement for the loan of 3,000,000<i>l.</i> in 1806.&#x2014;First, The act of 1791, c. 33, authorized the bank to advance 500,000<i>l.</i> without interest, for the service of the public, which came in fact, as has been already explained, out of the unclaimed dividends, but in consequence of the second clause for repayment, in case of a deficiency, the sum remaining in the hands of the public, is not more than, 376,739<i>l.</i> there being no provision for increasing it after the diminution had once taken place. It was a further enactment of this statute, that the allowance for managing the debt should continue at the rate of 450<i>l.</i> per million; and it is observable, that this is the only statute which contains any distinct stipulation upon that point.&#x2014;The committee on Finance in 1797 distinguished the debt created subsequent to 1791, from that which is within the obligation of this act,
<image src="S1V0009P0I0700"/>
<col>ciii</col>
remarking expressly, that "Since that year the case is different, and no such stipulations exist. All the subsequent loan acts, and those for funding exchequer, navy, and victualling bills, have left the contract open, reserving a power to the treasury to make any such compensation as should be reasonable."&#x2014;Secondly, by the act 40 Geo. III. c. 28. the bank charter was continued until 1st August 1833, on condition of three millions being advanced for the public service, without interest for six years ending 5th April 1806: the sole right of banking as a corporate body, and the other privileges, are fully recited and confirmed; but nothing is expressly stipulated with regard to the rate of allowance for managing the debt.&#x2014;The circumstances attending this negociation are related in the evidence of Mr. Thornton, who was at that time governor of the bank, and from whom the suggestion of renewing the charter originally came. He states, that the various sources from which the bank derive profit, in consequence of their exclusive privilege, and of their connexion with government, were enumerated by Mr. Pitt, who made a claim on the part of the public for a direct participation in the profits, according to a fixed proportion; and that the claim, though not admitted in its full extent by himself on the part of the company, was ultimately agreed to; that a calculation was formed upon the basis of such participation; and that the interest of three millions, for six years, was given to the public as the fair result. The authority therefore of Mr. Pitt, and the consent of the then governor of the bank, established a general principle of participation in those profits of the bank, which arise from their exclusive privilege, and from the balances of public money in their hands, and whether the participation be supposed to be in the fixed proportion of 1&#x2013;4 1&#x2013;3 or 1&#x2013;2, it cannot fail to be extremely considerable. In one of the conversations upon this subject, it appears to have been distinctly assumed on one side, and to have been admitted on the other, that the government balances in the bank which were drawn from the exchequer (estimated then by Mr. Pitt, as they nearly were, at two millions and a half on an average), and the growing balances of the commissioners for the sinking fund, were productive of profit, and an expectation is said to have been given, that they should not be withdrawn from the bank without compensation. The productive quality of some of the government balances being admitted, it is not easy to conceive that the bank have any method, except
<col>civ</col>
that of increasing their cash and bullion, of preventing the productive quality of the same balances when enlarged to the extent that they now are, or of other balances which have been added. The circumstance of the bank gaining a profit by the management of the public debt, appears to have been in some degree adverted to; but the propriety of the rate of allowance then subsisting did not come particularly under consideration. The documents necessary to form a correct opinion upon the complicated concerns of this extensive business, were probably not fully before either of the two parties at the time of this agreement; it is obvious, that they cannot be collected without considerable and detailed investigation, nor digested without industry and attention; and the pressure of other duties may well account for a want of leisure for so laborious a research at the period of the renewal of the charter. The other balances of public money do not appear to have entered into Mr. Pitt's calculation, as they were at that time of trifling amount, and the probability of any such increase as has actually taken place in the balances drawn from the exchequer, in consequence of the great augmentation of revenue (an increase from an average sum of 2&#x00BD; millions to an average sum of five or six millions) was not adverted to, and can hardly be supposed to have been in contemplation. Supposing all the suggestions which your committee have made with a view of diminishing the balances in the bank to be adopted, the amount of balances still remaining will probably more than double the amount of those which existed in 1800, or which could then be contemplated as likely to exist at this time; and therefore, if the intention of Mr. Pitt not to withdraw the balances of exchequer money, or those arising from the accumulation of the then existing sinking fund, without compensation, should be adhered to, that intention will not be frustrated, the unexpected enlargement of the same balances, and the addition of so many others, forming much more than compensation in question. Thirdly, the last agreement with the bank which it will be necessary to notice, was in 1806, 46 Geo. III. c. 41. when the three millions, which ought to have been repaid on the 5th of April, were continued as a loan to the public until six months after the ratification of a definitive treaty of peace, at an interest of 3<i>l.</i> per cent. which is to be considered as a gift of 60,000<i>l.</i> per annum, so long as the war continues. Whether this bargain was concluded upon an examination sufficiently comprehensive of the general si
<image src="S1V0009P0I0701"/>
<col>cv</col>
tuation of the bank, is not now the question; but the transaction is most material in another view, as it evinces that the agreement made in 1800, was not considered either by those who acted upon the part of the public, nor by the bank directors themselves, as a bar against further participation, whenever the increase of their profits derived from the public, and the circumstances of public affairs, might, upon similar principles, make such a claim reasonable and expedient. After a summary recapitulation of the advantages which the bank derive from their charter, and from their connection with the public, it will be proper to enumerate the benefits which the public receive from them in return. 1st, A large profit on the management of the public debt is enjoyed by the bank; and, 2dly, the interest arising from between 11 and 12 millions of government balances lying in their hands. 3dly, They have whatever profit is to be derived from their paper circulation, amounting to 16,621,390<i>l.</i> the issue of which results from the exclusive powers given to them by their charter. It may be remarked, however, that it is a circulation of which they carefully limit the amount, and on account of which, as well as with a view to the general demands of the state, they are subject to the burthen of ordinarily maintaining a large stock of cash a and bullion, and of providing, except during the suspension of payments in cash, all the gold and silver used for the coinage of money. The advantages which government, on the part of the public, receives in return, are the following: 1st,&#x2014;The capital (11,686,000<i>l.</i>) of the bank is lent to the public at the rate of 3<i>l.</i> per cent. The benefit derived from this loan, amounting at present to 233,720<i>l.</i> is not stated in the annexed evidence, as having been particularly adverted to in the conversations which took place between Mr. Pitt and the governor of the bank, on the occasion of the renewal of the charter, but the continuance of this benefit to the public is secured by the act. 2d,&#x2014;Advances are made to the extent of 2,750,000<i>l.</i> upon the annual land and malt taxes, or the duties substituted, at an interest of 4<i>l.</i> per cent. The established custom of lending to this extent, at a moderate interest, must undoubtedly
<col>cvi</col>
be considered as an intended compensation in part for the benefit which the bank derive from the use of public money. 3d,&#x2014;A sum of three millions was lent to government, as has been already stated, without interest, for six years from 1800, as the price of the renewal of the bank charter; and it was agreed in 1806, that the same should be sent at 3<i>l.</i> per cent. during the continuance of the war. Another direct advantage derived to the public consists in the receipt at the bank, of the property tax upon the dividends, and the prompt payment of it into the exchequer, without charge, or extra allowance; by which means all delay is obviated in the collection of a large portion of the war taxes, and the expence of officers is saved. The stock transferred to the commissioners for reducing the national debt, and on account of the redemption of land-tax, is not charged by the bank with any allowance for management; which two sums amount to about 184,000,000<i>l.</i> exclusive of South-Sea annuities. The practice of making advances upon certain instalments of the public loans, on the security of the receipts, is a considerable accommodation to the subscribers, and enables government to contract for loans upon terms somewhat more advantageous than could be done if that facility were not afforded. The Bank, however, receive in return the legal rate of interest, as they do also upon all transactions with the government, except those already stated. The accommodations derived by the public from its connexion with the bank, have been carried, in some years, to a very large amount; and it must always be considered as an object of the greatest consequence to maintain the permanence of an establishment of such opulence and credit, which, by the judicious conduct of its own affairs, has contributed so materially to extend the commercial prosperity, and to maintain the public faith of the country. Your committee cannot conclude their report without bearing testimony to the favourable disposition so often manifested on the part of the bank towards the public service; and they entertain no doubt of the same readiness to accede to any equitable arrangement that may be proposed under the present circumstances.</p>
