                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister that they wish to
                make a statement on the reinvestment and reform initiative.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the statement is being
                photocopied now. It should be available shortly. I hope that
                copies can be distributed to Members while the Deputy First
                Minister and I are speaking, rather than being left outside the
                Chamber. The Deputy First Minister would also like a copy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With permission, the Deputy First Minister
                and I would like to make a statement on how we are starting to
                implement the reinvestment and reform initiative. Through this
                first phase of the initiative we can target £200 million on key
                aspects of the infrastructure of Northern Ireland. We are adding
                a further £70 million to that sum from the infrastructure
                Executive programme fund. Over the next two years that
                unprecedented package will significantly accelerate major
                investment. In key areas we will start to address the investment
                deficit that developed under direct rule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we launched the reinvestment and reform
                initiative on 2 May 2002, we explained that this was the reason
                that we had secured a unique package of measures through
                negotiations with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. Our
                purpose was clear. Only if we can address the basic
                infrastructure can we provide the quality of services that a
                vibrant economy and a fair society needs. Only with
                well-designed hospitals can well-trained doctors and nurses
                provide the quality of care that is needed. Only if there is an
                end to poor-quality classrooms can we provide the environment
                for good-quality teaching and learning. Only when crumbling or
                inadequate water and sewerage systems are replaced can we be
                confident that Northern Ireland has safe water and a clean
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need to improve our infrastructure unites
                all Assembly parties and all our people. We agree that improved
                infrastructure means improved public services and improved
                conditions for economic growth. That aim is at the core of the
                Programme for Government and has been central to our approach
                from the outset.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive introduced the Executive
                programme fund for infrastructure and capital renewal with that
                very purpose in mind. We decided from the outset that we had to
                protect a significant part of the Budget specifically for
                investment. Over successive Budgets we have sought to increase
                allocations in that area, seeking to start gradually to turn the
                tanker of public expenditure in the right direction. We
                realised, however, that to achieve our ambitions for new
                investment we had to find ways of doing and thinking outside the
                traditional box.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A step change in investment must be
                accompanied by a radical reappraisal of the problem and a search
                for new solutions. That is why, in the first phase of
                devolution, we embarked on a series of related reviews to enable
                us to set a new strategic approach to the financing and delivery
                of public services. The rating system is undergoing a
                fundamental examination, and alternative sources of funding are
                being considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, through the review of
                public administration, we want a thorough review of the
                structures for service delivery. That is why we have set in
                train the most wide-ranging review of the needs and
                effectiveness of the main expenditure programmes that has ever
                been conducted in Northern Ireland. It will be the focus of
                debate in the Executive in the coming weeks. We hope that the
                evaluations will also play a central role in the Assembly’s
                consideration of the next Budget and Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short, there are four key aspects to the
                Executive’s search for improved public services: alternative
                sources of finance; rating policy; public administration; and
                the needs and effectiveness studies. Their common aim is to
                enable us to provide high-quality public services and enhanced
                public assets. Some will take time; others can, and should,
                proceed sooner, as it is clear that early action is needed. It
                is essential to have a clear strategy and to make a start. The
                reinvestment and reform initiative lets us make much more
                substantial progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 7 May we set out the core elements of the
                initiative for the Assembly and explained that £200 million
                would be available for investment over the next two years, to
                which we have now added £70 million from the infrastructure
                Executive programme fund. There will also be a new borrowing
                power for the longer term, the transfer of some strategic
                military and security assets, the creation of a new strategic
                investment body and a major programme of public-sector reform to
                secure greater expertise and effectiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are announcing the detail of the first
                element of the initiative today. The initiative is an integrated
                one, so before we describe the allocations in detail, I will
                remind Members of the key aspects. An Executive subcommittee has
                been established to oversee the initiative to ensure that the
                reform is effectively co-ordinated. Central to it is a new
                mechanism to help individual Ministers, and the Executive as a
                whole, to plan the organisation and financing of the new capital
                investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new strategic investment body, which
                draws together expertise in finance and project planning and
                delivery from the public and private sectors, will be the
                central resource to drive through a new way of doing public
                business. Its mission will be to ensure that strategic
                infrastructure is much more effectively planned and delivered
                than before, using all available resources and means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much work will be needed to plan and resource
                the strategic investment body, and progress has been made. A
                project board has been established, whose members were nominated
                by all four parties in the Executive, to advise on the remit and
                status of the body. It has already met three times and will make
                progress over the coming months. It has already examined the
                approach taken to those issues in London and Dublin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister and I have also
                agreed to exchange information and experience on private finance
                initiatives and public-private partnerships (PPPs) with the
                Scottish Executive. We want to be innovative and work out an
                approach that fits our unique context. However, we have been
                glad of the opportunities to learn from progress made elsewhere
                so that we avoid reinventing when we want to be reinvesting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions are continuing with the Ministry
                of Defence and the Northern Ireland Office on the transfer of
                sites. Work on developing proposals for the major Ebrington site
                has begun already. The Deputy First Minister and I have
                established a partnership and regeneration panel that will
                involve central and local government and the community and
                business sectors to develop proposals for the Executive’s
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local experience and expertise will advise
                the Executive on how best to use this strategically important
                asset. Community and business groups will also be consulted and
                involved in developing ideas for the use of the other sites
                through an approach of not just joined-up but joined-in
                government. We shall discuss shortly with the relevant Ministers
                the best legal and administrative framework for realising the
                potential of the strategic sites. Thinking outside the box
                secured the sites for the Executive; thinking outside the box
                will maximise their benefit to all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initiative is about reform. We cannot
                invest in infrastructure if we do not improve service delivery
                continually. To do otherwise would be to complete only half of
                the job. Major initiatives, such as the review of public
                administration, will help us to drive change at a high level.
                So, too, will our use of public service agreements and service
                delivery agreements, which will put a spotlight on what we get
                for our resources. Central to that will be the strategic
                investment body, which will advise us on the best and most
                efficient use of resources. However, we expect Ministers to
                ensure reform in their Departments and agencies alongside the
                investment that we announce today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this statement, we want to focus on the
                short-term element of the package. From the beginning of our
                discussions with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, we said
                that we had to make an early start. Now, just two months after
                the initial launch, the Executive have decided what should be
                done over the next two years. In preparing the package of
                measures, we built on proposals identified by Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Originally, we invited bids for allocations
                out of the infrastructure element of the Executive programme
                funds. After the announcement of the reinvestment and reform
                initiative, we asked Departments for further ideas for action in
                the short term. We made it clear that those should address some
                of our most urgent infrastructure needs, but without pre-empting
                the role of the strategic investment body. Details of the 29
                programmes or projects that the Executive support are set out in
                the table attached to the copies of our statement which, I hope,
                have been provided for Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A list of further projects will be identified
                for consideration by the Executive in the autumn, taking account
                of the advice of the project board for the strategic investment
                body. We are, however, committing ourselves to an approach
                through the reinvestment and reform initiative, which will
                systematically address our problems in a clear, integrated and
                transparent way. Many needs cannot be met today, such is the
                extent of the backlog faced by society, and Committees will be
                aware of other proposals that Departments have lodged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total value of the projects and
                programmes that are contained, wholly or in part, in the package
                is £510 million, including contributions from private funds and
                the mainstream departmental budgets. The new money committed by
                the Executive in today’s announcement is the £270 million
                that will fall in the years 2002-03 and 2003-04. The
                implications of the decisions for later years, when some of
                those projects will be completed, will be dealt with in future
                Budget rounds. In turn, that will mean that other projects,
                which would otherwise have had to wait longer for funding, will
                be accelerated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now explain the main actions that we
                have decided to initiate to address the key weaknesses of our
                infrastructure. The cancer centre is the most urgently needed
                major project in the Health Service. It has been a top priority
                for the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                and the departmental Committee. Through the centre we can combat
                more effectively one of the major causes of premature death
                here, saving many more lives than we have been able to do to
                date. We are pleased to confirm that the project will now
                proceed immediately. The funds are available, and the final
                business case has been proved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need to invest in our roads and transport
                networks is well known and understood by all Members as a key
                objective of the reinvestment and reform initiative. Today the
                Executive can confirm funding for strategic road improvement by
                making a start on the widening of the M1 approach to Belfast.
                That will be recognised as a highly worthwhile improvement by
                the many who have to use the route daily. Secondly, there will
                be structural maintenance of the major routes on the regional
                strategic transportation network, such as the A8 from Belfast to
                Larne, the A5 at Strabane, the A32 from Omagh to Enniskillen and
                the A28 at Newry.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further £14 million has been allocated for
                structural maintenance across a wider range of smaller schemes.
                Those allocations are over and above the £40 million that the
                Executive committed last year to specific actions on the major
                trans-European network route that runs between Larne, Belfast
                and the border south of Newry. Although most of that funding
                falls outside the time frame of this package, we reaffirm the
                commitments that will make action possible on those major
                developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed regional transportation strategy
                also highlights the need for major investment in public
                transport. We want to determine whether new and innovative
                approaches to funding are possible in that sector and, in order
                to return with new ideas in the autumn, we want to work with the
                Department for Regional Development. However, to address the
                issue, £5 million has been allocated to enable the purchase of
                40 buses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One area in which we inherited serious
                difficulties is the water and sewerage infrastructure. There is
                an investment backlog of several billion pounds there, with no
                actions having been taken on some structures for many decades.
                To avoid increased risk to health and the environment, and to
                ensure that housing and commercial development can proceed where
                it is needed, we must address those problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The package includes £23 million of
                additional capital investment in that sector. There will be
                action to improve the water mains and sewers in the following
                areas, which were identified by the Minister for Regional
                Development: Portadown, Cookstown, Belfast, west of Newry, north
                Antrim and Ballymena. Those actions are on top of the programme
                that is funded from the Department for Regional Development’s
                core budget, which accounts for a range of schemes that are
                being implemented. It is in exactly that type of area, in which
                we must invest for the longer term for generations ahead, that
                the borrowing power that we achieved under the reinvestment and
                reform initiative will play such a significant role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members know, we get nothing, and will get
                nothing, for water under the Barnett formula. Its cost will
                increasingly press on other services unless we can find new ways
                of funding investment to make that industry fully efficient and
                a resource for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, the Executive decided to support
                the proposals for the extension of the gas supply network
                through pipelines between Larne and the north-west and from the
                South to link with the existing network. That will greatly
                improve the range and security of supply. It will benefit many
                by widening choice and energy supply and will also make it
                possible for investment in the new Coolkeeragh Power Station to
                proceed. Today, we confirm that £12 million of the grant aid
                that the Executive have agreed to pay towards the pipeline
                project will come from the reinvestment and reform initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On housing, we are considering the regional
                infrastructure for energy and addressing the specific problem of
                fuel poverty. The initiative will make it possible for the
                Housing Executive to replace outdated heating systems in 2,000
                homes. Moreover, 75 new accommodation units will be provided to
                ensure that action can be taken to address the problem of
                homelessness. Action on homelessness and fuel poverty will show
                that the infrastructure package has a clear TSN dimension.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member said that he wished to raise a point
                of order about the non-availability of the statement at the
                commencement of business. I told him that I would not take a
                point of order during the statement. However, I hope that the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister have noted that the
                statement was not circulated until six minutes into the First
                Minister’s delivery. The Speaker dealt with the matter
                yesterday, and I am dealing with it again today. I hope that the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister will
                take note that, although there is no requirement in Standing
                Orders for Members to be provided with statements in advance, it
                is reasonable to expect a statement on such an important issue
                to be available before it is delivered in the Chamber.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your point is well made, Mr Deputy Speaker,
                and it has been well taken. Yet again, I apologise for the
                delay, which was partly to ensure that the First Minister and I
                did not repeat elements of the statement. It is more difficult
                to produce than a statement from a Department that has only one
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I detail some of the specific
                projects, I will focus on our strategic approach to deciding how
                to invest. I said at the launch of the reinvestment and reform
                initiative that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Devolution is not a theme park for soft
                options. It must be a building ground for new prosperity, a
                growing field for social transformation, a learning zone for new
                ways of providing, and providing for, public service&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We have to harness the skills of our
                public sector, the will of our voluntary sector, and the drive
                of our private sector to deliver the dynamic development we
                seek. The enterprise and expertise of the social partners, which
                has done so much to drive regeneration and reconciliation, can
                join government endeavour to change the regional
                landscape.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that the initiative includes major
                investments that are designed to touch on people’s social
                needs and improve their quality of life. The social inclusion
                dimension receives a full and fair share of our energy and
                resources. That dimension includes: health and social care; the
                fundamental needs of our schoolchildren; housing; and help with
                heating, which is often an anxiety for the elderly and other
                householders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive intend to set a short- and
                longer-term strategic direction for developing infrastructure.
                The project board and the Executive subcommittee will assist
                them in that work. The funds that are available for this year
                and the next will enable us to make an immediate start on the
                new strategic approach to infrastructure development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years, the Executive have agreed
                that several areas, especially health, education, transport,
                water and sewerage, suffer as a result of major infrastructure
                problems. The PPP working group examined the extent of those
                needs and their implications for our overall expenditure, and
                they are being considered in the Financing our Future
                consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the Executive have been examining
                in detail our need to invest in the Water Service. We have also
                been considering the Department for Regional Development’s
                proposed regional transportation strategy, and we have agreed
                that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s
                proposals on acute hospitals should be put forward for
                consultation also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that context, we have concluded that we
                now need a major set of investments that focus primarily on
                those areas. That approach fits in with the priorities that we
                identified in the Programme for Government and the Budget, which
                we want to refine in the coming year. We must also ensure that
                all new options are explored creatively and urgently so that
                people can benefit from better services and facilities. The
                fundamental idea behind the reinvestment and reform initiative
                is that it comprises investment, and there is no question of our
                simply topping up ordinary programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital for the initiative to make a
                strategic difference in addressing the infrastructure deficit
                and have an impact on the major needs that we identified. It
                must also demonstrate our commitment to reforming the delivery
                of public services. The reform agenda will be integral to the
                initiative, and appropriate action to progress reform must be an
                important element alongside all allocations from the new
                reinvestment and reform initiative funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong to commit ourselves to
                financing projects in a new way, using the £125 million loan
                that we secured from the reinvestment and reform initiative,
                without ensuring that appropriate action is taken to develop new
                expertise and a thorough approach to planning and management
                that will mark a break with the past. We can make a start now,
                and we must start as we mean to go on. However, I emphasise that
                some aspects of change, and a substantial leverage of investment
                from alternative sources, will take longer to acquire and will
                depend on the development and introduction of the strategic
                investment body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as the cancer centre, already
                mentioned by the First Minister, there is investment in
                essential capacity at six hospitals across Northern Ireland —
                Antrim Area Hospital, Craigavon Area Hospital, the Mater
                Hospital, Holywell Hospital, Musgrave Park Hospital and the Erne
                Hospital. The project at Antrim Area Hospital will include a
                local cancer unit, which will complement the main cancer centre
                as part of the strategic approach to addressing that very
                important issue. That investment will ensure that care of cancer
                patients in Northern Ireland will be improved to the standards
                achieved in the best EU countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will also be specific projects at five
                other hospitals — Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Stradreagh
                Hospital, Daisy Hill Hospital, Belfast City Hospital and
                Muckamore Abbey Hospital — and action to upgrade equipment at
                regional centres will improve services for all parts of the
                region. This is a major step up in investment in the Health
                Service estate and is designed to begin the reinvestment that is
                so badly needed. In total, £110 million from the total of £270
                million is going to Health Service projects. When we add the
                further costs to be incurred beyond 2003-04, the full value of
                the investment in health will be £167 million, which includes
                investment of £58 million in the cancer centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we can announce that funding will be
                available for three major new school schemes at St Patrick’s
                College, Dungannon; Fivemiletown High School and St Fanchea’s
                College, Enniskillen. Funding will also be available for the
                final phases at three other schools — Regent House School,
                Meánscoil Feirste and Thornhill College. Together with site
                purchases for future developments planned for a further two
                schools — Clondermot/ Faughan Valley High School and Abbey
                Christian Brothers’ Grammar School, Newry — the full value
                of this group of projects is £56·7 million. Three special
                schools will also be built at a cost of £11·9 million, two of
                which, Cedar Lodge and Harberton, will be in Belfast and the
                other, Roddensvale, in Larne. That will address the needs of
                pupils with learning difficulties and reduce the special schools
                major works backlog by one third. We are also committing £4
                million to the integrated sector to enable the Department of
                Education to make timely and important investment there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These major schools projects are underpinned
                by a commitment of £6 million to tackle the needs of 75 small
                rural schools, a quarter of all such schools. The work will
                involve replacing temporary accommodation and upgrading toilet
                facilities. The amounts will be allocated across the region
                where they are needed most.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also allocating £15 million to
                replace 20% of mobile classrooms with new accommodation. That
                will provide action on 200 classrooms in the first year and 600
                classrooms in the second year. Teachers and pupils deserve good
                accommodation in which to teach and learn. I am delighted that
                we have made such a significant step forward in this package.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investment in lifelong learning is vital for
                the future of society and for economic development. We are
                pleased to confirm the Executive’s support for a further
                programme of investment in university research infrastructure,
                which will be matched, pound for pound, by a private donor
                organisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investment in further education colleges is
                also being provided — £3·2 million in Limavady College of
                Further and Higher Education and £3·5 million in Fermanagh
                College of Further Education. Thus further and higher education
                will receive a total of £12·7 million from the initiative
                immediately, and total investment will be £56·7 million over
                the full period of the support programme for university research
                (SPUR).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To complete the package, the Executive have
                decided to provide £4·4 million to address the problem of silt
                and mud in the inner harbour at Kilkeel, which has prevented the
                regulator from granting the Fisheries Harbour Authority a
                licence for sea disposal. That will also support investment in
                the continued existence and safety of Kilkeel harbour and in the
                extensive structural repair of the South Pier and Windy Gap
                entrance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, it will enable the replacement of
                the slipway winch and at least one cradle, required for health
                and safety reasons.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We intend to use all of the £125 million of
                available borrowing in the period up to March 2004 alongside our
                mainstream public expenditure provision and the Executive
                programme funds. We will adhere to the principle that we should
                borrow to invest, not to support current spending programmes.
                Furthermore, we will not take out loans that are repayable over
                periods beyond the useful life of the assets that we are
                procuring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The projects that we are supporting represent
                a balanced investment package that will address some of the most
                pressing infrastructure needs in schools, the Health Service,
                roads, and water and sewerage services. The proposed measures
                will also enable us to address problems such as homelessness and
                fuel poverty. The measures confirm and underline the clear value
                and logic of the approach that we began through the Executive
                programme funds. That approach is already bearing fruit. All of
                these schemes are high priorities in the Programme for
                Government and, when delivered, should lead to real and visible
                improvements in the quality of public services. We are making a
                positive start on a strategically driven infrastructure
                programme, based on the priorities that we have already agreed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our proposals are also designed to support
                projects that can be implemented quickly, although this does not
                override our commitment to ensuring that the highest
                value-for-money standards are maintained. No projects will be
                allowed to incur expenditure until the economic appraisal
                process has been satisfactorily completed. We assure the
                Assembly that the projects selected for funding will be subject
                to rigorous analysis and scrutiny before final allocations are
                made. Let us be clear that the allocations are not about
                spending for the sake of it simply because we now have
                additional resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some instances, the allocations create
                ongoing commitments to complete certain projects, such as the
                cancer centre. These have to be confirmed in the 2002 Budget.
                However, much higher costs arise for certain projects in 2004-05
                and beyond. In those cases, the Assembly will be able to
                consider the need for any future investment in the Budget
                process later this year and as part of the longer-term
                allocations from the reinvestment and reform initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will also be looking to the strategic
                investment body to help us to deliver infrastructure programmes
                in a unique and strategic way. The new body will enable us to
                use the best mix of different sources of financing and
                procurement methods. That will make possible a more strategic
                approach to investment and procurement than could be achieved if
                it were left simply to the resources and devices of Departments,
                some of which are too small to develop and maintain the kind of
                expertise and drive that is needed to make this happen on a
                large scale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To ensure that the momentum of the initiative
                is sustained we will ask the Departments and the Executive to
                develop a further range of ideas for the next stage. In the
                meantime, we will continue to consider alternative sources of
                funding. The idea is that the project board and the strategic
                investment body should be able to help the Executive to examine
                and identify models and optimum funding sources. In that way we
                will be better able to respond to the range of ideas that will
                be put forward for the fuller development of the reinvestment
                and reform initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The investments under the short-term element
                of the reinvestment and reform initiative are a precursor to the
                potential of the longer-term provisions. The agreement has given
                us new relationships and responsibilities. The initiative offers
                new resources which, when combined with new resolve, can create
                new realities. Today’s welcome announcements are really a
                trailer for the quantity and quality of the public service
                investment we can achieve under the reinvestment and reform
                initiative in future. We can move from complaining about what we
                cannot do to planning what we can do, and from lamenting what
                has not been done to implementing what must be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have expressed fears about the
                reinvestment and reform initiative’s borrowing powers, despite
                the fact that they have been advocating public bonds. Borrowing
                for strategic investment is not about burdening our children; it
                is about providing for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some fret about responsible and affordable
                borrowing as imposing a debt on others to come, but we cannot
                pass on the investment deficit and dilapidated public estate
                that we have inherited. Indeed, we would be compounding the
                strategic negligence for which we have been criticising others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we believe in public services, public
                assets and public expenditure, then we should see strategic
                borrowing, funded by public revenue, as a form of solidarity
                between generations. It is not just about reversing the
                underinvestment in infrastructure and the public service fabric
                for this generation, but about fast-forwarding for the next
                generation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much comment in recent days
                about underspending. Part of our thinking in establishing the
                strategic investment body was a recognition that we could not
                rely on traditional forms of expenditure management to drive and
                deliver the necessary increased investment levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More importantly, we want to stress that it
                is long- term underinvestment, rather than the ephemeral
                impression of underspending, that is the real problem. It costs
                us, as a community and a region, in terms of socially important
                public services and economic competitiveness. We want to break
                the cycle of underinvestment in a way that will not compound the
                underspending problem. Hence, we have the reinvestment and
                reform initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These first fruits indicate our commitment in
                first establishing the Executive programme funds and then
                developing the reinvestment and reform initiative to articulate
                our strategic priorities through more strategic and
                better-targeted public spending. We stressed that the strategic
                investment would not be confined to the hard infrastructure of
                roads, transport, water, sewerage, gas or telecommunications,
                but apply also to the soft infrastructure of our public services
                estates in health, schools, colleges, social services, and even
                housing support. The range and balance of investments afforded
                and supported in the package announced today are a positive
                example of how social inclusion and strategic investment can be,
                as I have always believed, two sides of the public spending
                coin. We commend these actions to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has today announced a range of projects
                across most Departments that, hitherto, the Departments were not
                able to undertake. Do the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister agree that there should be no doubt as to where credit
                lies for the achievements of these socially worthwhile
                investments?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely with the Member about the
                value of these investments, and, indeed, the difficulty, or
                perhaps the impossibility, of tackling these in the normal way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point about water has not been fully
                appreciated. There will be no additional money through the
                Barnett formula for water in Northern Ireland, because there are
                no increases in expenditure in GB on that subject at all. We
                know that there is a huge deficit in investment there, and we
                would have no prospect of coping with that problem simply
                through squeezing out money from each year’s public
                expenditure round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only by coming outside the normal process and
                establishing this borrowing power — both short-term and
                long-term — would it ever have been possible to contemplate
                raising the money to deal with this issue. This has been an
                initiative that the Deputy First Minister and I have undertaken,
                with the support of the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, and
                it gives us an opportunity to tackle these issues. It will mean
                some hard choices having to be made on how we carry this matter
                through, but at least we have now made a clear start, which I
                hope will be welcomed by all Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron): </b>I warmly
                welcome the long-awaited go-ahead for the funding of the new
                cancer centre, which is the key missing link to a fully
                integrated cancer service for the people of Northern Ireland. I
                think of all the cancer patients who have been waiting —
                people such as Pat McGreevy, who we heard this morning on radio
                — and of the Ulster Cancer Foundation; Action Cancer; and Prof
                Paddy Johnston in the City Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question relates directly to the
                significant annual revenue costs of the centre. Its capital
                costs have already escalated from £32 million to £57 million.
                The new centre must be properly staffed with expert cancer
                clinicians and nurses and be equipped with the latest
                technology. The Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety’s inquiry into cancer services estimated that the
                revenue costs would be as high as £10·5 million a year.
                Therefore, will the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                give the Assembly a commitment that the necessary funds will be
                secured to support the increase in staffing and equipment costs?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister: </b>I acknowledge
                the Member’s welcome on behalf of the Committee for this
                announcement. I appreciate the direct and particular interest
                that the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                has taken in the cancer centre as part of the delivery of the
                regional cancer strategy, which was tabled many years ago and
                which we have all needed to see delivered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee first focused on the idea of
                targeting Executive programme funds or other moneys outside the
                departmental mainstream budget after it had seen the Executive
                make commitments to, for example, the gas pipeline and the road
                from Larne to Newry out of the Executive programme funds. The
                advances made with this vital care centre show the value of the
                concept of the Executive programme funds, now widened out into
                the broader concept of the reinvestment and reform initiative.
                These are enabling provisions that we have made. We have built
                an extension to the devolution house with this initiative. We
                have created other possibilities for ourselves so that
                initiatives that were not developing through our normal,
                confined constraints can now do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The announcement made today is about capital
                investment and use of borrowing power. I said in the statement
                that we would not be using borrowing power to fund running
                costs; that is not what we should use borrowing power for. It is
                for strategic capital investment. We do not intend to provide a
                centre that will not be properly equipped or staffed. The
                regional cancer centre’s equipment will be a call on capital
                investment for the future. That will be pursued through all the
                proper budgetary channels. Other costs will have to be met and
                absorbed through appropriate Budget provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have now broken the cycle of frustration
                around the cancer centre. I recognise the commitment of many
                interest groups, patient advocacy groups and professionals such
                as Paddy Johnston and Roy Spence. The Executive have now been
                able to deliver on that capital investment and provide a
                platform for all the professional commitment and all the
                commitment of departmental resources that will be needed to
                support that centre and deliver the strategy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome that fact that at long last the
                deficiencies of Fivemiletown High School have been acknowledged.
                That school should have been replaced long ago, but I suppose it
                is better late than never.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the allocation of funding for
                rural primary schools, the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister have said they are allocating £15 million to replace
                20% of mobile classrooms with new accommodation. A school in my
                constituency, Carntall Primary School in Clogher, cannot get a
                mobile classroom to accommodate its growth. The school has
                approximately 78 pupils, and it has been told it cannot exceed
                80 pupils. However, it will not qualify for additional
                accommodation until it has 85 pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does OFMDFM see such schools benefiting from
                the announcement today? Will this be left to the Department of
                Education, which is fully aware of the inadequacies that exist
                there, or will the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                give a directive on schools such as Carntall Primary School,
                which has been in need for years?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his welcome of
                resources for Fivemiletown High School. However, his question
                relates to small rural primary schools and to the provision of
                money for mobile classrooms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departments handle financial details. When
                the Member was a Minister he was properly jealous of that
                position, and he would appreciate that people who were then his
                ministerial Colleagues would have the same approach to this
                issue. The money that has been provided for the removal of
                mobile classrooms will reduce the existing number by 20%. That
                is a huge reduction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation of provision for small rural
                primary schools will improve accommodation at 75 schools, one
                quarter of which have fewer than 100 pupils. Small rural schools
                are under consideration, and allocation details will be
                announced in due course.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kilkeel harbour has been given £4·4

                agriculture is to remain a low priority or to have no priority
                — apart from departmental overspend — when will the
                Executive allocate funding to tackle major deficits in on-farm
                infrastructure and restructure?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statement concerns strategic capital
                investment, infrastructure and the fabric of the public service
                estate. These are priorities that were determined by the
                Executive, following recommendations from myself when I was
                Minister of Finance and Personnel and from the then First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister. Our recommendations were to
                focus on health, education and transport. To credit a Minister
                who did not attend the Executive with being part of that
                prioritisation process shows what sort of warped point-scoring
                goes on with some Members of Sinn Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and I, together with the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, undertook the reinvestment
                and reform initiative and promoted it in negotiations with the
                British Government. In private negotiations with the Treasury
                and the Prime Minister we made it clear that issues such as the
                cancer centre were exactly what we had in mind in our call for a
                short-term pillar of expenditure and not simply longer-term
                borrowing power. I hope that Members can do better than that
                type of cheap point-scoring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have made commitments that involve the use
                of borrowing power. We will not use borrowing power to fund
                programme costs, recurring costs or salaries. It will be used
                for strategic capital investment. Much expenditure in the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development does not come
                into that category. However, the fact that we can now use that
                type of collateral to help strategic capital investment on a
                range of programmes gives some latitude for other programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We look forward to the development of new
                ideas, which could include areas that we have not yet examined.
                If we had come to the Assembly with something for everyone in
                the audience, and something for all Departments, Members would
                say that such itsy-bitsy funding meant that there were no
                strategic priorities. Some Members, and some parties in
                particular, need to maintain some consistency.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of what the Deputy First Minister
                has just said, I shall begin by being somewhat parochial. As I
                read through the list of worthwhile projects, I must ask what
                has happened to the Lagan Valley constituency. What has happened
                to the second largest borough in Northern Ireland? When I look
                at roads I see mention of Larne, Strabane, Omagh and
                Enniskillen. When I look at hospitals, I see mention of almost
                every hospital except Lagan Valley Hospital. When I look at
                schools, I do not see one school in the Lagan Valley
                constituency mentioned. Bearing in mind that the borough
                suffered from an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis a couple of years
                ago, there is no mention of water and sewerage improvements in
                Lisburn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point is more important. I shall
                ask a couple of specific questions, to which I would like
                specific answers. Will OFMDFM give the House a categoric
                assurance that the projects announced in this morning’s
                statement, all of which are worthwhile, have gone through a full
                supporting economic appraisal based on value for money? Has the
                Department of Finance and Personnel fully scrutinised them? When
                will the Statutory Committees have an opportunity to view those
                economic appraisals? If they have not — and I doubt, as I read
                the relevant part of the statement, whether they have — will
                OFMDFM advise the House what magic formula was used to enable
                the proposals to be presented to the House?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member acknowledged that his initial
                concerns were a trifle parochial. However, I share some of them.
                I draw his attention to the modest sum allocated to the widening
                of the M1 motorway: that is the beginning of a significant
                development, which will be of benefit to the Member. Admittedly,
                it will take some time to get there, but it will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have acknowledged in the statement that
                water provision is a major problem. There is a clear need for
                major investment. We shall return to that issue in the autumn,

                have been subject to appraisal, and the relevant information
                will be conveyed to the relevant Committees. The Member will
                have the opportunity to examine that information in due course.
                It is important to note, as the Member acknowledges, that we
                have been able to make progress on several good projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many other good projects; our
                problem has always been that we did not have the resources to
                address as many infrastructure projects as we would have liked
                to. We have been able to commit £500 million. Six months ago,
                Members would not have thought that the Assembly would have had
                the opportunity to do that at this time. That is the result of
                the initiative that we have taken, which is supported by other
                Members in the Executive. We shall develop that initiative
                further. To carry on that work will involve some hard choices.
                It is the opportunity for the Administration and the Assembly to
                come of age.</p>

                the statement; it will help some necessary projects throughout
                Northern Ireland, especially in Fermanagh. I am glad that the
                A32 from Omagh to Enniskillen is to be upgraded. Enniskillen is
                a growth centre and the roads into the town must be improved.</p>

                Enniskillen. I am pleased that Fivemiletown High School has been
                mentioned, because I have lobbied on its behalf for some time.
                The school has done good work in that part of the world for a

                today, but the teachers there are working under extremely poor
                conditions that are unfair to the children in the school. I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already said that it will not be for
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                to go through the detail of the secondary allocations that will
                be made from some of the moneys announced today. However, there
                is extra money available to help support small rural schools.
                There is also new and extra money available to support the
                integrated education sector. As well as that, there is also the
                money that we have announced for specific schools capital
                projects and mobile classrooms. That money adds significantly to
                the Department of Education’s budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that direct benefits to a variety of
                schools will flow from these allocations. They should allow for
                some easement in the Department of Education’s already
                much-pressed budget. I hope that many schools with long-standing
                needs will benefit from the further announcements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister has eased the pressure on aspects of
                existing budgets, and it has made real new provision that will
                be targeted at schools which would not previously have qualified
                for consideration by conventional means. That is the added
                benefit of having this sort of Executive-inspired approach. I
                hope that many Members who have often expressed doubt about the
                facility offered by such discretionary instruments as the
                Executive programme funds or the reinvestment and reform
                initiative will now acknowledge that they see their distinctive
                value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing that strikes me — and I also had
                this experience when I was Minister of Finance and Personnel —
                is that these announcements from the Executive, either through
                the Department of Finance and Personnel or through OFMDFM, are
                subject to more questioning and scrutiny about what is being
                spent where than are the managed programmes of the Departments.
                Members should think about that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see that the Deputy First Minister will be
                answering my questions. Yesterday, when I asked him a simple
                question, with the unanimous backing of the Committee, I got an
                hysterical outburst and a personal attack. Perhaps I will get
                answers to my questions today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not one penny of the £510 million that is
                available has been allocated to the Department of the
                Environment. We must examine the strategic priorities. The
                Department made a bid for £2·5&nbsp;million to extend its
                Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency Headquarters to facilitate
                essential changes to meet the requirements of the Disability
                Discrimination Act 1995. That small amount of money would fund
                something of strategic importance. When will the Department of
                the Environment receive support from the Executive programme
                funds?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking in a personal capacity, I am sure
                that the schools that are getting investment will be delighted.
                However, I invite the Minister to come to Magherafelt, where he
                will find that the controlled primary and high schools are
                dilapidated and run-down, while there is excellent provision for
                maintained schools. When will the discrimination stop, and when
                will appropriate action be taken to fund controlled schools in
                the town?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several points must be borne in mind. The
                allocations are part of a package that the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister negotiated with the
                Treasury and the Prime Minister. We decided that the bulk of our
                priorities, given the short-term pillar of the reinvestment and
                reform initiative, would reflect those that were agreed not just
                by the Executive but by the Assembly when it adopted the Budget
                and the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no apology for our being consistent in
                the approach that has been mandated by the Executive. Much of
                the investment, not least on the water and sewerage side, will
                ensure that we move more quickly to comply with Directives being
                implemented by the Department of the Environment, which, as a
                watchdog and enforcer of standards, has an interest in
                expenditure outside that Department also. The Minister of the
                Environment has been pushing to ensure that more investment goes
                into water and sewerage so that we can comply with those
                Directives. That shows that that Minister practises joined-up
                Government and knows the implications of environmental issues
                beyond those contained in his Department’s fixed budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member complained that the Department of
                the Environment has not benefited from the Executive programme
                funds, but it has been well treated and supported over the past
                few years in the mainstream Budget. The Department received a
                25% increase in its budget over two years, an allocation that
                few other Departments received. That percentage increase amounts
                to more than the bid that Dr McCrea complains has not been met
                in this funding round. The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister is asking for ideas for investment at a
                further stage, and other issues will be dealt with in the Budget
                cycle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish the Member would have the good grace
                to welcome packages that provide extra money. The fact that
                additional money is being provided to the Department of
                Education must surely improve the prospects of the schools that
                have not yet been reached under traditional investment
                programmes.</p>

                There are many welcome announcements in today’s statement, and
                every constituency, with the exception of Lagan Valley and,
                apparently, South Antrim, has had its good news. In particular,
                I welcome the announcements on the road between Newry and the
                border, on Daisy Hill Hospital and on Abbey Grammar School,
                which I have keenly supported for some time. I congratulate the
                Deputy First Minister on scoring his own cheap political points
                in response to my Colleague, Gerry McHugh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Ministers tell me if there will be
                any implications for the ongoing negotiations with the Treasury,
                given that they have allocated this loan facility? Are there any
                implications for the negotiations for a fairer allocation under
                the Barnett formula, and will it have any impact on those
                discussions? That should be a priority for the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been many fine statements about
                the importance of reform as part of this package. What targets
                have the First and Deputy First Ministers set for reform? Is it
                merely to increase efficiency within Departments, or is it to
                change fundamentally how Departments and the Executive do
                business?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The improvements to the roads that will take
                place will be significant, and they were part of the view taken
                by the Executive of the immediate strategic priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most significant aspects of the
                reform is the strategic investment board and how we hope that it
                will develop. That body has just been established in shadow
                form, and the project board has started to meet. One outcome
                that we hope to see is an improvement in the range of financing
                that is available, with the centralisation of all the expertise
                in dealing with public finance initiatives and public-private
                partnerships in whatever body is formed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must improve the handling of private
                finance initiatives and public-private partnerships. That was
                evident on our recent visit to Scotland, where they have had
                more success in raising money from the private sector than we
                have. Part of the reason for that is that our expertise is
                scattered across the Departments. By focusing and concentrating
                that expertise in one place, we hope to have more success in
                raising money from the private sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the current allocation, there is a certain
                amount of private-sector finance. It is part of the way in which
                the £270 million, which is the initial expenditure for the next
                two years, will grow to £500 million in the longer term. When
                we come to deal with the longer-term issues, we want a better
                result. I cannot set targets for that, but we want to see a
                higher proportion of the money being brought in from outside, so
                that we are not limited to the public expenditure funds that we
                have. That public expenditure money can lever in significant
                sums from elsewhere, and that is one of the key reform aspects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other reviews that have been undertaken are
                also elements of reform. In particular, in the review of public
                administration we want to improve the quality of administration.
                The public service agreements and the service delivery
                agreements that are part of the Programme for Government are a
                key element.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also want to challenge Ministers to think
                carefully about what they do in their Departments and how they
                improve the efficiency and quality of the service they provide.
                We all have to consider ways to raise our game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Member’s questions on
                ongoing negations and the Barnett formula, there are certain
                realities that we must bear in mind. We all heard the
                announcement made by the Chancellor at the time of his Budget,
                and we know that he anticipated part of the spending review by
                announcing that he was committing large sums of money to health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the point of view of the analysts who
                looked at what the Chancellor said at the time of the Budget, it
                was clear that he was committing the bulk of additional public
                spending available in the next financial year to health. The
                amount of public spending available for other programmes will be
                quite limited. We know what the Barnett consequentials of the
                spending on health will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not yet know the other public spending
                increases that the Chancellor will announce. However, it was
                clear from Budget figures that moneys for sectors other than
                health will be limited. However, we will get Barnett
                consequentials. There are disadvantages with Barnett
                consequentials because they are per capita based, and public
                expenditure per capita is higher in Northern Ireland than
                elsewhere in the United Kingdom. When we discuss the side
                effects of Barnett consequentials with the Chancellor, we are
                given the obvious rejoinders: first, Northern Ireland receives
                better public expenditure per capita than elsewhere; and
                secondly, we are asked whether we are making the most efficient
                use of resources. We must be able to answer that question
                clearly, which is why reform must be at the heart of the
                initiative.</p>

                That is a huge burden on taxpayers, and I am pleased that £5
                million of the £23 million appears to have been allocated to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Member referred to his shared
                interest with Seamus Close, another Member for Lagan Valley, I
                could say that we must be careful about being too generous to
                Lagan Valley in case anyone thinks that we are trying to offer
                sweeteners to members of the Public Accounts Committee, who are
                normally forensic about implying that superficial consideration
                was given to certain allocations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the provisions are site-specific,
                while others will support relevant services across the region,
                including Lagan Valley and other constituencies. For instance,
                mobile classrooms are an issue for schools in Lagan Valley, as
                they are for schools elsewhere. It is not as if some parts of
                the region will not be touched or improved by the measures
                announced today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are problems with water because of
                underinvestment and serious leakage. Today’s investment
                announcement will directly support a programme that complies
                with the Public Accounts Committee’s recommendations. The
                Minister for Regional Development and his Department have
                identified many problems, which should not be underestimated.
                The Public Accounts Committee has brought certain aspects to the
                attention of the public. What is required with regard to water
                goes far beyond anything that is possible under the initiative.
                As the First Minister said, there are major long-term strategic
                issues for us to consider. Where we know the problems and what
                needs to be done, we must will the means to do it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the £6·7 million investment in
                further education and, specifically, the £3·2 million that
                will be invested in Limavady College of Further and Higher
                Education. Do the Ministers agree that that is only a beginning,
                that much has yet to be done to narrow the gap between
                vocational and academic education and that, if we are to address
                the imbalances of the past, further investment is necessary to
                promote lifelong learning and so widen access for people who
                were deprived of further education?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money that has been committed to Limavady
                College of Further and Higher Education will be used to replace
                current leased and temporary accommodation that is in urgent
                need of replacement. The new accommodation must meet present
                educational and skill demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also endorse the Member’s broader point
                and remind the House that, when we brought forward the package
                for further and higher education, it was for further, as well as
                higher, education. In doing that, we departed from what happened
                in Scotland, which was regarded as breaking new ground by
                providing support for students in higher education. Our overall
                package may not seem as generous as the Scottish one, but we
                decided to spread the money into further education as well as
                higher education. It was a deliberate decision, taken for the
                precise reason that the Member gave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Academic education is valuable but, from an
                economic point of view, there is also a need for the skills that
                become available through further education. It also opens up
                opportunities for a broader range of people. We are anxious that
                further education is not forgotten, just as we are anxious, with
                regard to educational provision as a whole, to level up, not
                level down.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The precise breakdown of the additional
                expenditure will be for the Department for Regional Development
                to provide. We have a list, but I do not intend to go through it
                in detail. However, the additional money will involve
                expenditure in several areas and will ease the pressure and
                backlog in other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, the sum total of spending
                by the Department for Regional Development on water and sewerage
                issues will not be confined to the new money. It will also
                involve the money that is already in the Department’s budget.
                I undertake to have the details provided to the Member by the
                Department for Regional Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no pretence that the additional money,
                helpful though it is to the areas that receive it, will be
                anything like what is needed to counter the scale of
                underinvestment in water and sewerage provision, which affects
                all parts of the region and is becoming an increasingly common
                problem. There is also pressure on planning because water and
                sewerage provision is under such strain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Member will be able to find
                some direct benefits for North Antrim. Where direct benefits are
                not immediately available there, I hope that his constituency
                will benefit from the easement in the existing departmental
                budget.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spoken previously about the neglect of
                our infrastructure in the west and other peripheral areas, so I
                warmly welcome this morning’s announcement and congratulate
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The £6
                million investment in rural schools is welcome, as is the £15
                million investment to replace mobile classrooms. Does the First
                Minister agree that the investment in rural schools will help to
                ensure that they continue to deliver education, which, in turn,
                will underpin local rural communities? Moreover, does he agree
                that mobile classrooms and the neglect of school estate were
                features of education under the control of direct-rule
                Ministers? Perhaps he will agree that it has taken the Assembly
                to begin to sort out that mess.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, this is an opportunity to deal with the
                underinvestment in infrastructure during direct rule, when it
                was all too easy to postpone capital projects to meet the many
                other pressures on budgets. As I said earlier, the particular
                provisions for their removal will reduce the number of mobile
                classrooms by approximately 20%, which is a substantial
                proportion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation will improve accommodation at
                75 small rural primary schools. That is one quarter of the total
                number of primary schools with fewer than 100 pupils, so a
                significant proportion of schools will be assisted by the
                project. The reinvestment and reform initiative has given us the
                opportunity to take action over and above what would normally
                result from public expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My earlier points about private finance are
                particularly appropriate for schools. Not so long ago, I had the
                pleasure of attending the opening of a school that was the
                result of a private finance initiative (PFI). One benefit of a
                PFI provision in schools is that it relieves teachers of the
                need to act as estate managers. Experts in property management
                will do that for them. That benefit is perhaps not yet fully
                appreciated by the public, which is one reason for wanting to
                improve our PFI performance. I hope that that will be a
                consequence of developing the strategic investment body.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement for two major
                reasons. First, it is indicative of new initiative thinking and
                of the value of devolved Government. The reinvestment and reform
                initiative and the earlier Executive programme funds initiative
                create new money and vindicate those who support devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the expenditure allocation for the
                new cancer centre, which, no doubt, will be appreciated by many
                families. In the parochial sense, I welcome the allocation of
                £4·4 million to the Kilkeel fishing industry, which will
                improve safety and support investment in the harbour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the many hospitals mentioned, was a bid
                made for new capital funding for the Downe Hospital in
                Downpatrick? The Ministers may not be able to tell me that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the Member’s broad welcome for
                the approach we outlined and for the devolution dividend that
                has been shown by the reinvestment and reform initiative, which
                follows from the new Executive strategic prioritisation that was
                shown by the creation of the Executive programme funds. We must
                continue to do that. We must show that devolution offers us a
                chance, not only to bridge divides between communities, but to
                continue to narrow the gap between what ought to be and what is.
                Initiatives that strategically use additional resources help us
                to narrow that gap.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional cancer centre is hugely welcome.
                Many of us have seen family and friends suffer from cancer. We
                have seen them struggle to cope as patients, and we have seen
                dedicated professionals struggle to administer treatment in
                inadequate and outdated conditions. They need and deserve better
                facilities, and we will deliver them. The regional cancer
                strategy is delivering the regional cancer centre and the
                additional cancer unit at Antrim Area Hospital. Alongside the
                regional cancer centre, the four units are significant pillars
                of the regional cancer strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Member welcomed the
                significant investment in Kilkeel harbour, and I hope that the
                fishing community in Kilkeel, which has faced recent stresses
                and distresses, welcomes it too. The Executive’s investment is
                a timely response to the needs of that community there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady referred to a bid for funding for
                Downe Hospital. A bid was not submitted specifically for Downe
                Hospital. I must repeat the caution that I have given on other
                occasions to other Members: we must not turn the scrutiny of
                these announcements into bid-chasing exercises, in which we try
                to come up with every possible bid. It would be easy for
                Departments to bid for everything. In fact, we had a daft
                situation in which some Departments submitted total bids that
                amounted to more than the total amount of money available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shortage of bids is not a problem;
                underspending is. I am not suggesting that Downe Hospital could
                not spend money allocated to it in a timely and strategic
                fashion, but the Assembly must break the bid-chasing cycle. The
                real issue is how Departments and services plan to manage and
                spend the money. The timescale for that pillar of the programme
                is this financial year and the next, so Departments concentrated
                on proposals that could use the funding straightaway. The
                timescale may, therefore, have determined the areas for which
                Departments submitted bids. However, if we want strategic
                investments and strategic commitments, we must move away from
                the bid frisking that Committees sometimes get hung up on.</p>

                will the money come from to pay the interest on the short-term
                borrowings? Where will the money come from to repay the
                considerable capital involved? Is it to come from charges levied
                on water, and possibly sewerage systems, and vast increases in
                rates? I ask that question bearing in mind that it was suggested
                that the Barnett formula will be required for running costs and
                that that money will not be used for anything other than capital
                investment in the black hole in our infrastructure.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for welcoming the
                announcements. I want to carp slightly at his terminology when
                he said that the investments had been &quot;delayed for so
                long&quot;. The Member is fair if he refers to delays during
                direct rule, but if he refers to delay on our part, I must point
                out that we have brought these proposals to the House a mere two
                months after the reinvestment and reform initiative was
                announced. The negotiations on the development of the initiative
                took a great deal of work over several months, and we have
                created a facility that was not anticipated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member knows, the short-term package
                — the £125 million that was borrowed to fund some of these
                investments over the next two years — will be paid for from
                existing revenue. There is no question of any increase in
                borrowing. That point was covered in the statement. The issues
                that the Member raised are important for our long-term
                objectives, and we must consider those carefully. We must be
                honest with ourselves and with the community in Northern
                Ireland. It is the same point that arises with regard to the
                Barnett formula. When we raise the issue of funding in Northern
                Ireland with the Treasury, we are asked if we are making the
                best use of existing resources and revenue. We can, and do,
                argue our case with the Treasury. However, compared to England,
                Wales and Scotland, there is undertaxation in Northern Ireland
                in respect of locally raised revenue, which runs at several
                hundred million pounds a year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider what we will do about that.
                Will we say to local people that we will try to get the Treasury
                to pay for their services when they are not contributing as much
                as people in England, Scotland and Wales? Is that a fair
                approach to taxation and expenditure across the kingdom? I think
                not. The rating review will enable us to consider the issue, and
                it will probably mean that there will be some increase in local
                taxation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the rates be increased?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rates might be increased or something
                else might be increased. That is what we have to consider. The
                rating review opens up the issue for discussion. The Assembly
                and the community in Northern Ireland must face that discussion.
                We must recognise that the level of taxation in local government
                in Northern Ireland is less than that in England, Scotland and
                Wales. Therefore we must consider that point and ask whether
                additional revenue can be found to meet the cost of future
                borrowing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the scare stories that have been
                spread in the media about what this may mean are, however,
                greatly exaggerated. The Assembly will make any decisions on the
                matter, and I hope that when we reach that point there will be
                grown-up discussion and consideration instead of some of the
                sillier points that have been raised in recent months.</p>

                question is brief and the answer equally brief, I will consider
                that I have received your co-operation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the announcement and, from a
                parochial perspective, the proposals for health, education and
                roads that affect my constituency, Newry and Armagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the education allocations,
                I seek assurance that they are consistent with the capital
                building list of contenders so that the schools on that list
                will receive the funding. I also seek assurance that the welcome
                replacement of 200 mobile classrooms will happen throughout the
                Province and across all education sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members were told that hard choices lie ahead
                for the Assembly. What is the nature of those choices? Will the
                Minister confirm that all parties in the Executive will share
                the burden of those hard choices?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations announced for specific
                capital projects are in line with the overall capital needs
                priorities as reflected by the Department of Education. The
                Committee for Education can pursue that aspect, if Mr Kennedy is
                not happy with my assurances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to use the extra spending capacity
                offered by the longer-term borrowing power, we will have to
                balance the amount that we can afford to borrow against the
                amount that we cannot afford not to spend. If we use the
                borrowing power, we will not have extra free money, because we
                will have to use public revenue to support our loan. That is one
                reason why there should be a focus only on strategic capital. It
                will be the Assembly — not just the parties in the Executive
                — that makes those choices.</p>

                make a statement on the British-Irish Council summit meeting,
                which was held on 14 June 2002 in Jersey.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that there have been no problems
                with the advance distribution of the text of the statements. I
                will make a statement on the British-Irish Council summit, and
                the Deputy First Minister will make a statement on the
                North/South Ministerial Council meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the Northern Ireland Ministers who
                attended the third summit meeting of the British-Irish Council
                have approved my report, and I make it on their behalf. The
                Deputy First Minister and I, together with the Minister of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, the Minister of Education, and
                the Minister for Employment and Learning, represented the
                Northern Ireland Administration. Representatives of the British
                and Irish Governments, the Scottish Executive, the National
                Assembly for Wales, the Isle of Man Government and the States of
                Jersey and Guernsey also attended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main focus of the meeting was the
                knowledge economy and the development of plans for co-operation
                on that issue in the British-Irish Council. It was apparent from
                discussions at the meeting that all British-Irish Council
                Administrations are actively working on strategies to address
                knowledge economy issues, and there was a good exchange of
                information and views on the wide variety of policies, methods
                and projects under way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognising the need to address important
                challenges in that area, it was agreed that work in the
                knowledge economy sector would include specific projects
                relating to the digital divide, such as providing access for
                disabled people to information and communication technology
                facilities and e-government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A group of knowledge economy officials from
                all the Administrations has been established to develop the
                issue, and sub-groups will progress matters of mutual interest
                in areas such as research, the digital divide and e-democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of the effective switchover to
                digital terrestrial television and competitive broadband markets
                was also recognised, and it was agreed that those matters could
                be considered further. Members also agreed to work together on
                the identification and development of pilot programmes for
                specific issues relating to the knowledge economy. The meeting
                heard about the outcomes of the recent British-Irish Council
                conference on bridging the digital divide, which was hosted by
                Jersey in April 2002. In consultation with other British-Irish
                Council Administrations, and along with the British-Irish
                Council Secretariat, Jersey took the lead in designing a
                British-Irish Council web site, which was launched after the
                meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An update was provided on sectoral work by
                the relevant lead Administrations. The Irish Government are
                taking the lead on drugs. Since the second summit meeting in
                Dublin in November 2001, at which the issue of drugs misuse was
                the main focus, drugs officials have been preparing
                recommendations for co-operation. A meeting of drugs Ministers,
                hosted by the Irish Government on 22 March, focused on the
                importance of targeting the proceeds of drugs trafficking, and
                of involving the community in the development and implementation
                of drugs strategies. It also considered the need to divert young
                people at risk into healthier pursuits, and to provide training
                and employment opportunities to recovering drug misusers.
                Further meetings on diversion programmes for young people at
                risk and reintegration and training opportunities for recovering
                drug misusers are scheduled to take place in the coming months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A conference on targeting the proceeds of the
                drugs trade, hosted by Guernsey, took place in May 2002. A
                further conference on community involvement in the development
                and implementation of drugs strategies will be hosted by the
                Northern Ireland Executive in November 2002. The next meeting of
                Ministers to review developments is scheduled to take place in
                Dublin in spring 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United Kingdom Government have been
                taking the lead in the environment sector. In February 2002,
                British-Irish Council Environment Ministers met for the second
                time in Edinburgh to consider waste management, Sellafield and
                radioactive waste, marine nature conservation, and climate
                change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scottish Executive, with other members,
                continue to advance work to find more sustainable ways of
                managing generated waste, which is a matter of increasing
                concern to British-Irish Council members. The Scottish Executive
                gave a presentation on the issue to other members at the
                Edinburgh meeting, and work to address the challenge and to
                identify the scope for co-operation continues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ireland and the Isle of Man have taken the
                lead in examining the issue of radioactive waste from Sellafield.
                Ministers discussed the matter during their recent meeting, and
                it will be considered further at the next meeting of environment
                Ministers, which will be hosted by Northern Ireland in autumn
                2002. There will be a further meeting of Ministers in the Isle
                of Man next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scotland and Wales are the lead
                Administrations on social inclusion, which will be the central
                focus of the next summit meeting. Current proposals for future
                co-operation include practical processes for sharing information
                and best practice for promoting social inclusion at community
                level. Future work will also build on existing experiences of
                networking between communities. Communities will be involved in
                the development of the Council’s future programme of
                co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the summit meeting in
                Scotland, a community inclusion conference is scheduled to take
                place in Glasgow in September 2002, when the main theme will be
                financial inclusion. Plans to develop an electronic community
                inclusion network are also being considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is the lead Administration
                on transport. British-Irish Council officials have met to
                progress work on several aspects of the transport sector that
                were identified at the first summit and at a ministerial meeting
                that took place in Belfast in December 2000. As part of that
                work, the Irish Government have agreed to take the lead on
                integrated transport matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials from all British-Irish Council
                Administrations are also exploring the possibility of an
                exchange of views and experience of public-private partnerships
                for transport infrastructure. Having recognised that there is
                considerable scope for co-operation on road safety issues, the
                Administrations are also identifying areas that could be
                developed in that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regional air links, which are of particular
                concern to several Members, are among the other matters under
                active consideration. The Northern Ireland Executive will host a
                ministerial meeting soon to discuss those issues further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Isle of Man agreed to take the lead on
                the application of telemedicine at the summit meeting in
                November 2001. Initial meetings of officials have taken place to
                plan future co-operation, and proposals currently include the
                monitoring and exchange of information on the use of
                telemedicine and evaluation of the benefits to be derived by
                implementing telemedicine and e-health clinically, educationally
                and organisationally. Further meetings, including a number of
                study visits to telemedicine projects across British-Irish
                Council Administrations, are scheduled to take place before the
                end of the year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also agreed at the summit meeting in
                November 2001 that Guernsey would be the lead Administration on
                tourism. Officials continue to discuss how best to advance work
                in this area. Future plans include proposals to identify common
                visitor data and an examination of tourism satellite accounting.
                The challenges of transport access, industry contacts, disabled
                access, and links between the environment and tourism, as well
                as training and the support of small businesses in the sector,
                will also be considered. Further meetings to develop this work
                are planned for the coming months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that the National Assembly
                for Wales would take forward work in the area of minority and
                lesser-used languages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting considered proposals to improve
                the workings of the Council, and it was agreed that the senior
                co-ordinating officials group, which comprises officials from
                all Administrations, will examine how best the Council can be
                supported and developed in order to promote and maximise its
                impact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This group will also consider whether further
                benefit could be derived from the bilateral and multilateral
                arrangements between two or more members described in paragraph
                10 of strand three of the agreement. The Council also agreed
                that the senior co-ordinating officials group should bring
                forward proposals to the next summit meeting so that the Council
                might consider how to encourage the development of the
                inter-parliamentary links provided for in paragraph 11 of strand
                three of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that Scotland will host
                the next summit in November 2002, and that the meeting will
                focus on the issue of social inclusion. Northern Ireland and
                Wales will host summit meetings in 2003. A copy of the
                communiqué issued following the meeting has been placed in the
                Assembly Library.</p>

                Governments?</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, indeed it will. Meetings will not always
                involve all eight Administrations, as only a limited number of
                items are of direct interest to all, and progress has been made
                on having meetings in different formats, and on some form of
                variable geometry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister and I have
                discussed this with the Scottish Administration, and there is a
                tentative agreement. We have not yet involved the Welsh in these
                discussions. We are working towards a situation where the Scots,
                the Welsh, and our own Administration meet regularly to look at
                common interests and issues. As the three devolved regions
                within the United Kingdom, there are some issues that apply
                directly to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see this activity occurring within the
                British-Irish Council framework, and as part of those bilateral
                and trilateral activities that are actually provided for in the
                agreement. The other participating Administrations in the
                Council will be informed about what is happening, and will
                hopefully not feel that the three of us are ganging up on any

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of drugs, the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety will host a conference
                in November 2002 in Northern Ireland. This will explore models
                of good practice and involving communities in local strategies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is proposed that the conference will
                include community-based speakers from member countries, who will
                share their experiences of working alongside policy makers and
                statutory agencies to implement their respective strategies.
                British-Irish Council members will also be invited to speak
                about their experience in developing partnership networks across
                Departments between voluntary, community and statutory sectors,
                and the importance of community involvement in the
                implementation of local strategies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Welsh Administration proposed holding a
                sectoral meeting on minority and lesser-used languages. Given
                that many people in Wales speak Welsh, they have some expertise
                in that area. It is natural to think of that in relation to
                other British-Irish Council members where minority and
                lesser-used languages are also used. It is a new proposal. The
                Welsh Administration did not go into detail on its possible
                ambit, so I cannot answer the Member’s specific question about
                sign language. We will bear it in mind and see if inquiries can
                be made. If there is any information, it can be communicated
                subsequently to the Member.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would the First Minister pass on my
                congratulations to the Government of Jersey for not only taking
                the lead in designing a web site, but in appearing to have
                achieved that? I counted 33 phrases in the First Minister’s
                statement similar to, and including, &quot;will also
                consider&quot;, &quot;development of pilot programmes&quot;,
                &quot;preparing recommendations&quot; and &quot;work
                continues&quot;. In the face of those aspirations, surely we
                should all welcome the fact that at least Jersey has achieved
                something.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister referred to Northern
                Ireland taking the lead on transport matters. Neither the
                Minister for Regional Development nor the Minister of the

                us a flavour of what has been achieved by his Administration in
                transport co-ordination, especially in road safety?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would put a slightly different
                interpretation on the phrases that the Member has drawn to my
                attention. Drawing attention to ongoing work and work that will
                be done in the future highlights the fact that the British-Irish
                Council is developing. The Council has taken some time to build
                up. The number of references to ongoing work — and I am
                indebted to the Member for telling us the total number — is a
                sign that the Council is developing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also join with Mr Ford in congratulating
                Jersey for the progress they have made; it was good to launch
                the web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work continues on transport. At the sectoral
                meeting an idea was developed that related directly to road
                safety, and especially to legislation in different jurisdictions
                and the consideration of a means of making that legislation read
                across from one jurisdiction to another. It was pointed out that
                many road accidents happen near the border. The reason for that
                seems to be that when drivers cross the border, they think that
                they are now on the other side and do not have to worry to the
                same extent about road traffic legislation and penalties. Now
                that we are all moving towards a penalty points system, the idea
                was mooted that we try to ensure that there is reciprocal
                enforcement so that drivers from both sides of the border
                realise that when they cross the border, the law still applies
                to them. Those ideas are being advanced.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will he confirm that public-private
                partnerships are used more extensively in England, Scotland and
                Wales, and also in the Republic of Ireland? Does he accept that
                Northern Ireland has been relatively slow to use public-private

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That question could have been asked regarding
                the previous statement. I have said that officials in the
                British-Irish Council Administrations are exploring the
                possibility of exchanges of views and experiences regarding PPPs,
                especially in relation to transport infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not have a great deal of experience of
                PPPs in Northern Ireland, and we have a lot to learn from other
                British-Irish Council Administrations. We look forward to the
                exchange of information on that. The subject was discussed when
                we visited the Scottish Executive in Edinburgh. They have been
                successful in raising several billion pounds from private
                finance for projects, particularly with regard to schools. We
                are moving only in a small way on that, but we are hoping to
                improve our performance through the reinvestment and reform
                initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will stray for a moment into the territory
                of the Deputy First Minister. There is a national finance
                corporation in the Republic of Ireland that bears some
                similarity to the strategic investment body that we are
                developing. There will be areas there where there can be a
                useful exchange of information.</p>

                Radioactive waste from Sellafield was discussed recently by the
                Environment Ministers in Edinburgh, and it will be considered at
                a meeting here in the autumn. I welcome that. Many people are
                expressing public concerns about the implications of an attack
                on British nuclear plants such as Sellafield, and the potential
                risk to the people in Ireland should not be underestimated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That risk was underlined in the recently
                released first report from the Office for Civil Nuclear Safety,
                which discloses deficiencies that are hampering attempts to
                protect those plants. Will that report be examined in detail at
                the autumn meeting, and will it look at the grave risk that
                Sellafield poses to Ireland and the Irish people? Will the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, through the
                British-Irish Council, press for the closure of Sellafield?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The National Assembly for Wales is to take
                forward work in the area of minority and lesser-used languages.
                Can we have more detail about that work and how it might impact
                on the development of the Irish language?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Member of the answer I gave on
                languages a few moments ago. That proposal has come from the
                Welsh Administration and it struck us as a good, sensible
                proposal because several Administrations have minority and
                lesser-used languages, and something may be learnt from the
                experience of others. We look forward with interest to what the
                National Assembly for Wales has to say, what ideas it brings
                forward and what we can learn from its experience. I cannot give
                the Member any more information, but no doubt there will be
                further developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to see that the Member is alive to
                the danger of terrorist attacks on Sellafield or other
                installations of that nature. We are all very much alive to that
                following September 11. However, it has not come up in the
                British-Irish Council. It is a matter that comes up through the
                Civil Contingencies Committee, which exists on a UK basis. The
                Northern Ireland Administration is represented on that committee
                and has attended meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Efforts have been made by the Civil
                Contingencies Committee to ensure that contingency plans for
                major emergencies are up-to-date and robust. I am assured that
                our plans for any contingency of that nature have been reviewed
                and are robust. However, we should hope that there is no
                terrorist attack on Sellafield and support what Governments are
                doing worldwide in the pursuit of the war against terrorism.</p>

                available by 2005. However, that is only half the story; that
                target will have to be matched by citizens in order to maximise
                access to those channels. A strategy document on the matter is

                which is Sellafield and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. I welcome the
                fact that all Governments are now concentrating on that area,
                although I am somewhat sceptical about the report, which says
                that the UK Government, a principal stakeholder, is taking the
                lead in the environmental sector. I shall watch that space with
                care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the Ministers’ attention to the fact

                announce the establishment of a liabilities management authority
                and the possible dismemberment of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
                That will result in taxpayers, including those in Northern
                Ireland, picking up the tab for 50 years of nuclear waste
                accumulation. Will the Ministers ensure that all facets of the
                nuclear industry will be on the agenda next autumn on the Isle
                of Man? During my recent visit there, its Government outlined
                their grave concerns and their determination to pursue the
                commencement of the decommissioning process, which is creating
                the additional long-term waste. I want an assurance that, at the

                him that the Republic of Ireland and the Isle of Man have taken
                the lead on the issue of Sellafield and radioactive waste. A
                paper prepared by Ireland and Mann was presented at the
                environment sectoral meeting in Edinburgh in February 2002.
                Since that paper was presented there have been several
                developments, such as the UK Government’s decision on the
                Sellafield MOX plant, the environment agencies’ consultation
                on the review of authorisations to dispose of radioactive waste
                from British Nuclear Fuels Ltd at Sellafield and the UK-wide
                public consultation on managing radioactive waste activity.
                Indeed, as the Member said, there may be further developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Edinburgh meeting agreed that the paper
                should be redrafted to take account of those issues. The revised

                parliamentary forum. The Assembly rejected that motion, largely
                through the votes of Ulster Unionist Members. Media reports over

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. A
                Member has a right to raise a point of order if it is not along
                the same line as the point of order that you have ruled against.
                That is the right of every Member.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has a right to attempt to make a
                point of order before a statement is made, as the Speaker made
                clear yesterday. That is why I allowed Mr Ford to continue for
                some time. I heard what he was saying, and it was not a point of
                order. I call the Deputy First Minister, Mr Mark Durkan.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Durkan):</b>
                With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Ministers
                who attended I will make a statement on the fourth plenary
                meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) held on
                Friday, 28 June 2002 in Armagh. The eight Ministers whose names
                have been notified to the Assembly participated in the meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plenary meeting reviewed the programme of
                work which it had put on train at its first meeting in Armagh in
                December 1999 and received a progress report on the work of the
                NSMC at meetings in sectoral format since January 2002. The
                Council heard reports on the valuable work being done in those
                sectors. Both sides look forward to the delivery of further
                tangible benefits to both jurisdictions. The council noted that
                the useful first meeting took place in institutional format in
                December 2001 and looked forward to continuing its work in that
                format.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered proposals brought
                forward by the consultative forum working group following
                consultation with the Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the
                social partners in the South which are participating in the
                central review mechanism of the Programme for Prosperity and
                Fairness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An outline structure for a North/South
                consultative forum was agreed by the Council. A twice-yearly
                conference will take place, alternating between North and South
                and comprising representatives of civil society in the North and
                South. The planning and organisation of the first conference
                will be undertaken by a steering committee drawn from the
                Northern Ireland Civic Forum and the social partners in the
                South participating in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness
                in liaison with the two Administrations. The steering committee
                will also invite representatives from a range of relevant
                organisations from the North and South to participate in the
                conferences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the analysis put forward by
                the working group, which was set up to consider areas of
                co-operation, and agreed that there is potential for mutual
                benefit from co-operation in areas such as strategic investment
                in infrastructure, including strategic transport issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also agreed that the appropriate
                Ministers in the respective North/South Ministerial Council
                sectors should consider whether there are matters within
                existing areas of co-operation which might be included in their
                future programme of work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to North/South co-operation
                outside the North/South Ministerial Council, it was agreed that
                Ministers would examine the working group’s proposals. The
                Council considered the provisions of the agreement that
                established the North/South bodies for the transfer of the
                functions carried out by the Irish Lights Commissioners to the
                Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. It recognised
                that complex issues surround such a transfer, and it asked the
                relevant Ministers and Departments, North and South, to examine
                urgently the alternative possibilities and make proposals to the
                Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council discussed European Union matters
                and considered a report from the EU working group. Recognising
                the importance of the EU to both jurisdictions, the Council
                decided that Ministers might consider the European dimension of
                North/South co-operation at the next sectoral meetings of the
                North/South Ministerial Council. It also decided that the
                working group should make an overall assessment of EU issues
                that are likely to arise. Further consideration will be given to
                how the Council’s views can be reflected appropriately at EU
                meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered proposals to overcome
                obstacles to cross-border mobility on the island of Ireland.
                Consultants carried out a study on the matter, which was
                published earlier this year, after which there was extensive
                public consultation. The Council was pleased to note that, since
                commissioning the study and the consultation process, some
                recommendations have been implemented. In response to
                recommendations on the difficulty of accessing information on
                issues relating to North/South mobility, the Council agreed to
                establish a web site providing comprehensive and easily
                accessible information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also decided that recommendations
                for education, work, health and pensions should be considered by
                relevant Government Departments so that they can make detailed
                proposals for implementation, including costs. It also decided
                that officials from the two Administrations would further
                examine other recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted the annual report on the
                activities of the North/South Ministerial Council from 1 January
                2001 to 31 December 2001. That report will be published soon.
                The Council noted the development of two similar investment
                initiatives: the National Development Finance Agency in the
                South and the strategic investment body in the North. It
                welcomed the proposals for infrastructure development being
                prepared by both Administrations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council, when considering the provision
                for a joint parliamentary forum in strand two of the agreement,
                recognised that the development of any such forum is a matter
                for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the two houses of the
                Oireachtas. It agreed that officials from the two
                Administrations should contact officials in the elected
                institutions and report to the next plenary meeting. The Council
                noted a recently completed economic appraisal of the options for
                accommodation for the joint secretariat of the North/South
                Ministerial Council in Armagh. It agreed that those options
                should be considered by the two Administrations in liaison with
                the joint project team and that they should be presented at a
                Council meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council approved a schedule of
                North/South Ministerial Council meetings to take place over the
                coming months. Before the meeting commenced, the First Minister,
                the Taoiseach and I launched the North/ South Ministerial
                Council web site. The Council agreed that its next plenary
                meeting would take place in Northern Ireland in November 2002. A
                copy of the communiqué that was issued after the meeting has
                been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future business of the North/South
                Ministerial Council, in its various formats, will be business
                driven in that work being carried out at present must be
                followed up by the relevant sectoral format. The Council agreed
                at its meeting on Friday that the sectoral formats would
                consider EU matters that may be of relevance to them and examine
                other opportunities for co-operation that have not yet been
                activated. There is work to be done and followed through in the
                meetings in each sectoral format, so future meetings will be
                entirely business led.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Member’s latter point, we may be
                able to hold the next plenary meeting in Magee College in
                November. I hope that we will be able to fulfil the Member’s
                ambitions and that the local hospitality matches the standard
                that she claims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The discussion we had on the strategic
                investment body and the National Development Finance Agency took
                place at a time when our plans and proposals for those entities
                were at a formative stage. We shared with the Southern Ministers
                the background to the reinvestment and reform initiative and the
                role we envisaged for the strategic investment body, which is to
                deliver supporting finance solutions for the programmes and
                priorities that will be determined on the democratic, political
                side by Ministers, Departments and the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Southern Ministers filled us in on the
                background to the National Development Finance Agency. Although
                the scope for activity and support by the bodies is similar,
                there are some distinctions. Given that we will be talking about
                strategic investment, which on some occasions will have a
                North/South dimension, and about trying to lever in other
                sources of funding that may include funding from international
                markets, it makes sense to compare notes and exchange ideas. It
                is a situation in which great minds think alike. We have
                produced and developed an entity similar to that in the South,
                so we should maximise the advantages of further comparisons and
                co-ordinate and collaborate in the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ministers’ report on the NSMC plenary
                meeting states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In regard to the North/South
                co-operation outside the NSMC, it was agreed that Ministers
                would examine the working group’s proposals.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely that is a major extension of the area
                in which the NSMC should work? It seems that political issues
                that are not within the framework are to be brought in. It has
                been advocated that the NSMC should make representations at
                European meetings on European matters. That would weaken the
                status of Northern Ireland as a separate entity from the Irish
                Republic and prevent Northern Ireland from making its own case
                in association with the rest of the United Kingdom and Europe.
                Keeping those points in mind, can the First Minister and his
                deputy tell the House the cost of the proposed increase of the
                North/South quango? Can they confirm that it is the Dublin
                Government that is driving the agenda for the benefit of those
                who demand a united Ireland? Can they further confirm that the
                Northern Ireland Assembly has no power to alter the budget of
                that all-Ireland vehicle in which they seem to participate so
                enthusiastically?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Member that what I said was with
                regard not to North/South co-operation that is not taking place
                but to North/South co-operation that is taking place outside the
                NSMC. It was agreed in respect of that kind of co-operation that
                Ministers would examine the working group’s proposals. That
                was discussed earlier in the year when the First Minister and I
                reported on the meeting in the NSMC’s institutional format
                that considered other areas of co-operation that were taking
                place outside the NSMC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An extensive range of areas of co-operation
                is being pursued on a Department-to-Department and civil
                servant-to-civil servant basis. I would have thought that the
                Member, who is so assiduous in trying to ensure that anything
                that happens should happen under the spotlight and
                accountability of OFMDFM and that Ministers should be
                accountable for everything that their Departments do, would not
                be averse to ensuring that all areas of activity that are
                undertaken by Departments on a cross-border, North/South basis,
                would be considered for inclusion in the areas of co-operation
                that are conducted under the NSMC and would, therefore, be the
                subject of accountable statements in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us be clear about EU matters. Nobody
                talks about Northern Ireland as a region that does not have its
                own case on EU issues. Clearly, Northern Ireland has its own
                case. Northern Ireland’s regional case on EU matters is often
                different from the priorities of and cases made by the UK
                Government. At times, it is also distinct from the priorities
                and interests of the Irish Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland must use all available
                channels to promote its needs. That involves MEPs and their role
                in the European Parliament. It involves the Assembly, using
                every means available through joint ministerial committees and
                other opportunities, such as its influence on the position of
                the UK Government. It includes Northern Ireland’s Ministers
                being involved directly in the business of the EU Council,
                alongside UK Ministers. All that has been done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, being able to use the NSMC to
                explore issues of common concern and possible differences and,
                therefore, rivalries and tensions that we might want to minimise
                when matters are discussed at EU level, will add one more layer
                of advocacy and support to Northern Ireland’s regional
                interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are occasions when it is directly in
                Northern Ireland’s regional interest that present at the EU
                Council of Ministers are not just the UK Ministers whom we have
                lobbied and badgered, but Ministers from another member state
                — our neighbouring Ministers in the South, who fully
                understand Northern Ireland’s needs and are often promoting a
                similar case. An example of that is fisheries. This is about
                maximising the opportunities that are afforded to us to promote
                Northern Ireland’s interests in the EU.</p>

                see the EU treat Ireland as a single unit for all matters. I
                made a statement on the business of the North/South Ministerial
                Council. I am not here to preach my personal opinion on
                different matters and different future arrangements. I am here
                to record in good faith what was transacted at a meeting of the
                North/South Ministerial Council and deliver a statement that was
                approved and agreed by all the Ministers who attended that
                meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not for me, as a Minister making a
                statement on behalf of other Ministers, to embroider all sorts
                of things in all sorts of directions. If I were to do that, I
                would remind the Member that at least the SDLP, as a party that
                wants to talk about Europe and Ireland as a single unit, wants
                the euro throughout Ireland, while Sinn Féin appears to be
                sterling in its opposition to the euro and wants partition in
                that respect. We should not get into that here, and I should
                resist the Member’s temptation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the recommendations of the obstacles
                to mobility study have already been implemented; others are the
                subject of further exploration and consideration and will, as I
                said, come forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A web site specific to the NSMC has been
                launched, and the Member will be able to find all the
                appropriate details there. I do not have a calendar to hand, but
                I will be able to provide the Member with details of the
                schedule of future meetings.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister mentioned the
                potential for mutual benefit on strategic transport issues. It
                was a fairly limited statement on something that has such major
                potential importance for transport on this island as a whole.
                Can he enunciate further on that?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reflected what was discussed. We did not
                fill in specific proposals or projects at the meeting, which was
                exploratory and illustrative. My statement was an honest
                reflection of the quality of the discussion that we had. I do
                not want to understate the significance of this or overstate the
                nature of the agreement and the understanding that we came to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us be clear: as with the British-Irish
                Council, this process will not work on the basis of immediate
                fixed products at any time. Because we are talking about areas
                of mutual interest, mutual co-operation and common advantage,
                the work will, by necessity, take time and require due
                consideration and diligence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have recognised the importance of those
                areas. The separate discussion on the National Development
                Finance Agency in the South and the strategic investment body in
                the North was also relevant and, in many ways, corroborates the
                positive assessment that was made on the possibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic transport possibilities do not
                only apply to those who happen to live in border areas and can
                see some of the more immediate localised infrastructure issues;
                they apply on an entirely strategic basis across this region and
                the South. Obviously, there is much more to be done. I do not
                know whether the relevant Assembly Committees want to try
                suggesting other possibilities, but they are certainly free to
                take an interest in them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member has not availed
                of the opportunity, which you said would be available, to ask me
                specifically about what consideration we gave to provisions for
                an interparliamentary forum.</p>

                however, further to discussions through the appropriate
                channels, I am informed that the intention is to continue

                Council agreed an outline structure for a North/South
                consultative forum, and that a biannual conference will take
                place. What are the desired benefits of a joint civic forum
                conference?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A North/South consultative forum is provided
                for in the Good Friday Agreement, but the provision has not yet
                been activated or pursued. The North/South Ministerial Council
                adopted an approach that does not involve creating a new entity
                whose members are separate from the existing social partner
                representative organisations — the Civic Forum here and the
                Central Review Panel for the Programme for Prosperity and
                Fairness in the South. The joint conference will involve members
                of those two bodies, which represent the broad interests of
                civic society. The steering group will be provided for members
                of those organisations. It makes sense to follow through on the
                provision in the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the two representative bodies and
                other interested parties have useful insight that would help to
                identify concerns and obstacles to mobility that affect
                individuals, sectors and localities daily. The forum will be
                able to reflect on some of the North/South Ministerial Council’s
                work and on other issues that the Council does not address.
                Moreover, it will be able to indicate and, I hope, promote some
                of the very good cross-border partnership work outside
                Government, for example, in cross-border councils and the
                community and voluntary sectors. It will also consider the many
                private sector initiatives through the Confederation of British
                Industries and the Irish Business and Employers’
                Confederation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The conference will provide a channel for
                reflection by those disparate groups. Just as the Civic Forum is
                designed to provide a common platform for different interests in
                the North, the joint consultative forum would provide a common
                channel for the cross-border interests and activities of
                different policy communities.</p>

                strategic transport is an important element of economic and
                social development on this island? Given that tomorrow the
                Assembly will debate the regional transport strategy, and in the
                light of the report on co-operation on strategic transport, does
                the North/South Ministerial Council intend to create a sectoral
                group to deal with the issue? A sectoral group on strategic
                transport was envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and would
                facilitate broader discussion and Executive action, if
                appropriate, on North/South transportation and infrastructure.</p>

                considering the matter in the context of the reinvestment and
                reform initiative. The Executive are trying to prioritise the
                issue and are pursuing it through the North/South Ministerial
                Council and the British-Irish Council. Therefore, that is a

                on the body’s activities by Seosamh Mac Donncha, chief
                executive of Foras na Gaeilge, and George Holmes, the deputy
                chief executive of Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch. The report covered
                areas such as corporate and business planning, the activity
                report for 2002, the equality scheme, the code of conduct for
                board members, and administrative issues on staffing and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The business plan for Foras na Gaelige
                describes the activities that it intends to undertake in 2002 to
                address the key challenges and objectives in its strategic plan,
                as well as the resources that it will employ. That includes the
                work to be undertaken on: state culture and heritage;
                communications and marketing, community and business; education
                services such as the English/Irish dictionary; and corporate
                planning, which includes the establishment of a Belfast office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The business plan for 2002 for Tha Boord o
                Ulster-Scotch is aligned with its corporate plan 2001-03 on four
                strategic themes: linguistic diversity; culture; education; and
                public understanding of Ulster-Scots language and culture. That
                plan identifies resources, objectives, key deliverables, targets
                and impacts associated with activities that are related to the
                four themes. Those activities will include projects such as: a
                tape-recorded survey of native speakers; production of a
                textbook for written Ulster-Scots; compilation of a dictionary;
                a programme of cultural activities and development of formal
                academic courses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered and noted the progress
                reports on the corporate planning issues that relate to Foras na
                Gaeilge and Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch, and it looked forward to
                the presentation of the finalised corporate plans for both
                agencies at the next language sector North/South Ministerial
                Council meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council considered and approved the
                content of the draft activity reports for both agencies for the
                period 2 December 1999 to 31 December 2000. Tha Boord o
                Ulster-Scotch’s activities during the year included the
                creation of the first ever three-year strategy for the agency
                and a partnership agreement between the agency and the
                University of Ulster to establish the Institute of Ulster-Scots
                Studies at Magee College.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also noted the draft unaudited
                accounts for both agencies, and noted that further work is
                required before the statement of accounts for the language body
                can be submitted to the Comptrollers and Auditors General in
                both jurisdictions for formal audit.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency is responsible and answerable for
                its own actions by agreement with the Department and the
                North/South Ministerial Council, and through them to the House.
                The agency has a three-year corporate plan, which has recently
                been reviewed and extended to 2005. It sets out four strategic
                themes on linguistic diversity, culture, education and public
                understanding. The agency is taking the following steps: a
                tape-recorded survey of native speakers; a textbook; a
                dictionary; a programme of cultural activity; and the
                development of formal academic courses. Unlike Foras na Gaeilge
                and its predecessor Bord na Gaeilge, the Ulster-Scots Agency has
                been in existence for only two and a half years, and it has made
                enormous strides.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency is an implementation body; it
                implements the policy determined by the Department in
                consultation with the House and through the North/South
                Ministerial Council. One of the next steps forward will be to
                focus and refine that policy, and the agency is ready for that.
                The Department should focus its policy drive on efforts to
                support and reinforce the work of the agency. That will be done
                in the same way as the Department has focused on policy for
                football, libraries and other areas. The &quot;future
                search&quot; process will begin in September and will be
                completed by Christmas. The Department will define work with the
                agency and ensure that each element feels some ownership of the
                process. In September the agency plans a forward surge in the
                implementation plan. The agency’s policy framework will be
                worked out in tandem with the implementation plan.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some time ago, Dr Adamson asked the Minister
                how many times the linguistic diversity branch of the Department
                of Culture, Arts and Leisure had met with the Ulster-Scots
                language groups. The Minister said that there had been five
                meetings. However, the Ulster-Scots Language Society wrote
                subsequently to the permanent secretary in the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure to seek clarification. The answer
                revealed that there had been no meetings with Ulster-Scots
                language groups. None of the five meetings that the permanent
                secretary identified, concerned language policy, which is the
                remit of the branch, and two of the meetings on the list were
                with the Apprentice Boys of Derry. Will the Minister acknowledge
                that he misled the Assembly and that there have been no meetings
                in the past year on the Ulster-Scots policy? Will he set the

                correspondence between the Department and that body. Mr Morrow
                makes a distinction between the language and the agency which is
                not clear. I will check the record for the quotations that
                concern him. The Member needs to be absolutely sure what he is
                asking about. For example, do his comments relate to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had a meeting in the Department around the
                end of June with the Ulster-Scots Agency and the Ulster-Scots
                Heritage Council. Several bodies are involved, and there is
                cross-membership. For example, Mr Nelson McCausland, of the
                Ulster-Scots Heritage Council, members of the Ulster-Scots
                Agency, including John Laird and others were present at that
                meeting. The meetings, and a large body of correspondence, are
                on the record. Those meetings are formal meetings that take
                place in locations such as Belfast city hall on a fairly regular
                basis. My special adviser and I attend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be helpful for Mr Morrow to note
                that the overarching policy is defined by the agreement and the
                Council of Europe Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.
                With regard to the Irish language in particular, the British
                Government signed up in the agreement to</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that the British Government have signed
                the Council of Europe Charter for Regional and Minority
                Languages, I take part II of that Charter to refer to Ulster
                Scots as well as the Irish language. Therefore, based on part II
                of the Charter and the agreement, the overarching policy for
                Ulster Scots also requires the Government to</p>

                in full. The Ulster-Scots language is a part of the
                constituency; it is by no means most or all of it, but it is an
                important part. I will work with Ulster-Scots activists as we
                refine the policy, seeking to use the plan for the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps Mr Hutchinson was not here for the
                previous answer. What do we mean by &quot;the language
                movement&quot;? Do we define it as the Ulster-Scots Language
                Society? Is it the Ulster-Scots Language Society with the
                heritage movement? Or do we define it as the whole Ulster-Scots
                language constituency, which is broadly represented through the
                Ulster-Scots Agency, our implementation body?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hutchinson should be aware that there is a
                sizeable constituency of native speakers who regard themselves
                as being somewhat marginalized by what they see as a
                middle-class, academic, Belfast-based, English-speaking wing of
                the constituency. It is important that the entire constituency
                be represented, and their views taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as honing and refining policy is
                concerned, policy is defined by those sections of the Belfast
                Agreement concerning rights, safeguards and equality of
                opportunity, and is carried through by the European charter.
                That is the overarching policy. Of course, it is proper and
                appropriate that we should look to refine that policy, and now
                is the time to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency has made enormous strides over the
                last two and a half years, and now is the time for another step
                forward. The way to do that is through a process that we have
                used in other sections and sectors of the Department: a
                &quot;future search&quot; process. I will look to further refine
                the policy in the autumn to allow the agency to implement it.

                pre-devolution were £118,000, and, post-devolution, we are
                projected to go to £1·6 million. We have increased the funding
                approximately tenfold. That is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not about money, however. We are
                often inclined to condense arguments and movements down to
                money. Ulster Scots is at a different stage of development
                vis-à-vis Irish. Foras na Gaeilge took over the old Bord ne
                Gaeilge; it took over the terminology committee, a publishing
                house and an education support movement. That was an advanced,
                sophisticated group that had been going for approximately 150
                years, 50 years in its current form. Ulster Scots is in a
                different situation; it is largely up to date and, with some
                exceptions, is primarily an oral tradition. We have been seeing
                Ulster Scots grow during the last two and a half years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong simply to say that because
                Irish gets so many million pounds, Ulster Scots should get the
                same. Under parity of esteem, which is equal respect, we will
                ensure that everybody gets equality of opportunity and equality
                of treatment and that funding will be according to need. Need is
                the key determinant factor. To date, the Ulster-Scots Agency and
                the Ulster-Scots movement have been funded according to need,
                and then some.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now take the next step forward and
                consider policy development. I welcome input from Mr Clyde, Mr
                Morrow and Mr Roger Hutchinson and their support for Ulster
                Scots as a language and a movement. I will ensure that they are
                invited to engage in the process, and they can put forward their
                ideas for developing the Ulster-Scots language and culture then.
                It is important that we refine the policy. That will have
                resource implications, and we will look at those in due course.
                Need is always the guiding principle. There must be equality of
                opportunity and equity of treatment in dealing with that need,
                and we must be guided by equal respect.</p>

                intrusive? Will the Minister also acknowledge that such concerns
                have been expressed directly to him, and will he comment on the
                basis of those concerns?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane, I must remind you and all Members
                that those questions are not related directly to the statement.
                For that reason, I will leave it up to the Minister whether he
                responds.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to respond to Mr Kane, who has
                shown an interest in Ulster Scots over the past two and a half
                years. I do not agree that the Department’s actions have been
                unhelpful and intrusive. The Department is here to support the
                agency, as it is here to support Foras na Gaeilge. They are
                essentially about running their own affairs and constituencies.
                We only step in if they ask for our help. There have been
                occasions over the past two and a half years when our help has
                been sought and has been readily given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are teething problems, to be expected
                in a new body. It has made progress, but we all accept that it
                has still some way to go. It has still to appoint a full-time
                chief executive — Mr ONeill asked about that earlier. That is
                a pressing need and has been for some time. It also has to get
                full-time staff. It has identified Raphoe for its office in the
                Irish Republic. It has offices on a short-term lease in Belfast,
                and it has to move forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will always be people who will say that
                something is unhelpful or intrusive. Mr Kane would not expect me
                to allow bodies to carry on doing exactly what they want without
                any overview. Mr Kane would complain if I were to do that with
                the Irish language, just as Mr McElduff would complain if I were
                to do that with Ulster Scots. There must be an element of
                accountability, not least for the resources that taxpayers are
                devoting to both those organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster-Scots Agency has made progress,
                and it has also made mistakes. It will continue to make
                progress, and I will support, reinforce and sustain progress on
                Ulster Scots.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster-Scots Agency and the Ulster-Scots
                Heritage Council have initiated the development of a strategic
                plan for Ulster-Scots culture, which will complement the
                existing plan for the Ulster-Scots language. That will bring
                together and build on previous work undertaken by both bodies
                and is due to be completed by the end of September. Will the
                Minister assure us that adequate resources will be secured to
                enable that plan to be implemented, and will he acknowledge that
                the differential between the funding of the Ulster-Scots
                language and culture and the Gaelic language and culture is
                discriminatory, is a breach of the equality agenda and cannot be
                sustained?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take the last point first. It is not
                discriminatory. One body is not funded according to the funding
                of another body — it is not the case that if Irish does well,
                Ulster-Scots does well; if Irish does badly, Ulster-Scots does
                badly. It is done according to need and to ensure that everyone
                is given the same equality of opportunity and has equity of
                treatment and parity of esteem, which is equality of respect.
                Everyone is given the same opportunity to go forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By Mr Hilditch’s argument, if the Irish
                body made a bad case for funding, Ulster Scots would suffer, and
                I do not accept that. Foras na Gaeilge is essentially the old
                Bord na Gaeilge, which has been operating in the Irish Republic
                for over 50 years, plus its constituent parts. In effect, there
                was a ready-made department, and the funding reflects that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster-Scots Agency began from a standing
                start. The funding that I have argued for and obtained for
                Ulster Scots is now 10 times what it was two and a half years
                ago before devolution. That is a measure of the benefits of
                devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster Scots, like Irish, benefits from the
                Belfast Agreement. The Belfast Agreement, through its references
                to Irish and the European Charter of Regional and Minority
                Languages, ensured that Ulster Scots was recognised formally for
                the first time as a language. The United Kingdom Government
                signed and ratified the charter last year. Ulster Scots is
                defined as a language under the European charter, and that is
                the end of the argument. Two and a half years ago there were
                arguments about whether it was a language.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is debate, argument and a bit of
                jostling in the Ulster-Scots constituency. However, it is
                important that those people who have carried the torch for so
                long make room for others who have an interest, not least the
                native speakers who sometimes feel that their movement, culture,
                heritage and tradition are being hijacked. I am anxious to avoid
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards policies for bodies such as the
                Ulster-Scots Heritage Council, they are free-standing
                organisations, so they can perform as they wish. I am
                responsible for the Ulster-Scots Agency, which implements
                departmental policy in consultation with the North/South
                Ministerial Council. Although it has performed that function, it
                has been concerned primarily with getting off the ground. I
                shall remind Members of some of its work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It aims to produce an Ulster-Scots textbook
                and to compile an Ulster-Scots dictionary, because neither
                exists at present. Those are glaring needs, but their absence is
                understandable, given that to date the language has been
                preserved through oral tradition. Its tape-recorded survey of
                native speakers will be important, because when native speakers
                die, we lose the language. The programme to develop cultural
                activities, making essential connections with the Ulster-Scots
                diaspora, is crucial also. Those projects are in the early
                stages of development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have highlighted to the agency the glaring
                need for capacity building in the Ulster-Scots constituency,
                because several groups have grown up but are not getting the
                support that they merit and require. They do not have sufficient
                skills, so they are unable to chase funding from the
                Ulster-Scots Agency or other bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding is available: the question is how
                much the agency is spending. There should not be an argument
                about money. There is an opportunity for the Ulster-Scots
                Agency, and Ulster-Scots as a movement, a people, a culture and
                a heritage, to develop rather than argue about money. As long as
                I am in the job, I shall ensure that there is parity of esteem,
                equal respect, equality of opportunity and equity of treatment.
                It is my job to ensure that those requirements are met.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an understatement to say that I am
                pleased that the debate on this profoundly important Bill is
                taking place. It has taken a good deal longer to bring the Bill
                to the House than we had hoped, but it is important that the
                Assembly begin to examine it before the summer recess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a significant initiative, so it was
                important to take the time to get it right. The credibility of
                this important public office would have been damaged if we had
                rushed through ill-prepared or inadequate legislation that would
                require amendments after a short period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill includes significant powers for the
                commissioner, so safeguards, checks and balances had to be
                introduced. It was difficult to obtain unanimous agreement on
                those provisions among the other Departments and the Northern
                Ireland Office. The Northern Ireland Office was concerned about
                the breadth and scope of the powers, especially the power of
                entry that we propose to give to the commissioner for children.
                We have managed, however, to ensure that an effective power of
                entry is included in the Bill and have secured the Northern
                Ireland Office’s agreement to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Departments, notably the Department of
                Education and the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety, had concerns about the Bill. Those Departments
                were concerned at the Bill’s wide scope of powers, which
                includes giving the commissioner discretion to investigate
                events from a child’s past. The Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister regarded it as essential that the
                commissioner should have that power because the abuse or neglect
                of children causes much emotional trauma, which takes time to
                resolve. A considerable time often passes before an individual
                makes his or her complaint to the appropriate authority. One
                cannot ignore the past, but the commissioner’s main focus will
                be on the present and the future.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The significance of the Bill is twofold.
                First, it is the most important piece of Northern Ireland
                legislation that affects children and young people since the
                Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. It is a watershed in
                society’s attitude to children and young people. It marks the
                point at which we move away from the traditional, yet narrow,
                focus on children’s welfare to a broader and more rounded
                appreciation of the importance of children’s rights and their
                best interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill is a clear demonstration
                of the value and effectiveness of the Good Friday Agreement and
                the institutions that stem from it. It is not a parity measure
                copied or imported from Westminster. It is a unique Northern
                Ireland measure that reflects local priorities that have been
                determined by the Executive and the Assembly. It has
                overwhelming support across the political spectrum and across
                the population of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Above all, the Bill is a measure that
                reflects the value that is placed on children, not merely as
                adults-in- waiting or adults-in-preparation, but as important
                members of society in their own right who have a valuable and
                enriching contribution to make. The Bill will place Northern
                Ireland ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom, and it would
                have been a long time before anything like this was introduced
                under direct rule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 29 January 2001, the First Minister and
                the former Deputy First Minister announced their intention to
                appoint a commissioner for children and young people for
                Northern Ireland as part of a wider children’s strategy. In
                that statement, they made clear their commitment to establish an
                office of commissioner that would place Northern Ireland at the
                leading edge of international best practice in safeguarding and
                promoting the rights and interests of children and young people.
                That was and remains an ambitious target, but the Bill will
                fully achieve what OFMDFM set out to do. We took some time to
                develop the Bill to ensure that we got it right and that it met
                those requirements and targets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is the result of a good deal of hard
                work. It is based on the outcome of comprehensive local and
                international research, as well as extensive deliberations with
                Departments, the Northern Ireland Office and a wide range of
                public bodies. I pay tribute to the small group of hard-working
                and hard-pressed officials in OFMDFM who carried the burden of
                this and worked themselves to a standstill to get the Bill to
                where it is today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other key factors helped to shape the Bill.
                The first of those was a comprehensive and innovative
                consultation process that brought together key stakeholders,
                including children and young people, to develop OFMDFM’s
                proposals in consensual partnership between the Administration
                and those who work with, are concerned with and are concerned
                for children. As a result of that process, OFMDFM issued more
                than 12,000 copies of the main consultation document and more
                than 250,000 summary leaflets in August 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We received requests for the documents from
                all over the world. Responses to the consultation came from a
                wide cross-section of opinion. We received some interesting and
                artistic impressions from three-and four-year olds of what the
                commissioner should be like. We also received well-thought-out
                and reasoned arguments from older members of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some children whom the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister consulted opined that the
                commissioner should be like Santa Claus. That raised a smile,
                but it was a serious comment. Those children wanted the
                commissioner to be a benevolent, kindly figure to whom they
                could look with confidence in order to get something of benefit
                for themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another child opined that the commissioner
                should be able to dance. That raised some smiles, but it was a
                serious comment. The child was saying that the commissioner
                should be in tune with youth culture and should know the things
                that are important to young people and the things that they
                enjoy and value. Another child opined that the commissioner
                should have red hair — I am still trying to work that one out,
                but, no doubt, we will find that it was also a serious comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that information helped to inform the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister’s
                thinking on the Bill. The consultation proposals received
                widespread support, and I thank everyone who responded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One aspect of the consultation was an
                outstanding success: in April 2001, the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister established a
                non-governmental organisation forum to give advice based on its
                expertise and experience of the issues affecting children and
                young people. The forum has proved an invaluable source of
                information and practical support, and I thank everyone who
                played a part in it. I also thank forum members for their
                support. I look forward to continuing the relationship during
                the pre-consultation exercise, which is already under way on the
                children’s strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other key input into developing the Bill
                was the work of the Committee of the Centre. I thank the
                Committee for its helpful and constructive contribution to our
                deliberations and, particularly, for its patience and
                understanding of the reasons for the delay in submitting the
                proposals. I also thank the Committee for its support for our
                work and objectives. The Committee invested time and effort on
                the subject, and it produced a comprehensive report that was
                instrumental in informing our proposals. Few, if any, of the
                Committee’s recommendations differ substantively from the
                proposals in the Bill. That is clear evidence of the value of
                the Committee’s role in policy development. I look forward to
                working in partnership with the Committee on the Bill and on
                other matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our main aims in the Bill are to provide for
                the following: first, a society in which children’s views are
                respected and in which their fundamental human rights are
                promoted, protected and upheld; secondly, a co-ordinated and
                holistic approach to children’s rights across all Departments
                and public authorities; thirdly, the active participation of
                children and young people on matters affecting them and their
                rights; and, fourthly, more effective ways for children and
                young people to obtain help if their rights have been denied or
                if they have been neglected or abused.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are five key features that must be
                reflected in the role and remit of the commissioner if we are to
                meet those aims. First, there must be a balance between
                independence and accountability. There must be independence, so
                that the commissioner can carry out his or her functions
                effectively, balanced by accountability for taxpayers’ money,
                which the commissioner will spend, and for the proper discharge
                of the important duties to be vested by the Administration in
                his or her office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the commissioner’s paramount
                consideration — and I stress the word &quot;paramount&quot;
                — must be the rights of children and young people. That will
                be the unique and defining character of the office of the
                commissioner, which the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister proposes to establish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the commissioner must have a broad
                remit that covers all children in Northern Ireland and every
                public authority whose activities affect children. Fourthly, the
                commissioner must have a comprehensive list of functions, with
                the flexibility to enable him or her to tackle the key issues of
                the day for children. Fifthly, there must be strong powers to
                make those functions effective, balanced by the appropriate
                safeguards, checks and balances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our proposals aim to reach those
                requirements. The Bill provides for appointment by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, with accountability to
                the Assembly through OFMDFM by way of annual reports and reports
                to the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, in day-to-day
                operation, the commissioner will be independent and free to
                determine his or her priorities with regard to his or her
                duties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill makes clear the main aim of the
                commissioner, which is to safeguard and promote the rights and
                best interests of children and young people, and sets out
                several guiding principles. Chief among those is the requirement
                that the rights of the child must be the commissioner’s
                paramount consideration. However, there are other important
                principles, including a requirement for the commissioner to have
                regard to the role of parents when deciding how best to carry
                out his or her functions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill proposes a comprehensive remit for
                the commissioner; it will cover all children and young people up
                to the age of 18, as well as young people up to the age of 21
                who are being looked after by, or are in the care of, a public
                authority. We have sought to ensure that the commissioner’s
                remit includes the full spectrum of public authorities. That
                includes authorities that are responsible for devolved and
                non-devolved matters, including juvenile justice. That was
                achieved following lengthy discussions with the Northern Ireland
                Office, principally on the safeguards to be included in the
                Bill. Those discussions resulted in an agreed position without
                any significant reduction in the range or application of the
                functions that we proposed to invest in the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill allows for a comprehensive,
                wide-ranging set of functions, more extensive than any exercised
                by any comparable body that we are aware of. Those include
                promoting the rights and best interests of children and young
                people; acting as a watchdog on public authorities; and
                ombudsman and advocacy functions. That set of functions will
                give the commissioner the flexibility needed to ensure that the
                rights and best interests of children are properly considered in
                situations ranging from individual cases to the development of
                policy and legislation. As a measure of the importance that we
                attach to these functions, many are proposed as statutory duties
                of the commissioner rather than merely optional functions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill sets out the powers at the
                commissioner’s disposal, and, once again, those are
                comprehensive. They range from general informal powers, whose
                use carries few restrictions, to more formal and robust powers
                that may only be used in a limited range of circumstances —
                that is with appropriate checks, balances and safeguards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the Bill allows for three types
                of investigation. First, there is a general informal
                investigation, which can cover any subject and has no set
                procedures. It does not involve formal powers to compel the
                production of evidence, and it has no specific remedy process.
                Secondly, there is an intermediate level of investigation, which
                may be used for certain commissioner functions. It requires set
                procedures to be followed and is remedied in the form of a
                notice and a naming-and-shaming procedure, but it does not have
                associated formal powers to compel the production of evidence.
                Thirdly, there is a full, formal investigation. That will
                involve the same procedures and remedy as for intermediate
                investigations, but in a formal investigation the commissioner
                will have similar powers to those of the High Court — to
                compel the production of evidence, legal power of entry and
                legal sanction against any obstruction.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The powers that have been proposed for the
                commissioner include more than simple investigative powers.
                Significant powers have been proposed in areas such as the
                investigation of complaints, the review of the arrangements for
                handling complaints, advocacy, inspection and whistle-blowing.
                That includes the handling of individual cases under such
                arrangements. Those powers will ensure that the commissioner can
                gain a comprehensive picture of how authorities deal with
                matters that affect children’s rights and interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also proposes to give the
                commissioner a key role in legal proceedings through providing
                assistance to children, bringing cases and intervening in cases,
                and also acting as an amicus curiae — a &quot;friend of the
                court&quot; or expert witness. In that respect, the proposals
                will give the commissioner significantly greater powers than the
                corresponding arrangements in the Republic of Ireland, Wales,
                Norway or any other international models that we considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members might think, with some justification,
                that the provisions that set out the commissioner’s powers are
                somewhat complex. The Bill that establishes the powers and role
                of the commissioner in Norway has one and a half pages of
                legislative proposals. The Northern Ireland Bill is much longer
                than that. Although we acknowledge that the Bill is longer and
                more complex, we believe that it is important to give the
                commissioner the full range of tools necessary to do his or her
                job effectively, ranging from the equivalent of a small
                screwdriver to a power hammer. That is what we have attempted to
                do in the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having emphasised the powers that would be
                available to the commissioner, it is also important to emphasise
                the safeguards, checks and balances that are built into the
                Bill. There are key provisions to ensure that the commissioner
                could not usurp the proper role of parents in safeguarding the
                rights and best interests of children; nor could he or she
                duplicate the role of existing statutory authorities. Other
                provisions would ensure that the commissioner could not act in
                both an ombudsman’s role and an advocacy role in the same
                case. That is necessary in order to maintain natural justice. It
                reflects the fact that an ombudsman’s functions must be
                exercised in a neutral fashion, whereas advocacy functions are
                not neutral, but are exercised on behalf of the child or young
                person. There are also provisions to ensure that the strongest
                powers — the power of entry and the power to compel the
                production of evidence — are used only when there are clear
                grounds for doing so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our proposals will establish an office of the
                commissioner for children and young people for Northern Ireland
                that will be second to none. It will make Northern Ireland the
                focus of international attention, which will bring it prestige
                and a reputation. By setting high standards with respect to how
                the state should protect and safeguard children, the
                establishment of the kind of office that is proposed will be a
                catalyst for progress and change in other jurisdictions. The
                Assembly owes it to children and young people to provide them
                with a commissioner who will help make a change for the better
                in their lives. The Bill is the tool with which to make that
                happen. I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to give a broad welcome to the
                Bill. I hope — as I believe the junior Minister implied —
                that it can, and will, demonstrate the benefits and difference
                that devolution can make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since time is limited, I want to concentrate
                on two areas of concern that relate to the remit of the
                commissioner. My first concern is whether the commissioner will,
                in practice, be sufficiently sensitive to the role, authority
                and rights of parents. There is strong evidence to show that a
                stable family background is arguably one of the most important
                impacts on a child’s welfare throughout his or her life. That
                was shown by the 1994 ‘Exeter Family Study’ and many other
                pieces of social science research.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are, of course, hundreds of thousands
                of families across Northern Ireland, but there will only be one
                commissioner. Therefore, it is vital that the commissioner does
                not cut across or undermine the good functioning of families or
                the relationships within them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that, according to clause
                2(3)(a) of the Bill, in determining the functions of the
                commissioner there will be regard to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the importance of the role of parents
                in the upbringing and development of their children&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I would have liked a more explicit
                balance between the rights of the child, on which the junior
                Minister spoke, and the rights and responsibilities of parents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that a tiny minority of parents
                abuse their children in some form or other, but we must also
                recognise that the vast majority of parents are good parents and
                want to be helped to be better. Therefore, I suggest a parents’
                forum to match the provision for a children and young people’s
                forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wonder why clause 2(1) talks of &quot;the
                rights and best interests&quot;, yet clause 4(1) mentions
                &quot;the rights or best interests&quot;. That may or may not be
                a significant difference. We want to be enlightened about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also consider the accountability
                mechanisms. Once the commissioner is in post, how will that
                person relate back to this House, and how can adequate
                democratic oversight of his or her functioning be ensured?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second concern on the remit of the
                commissioner centres on the definition of &quot;child&quot;. The
                preamble of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
                Child speaks of</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;safeguards and care, including
                appropriate legal protection, before and after birth&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is some recognition of that point in
                domestic law. For example, under section 25 of the Criminal
                Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 1945, it is an offence to
                intentionally destroy the life of a child capable of being born
                alive before it has an existence independent of the mother.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an abundance of evidence from health
                and scientific research that the mother’s diet during
                pregnancy has a crucial impact on the well-being of the child,
                both at birth and thereafter. Given that, I want the
                commissioner’s remit stretched to include provision of
                information to expectant parents, promotion of research on what
                encourages good fetal development, and general promotion of the
                health of expectant parents. Therefore, I urge that the
                commissioner’s remit include all children living in Northern
                Ireland, from before birth until the age of 18, or 21 where a
                young person has been looked after by the public authorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Subject to those qualifications, I support
                the Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill. We have been raising
                awareness of children’s issues in various debates in the past
                two days, and it would be remiss of me not to mention yesterday’s
                announcement by the Minister of Finance and Personnel on the
                children’s fund, and the positive effect that that will have
                on children and their families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am especially pleased to see that a
                rights-based approach has been adopted, and that the Bill draws
                so much from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. That
                is a demonstration of the high priority given to the care and
                protection of young people in Northern Ireland. Judging by the
                favourable public reaction, there can be little doubt that the
                Bill has been widely welcomed across the length and breadth of
                Northern Ireland as a positive step.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner in Northern Ireland can be
                seen only as an investment in the future of our children and
                young people. Children’s rights have for too long been
                overlooked in our society, and the commissioner will have a
                vital role to play in promoting and highlighting their rights
                and their best interests. I am particularly pleased that instead
                of &quot;welfare&quot; the term &quot;best interests&quot; was
                used. That term is right, since the commissioner must always
                seek to promote the best interests of the child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, it is vital that the
                commissioner helps children to cut through red tape and to find
                their way through the bureaucracy of public authorities. For
                that reason, I am pleased that the commissioner has the power to
                assist children and to provide advice in making complaints.
                Beyond that, an effective commissioner must have strong powers
                of investigation, together with the ability to uphold children’s
                rights. I am delighted that the commissioner will be given such
                powers. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister have
                made a commitment that the commissioner will be at the cutting
                edge of best practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill confers unparalleled powers upon
                the commissioner to bring proceedings on behalf of children,
                which is essential in protecting their interests. The
                commissioner is also empowered to conduct investigations — not
                just toothless ones, but real investigations with the power to
                call persons and papers, to enter premises and to seize
                documents. All those powers are necessary to ensure that
                children receive the protection that they deserve, and all of
                them are found in the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, I am pleased that the commissioner
                can name and shame public authorities that do not vindicate
                children and that do not place their rights and best interests
                to the fore. The commissioner’s powers, therefore, are greater
                than those of the Children’s Ombudsman in the South, of the
                Norwegian Commissioner and of any commissioner of whom I am
                aware. That clearly shows the emphasis that we in the North
                place on children’s rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us were concerned at the delay in
                introducing the Bill to the Assembly. The First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister have explained that the delay was caused,
                in large part, by negotiations with the Northern Ireland Office
                and with other Departments. What were the issues and how were
                they resolved? What consequences will the delay have for the
                Administration’s other work on the children’s commissioner?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner must work with children’s
                commissioners in other jurisdictions on child abuse and on
                protecting children from sex offenders. The children’s
                strategy was mentioned by the junior Minister and we look
                forward to its completion soon. It must be in parallel with the
                commissioner for children to provide a holistic approach and to
                reflect the willingness of the Executive to award priority to
                children’s issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The enhanced role of the new children’s
                commissioner, as set out in the Bill, will be pivotal in
                renewing confidence for future generations of our young people.
                It will integrate child-friendly policies and cross-departmental
                co-ordination into the structure of Government on issues that
                affect children. The all-party working group on children, of
                which I am a former Chairperson, carried out its own
                consultation in which 60 children from all backgrounds were
                brought together. The junior Minister mentioned size, height,
                colour of hair and how much a commissioner should be paid.
                Alongside those, many children wished that one young person be
                on the interview panel for the commissioner for children.
                Perhaps that could be taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I owe a debt of gratitude to all the children
                who were involved in the consultation and to all the
                organisations in the all-party group, including the Members, for
                their contribution to the consultation on the commissioner for
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel is
                meeting, and I apologise that I shall be unable to stay for the
                remainder of the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Bill.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the opportunity to debate the
                Bill.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our young people are our greatest resource,
                and, as a mother of three and a grandmother of two, I am
                committed to do all that I can to protect them. I welcome the
                idea of a commissioner as a champion for children; it is long
                overdue. However, I also recognise that many of us, in
                households across the Province, are champions for children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do, however, have some concerns about the
                Bill. I fear that the definition of a child offered in clause
                24(1)(a) is too narrow and ignores many children whose rights we
                must uphold. I am referring to unborn children — they too have
                rights:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the child, by reason of his physical
                and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care,
                including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after
                birth.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not only my opinion; it is a quote
                from the preamble to the UN Convention on the Rights of the
                Child. The commissioner’s remit should include all children in
                Northern Ireland from before birth to the age of 18.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is accepted universally that unborn
                children deserve protection at the mother’s workplace. If
                employees can be exposed to, for example, radiation, there is a
                legal duty on employers to provide information and training
                about health risks. Claims are taken against medical staff or
                third parties if a child injured in the womb is born with a
                disability. Cigarette packets carry warnings that smoking can
                damage the health of an unborn child. A mother’s diet during
                pregnancy can also affect a child’s health. Folic acid or iron
                deficiencies result in neural tube and brain defects. Lack of
                vitamins causes visual and skeletal abnormalities. A baby born
                at 40 weeks and weighing more than 2·5 kg is more likely to
                grow steadily and suffer less illness than others. Meanwhile,
                evidence suggests that heart disease, high blood pressure,
                obesity and diabetes might all be related to birth weight and to
                growth in the womb. Smoking is associated with smaller babies,
                miscarriages, infant death and illness and long-term learning
                difficulties. Toxic substances and chemicals affect unborn
                children. Examples include fumes from paint, insecticides and
                cleaning solvents. Caffeine and alcohol can also be dangerous.
                Foetal alcohol syndrome results in decreased growth and brain
                and facial abnormalities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those examples highlight areas in which a
                commissioner for children could prove effective in defending the
                rights of children, even before they are born.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2000, 93 children were stillborn in
                Northern Ireland, and 109 died in the first year of life. The
                cause given for almost half of the stillbirths was ill-defined
                conditions originating in the perinatal period. The commissioner
                should be able to take the lead in further investigation and
                research to prevent such deaths. He or she could advise parents
                when, for instance, a disability is detected during pregnancy.
                In that situation, information and support is invaluable from
                the moment of diagnosis. Members will recall the recent birth of
                conjoined twins across the water. Should a commissioner for
                children not be given input to assist in such trying
                circumstances?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to be hoped that those examples
                illustrate how important it is that a commissioner for children’s
                responsibilities extend to unborn children. It is important that
                we have a commissioner, and I do not want the Bill to fall.
                However, I believe strongly that the definition of a child must
                be broadened. I do not wish to amend the Bill now, but I
                encourage those involved to reconsider that issue before it is
                debated in the House again. I hope that changes can be made to
                reflect my concerns and those of many constituents. I shall
                monitor the Bill closely.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill’s introduction; it is a
                complex piece of legislation. Minister Haughey acknowledged and
                explained the delay, and he was perhaps too kind to those
                quarters that resisted the Bill’s coming to the House both now
                and previously. I seek assurances that there will be no further
                delay in the establishment of the office, which will pay a
                pivotal role in protecting our children’s rights and best
                interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party has consistently supported the
                establishment of the office of a commissioner for children that
                has all the necessary powers and resources to deliver fully all
                children’s rights, and to make a real difference to those
                children whose rights are denied. We welcomed the announcement
                by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on 29
                January 2001 that they had the Executive’s full support to
                appoint an independent commissioner. That would place the North
                of Ireland at the cutting edge of world practice on all our
                children’s rights, and Minister Haughey repeated that standard
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are concerned to note that the Bill fails
                to fully realise the opportunity to meet the world-standard test
                in protecting children’s rights and best interests. The Bill
                fails to afford equal protection to all our children; they
                deserve to be cherished equally, and all demand protection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, perhaps we have a special duty to
                protect the rights and best interests of those children who are
                in the state’s care. They are often the most vulnerable
                children. The children’s commissioner no doubt has the
                potential to be a strong champion for all our children.
                Unfortunately, it appears that children in the care of the state
                will not equally enjoy the commissioner’s protection under the
                Bill. Children in the justice system are specifically afforded
                less protection, because the onus is on individual children to
                identify themselves so that they can be protected fully by the
                office. If children are being violated or bullied, if their
                rights are being abused while in the state’s care, it is then
                unimaginable that they will expose themselves further by
                identifying themselves to the commissioner through an individual
                complaint. Therefore, the question remains whether there is
                redress for the young person in the justice system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fear that the abuse of children’s rights
                will be allowed to continue and will perhaps be extended to
                other children in institutions, such as those in the justice
                system. That is all the more poignant given that children whom
                society has already failed, such as those with disabilities and
                with special educational needs, are often over-represented in
                state care and the justice system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2001, the First Minister also
                emphasised the intention to establish an independent children’s
                commissioner. I note that the legislation provides for the
                commissioner to be appointed by the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. It is crucial that the appointment must
                be seen to follow an independent, transparent and accountable
                recruitment process that meaningfully involves children and
                young people to guarantee the independence of the commissioner’s
                office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, if we are to live up to
                international standards of best practice, we must ensure that
                rights and best interests are paramount considerations. That
                phrase must apply consistently in the Bill to all children.
                Members may return to the many resourcing issues later, but, as
                a member of the Committee of the Centre, I look forward to
                working with the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister to take the Bill to its conclusion. Ultimately,
                as Minister Haughey said, the commissioner will need the full
                range of tools to do the job, and it is crucial that the
                commissioner be truly accessible to all children, not sitting in
                splendid isolation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak on behalf of Mrs Eileen Bell, who
                unfortunately cannot be present. I know that she and others have
                done much work behind the scenes on this vital issue. Like all
                Members, we became frustrated at the delay in bringing the
                legislation to the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spoke to junior Minister Haughey at
                lunchtime, and he advised that protracted discussions with the
                Northern Ireland Office have contributed to the delay. The issue
                is of major importance to my party and me. When the structures
                for the Assembly were being created, we put forward, along with
                others, the idea of a junior Minister with responsibility for
                children. I am satisfied that the Bill goes a long way to deal
                with those issues. Junior Minister Haughey stated that the
                proposals are a unique Northern Ireland measure, and I welcome
                that. Once again it shows the importance of devolution to people
                in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this time, 18 countries have children’s
                commissioners — many countries introduced them in order to
                implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is
                difficult to make comparisons as they operate within different
                legal structures and have varying roles, so I appreciate the
                uniqueness of the proposals before us today. The UN Convention
                on the Rights of the Child, ratified in 1991, and the Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 must be the basis on which
                children’s rights are implemented and safeguarded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children are citizens in their own right, and
                the support of the children’s commissioner grows out of a
                framework for children’s rights, rather than being an adult
                duty. Children are uniquely in need of special measures to
                safeguard their rights due to their lack of power and the fact
                that they do not have a vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What also pleased me is that the junior
                Minister referred to the commissioner as &quot;he or she&quot;.
                The role of the commissioner is much more than a maternal one,
                and the commissioner’s support and powers to deal with
                day-to-day issues are vital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Executive to consider seriously the
                establishment of a children and young people’s forum to relate
                to the work of the commissioner’s office. That forum could
                play an important partnership role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monitoring, which is referred to in the
                proposed legislation, is important. However, the issue must be
                developed to show that the legislation will be effective and
                also to reflect the changing needs of society. The legislation
                deals with an equality issue, and each Department must attach as
                much, if not more, importance to that as to section 75 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>

                speak on what is, without doubt, an extremely important piece of
                legislation. It has been a long time coming, but, along with
                much of the legislation that is being rushed through on this,
                the penultimate day of the session, it is welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not need to remind Members that it was
                the Women’s Coalition that introduced the first, and so far,
                only, private Member’s Bill, recommending that Northern
                Ireland set up a children’s commissioner. I am glad to see
                that our initiative has helped to spur the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister into speedy action —
                that was the intention — although not as speedy as we would
                have liked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a historic and symbolic event. We are

                have all watched the television campaigns, organised by the
                National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
                (NSPCC), Barnardo’s, Fair Play for Children and Save the
                Children, that ask for help to prevent the abuse of society’s
                most vulnerable individuals. I take this opportunity to praise
                those organisations’ tremendous work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have attempted to raise our children in a
                society that has been torn apart by conflict. We have tried to
                raise them in such a way that their innocence, their enjoyment
                of life and their ability even to play are not taken away from
                them. It is the right of the child, as proclaimed in the United
                Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to live free from
                fear and to be able to have fun.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to studies by Save the Children,
                poverty has never affected so many children. That is something
                that we must tackle. Moreover, we heard this week about reports
                on sectarianism from the University of Ulster that show that
                children as young as three-years old are affected by the hatred
                in our society. A champion for children has never been more
                essential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The welfare of all children must be protected
                and promoted. That is why we need a children’s commissioner,
                and I welcome the Bill for that reason. I wish that I could say
                that the legislation is as extensive and potentially effective
                as that which inspired it. Unfortunately, I cannot. Phrases
                spring to mind such as &quot;in name only&quot; or
                &quot;toothless tiger&quot;. Perhaps those words are too strong,
                but the legislation lacks some of the essential powers that we
                would like to see introduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested to hear the junior Minister
                talk about the steps in the procedure, from informal
                investigations to naming and shaming and on to full, formal
                investigations. Although we are aware of the need to respect the
                role of the parents, I am slightly concerned that the children’s
                commissioner’s wings could be clipped. There may be so many
                checks and balances on the full, formal investigative powers
                that people will not come forward. It is good that the
                commissioner may have similar powers to those of the High Court,
                such as the ability to compel evidence to be presented. However,
                on what occasions can such powers be used? I am worried that the
                checks and balances do not ensure that the interests of the
                child are the priority that they should be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I was reading the Bill, I thought that
                there might be a page missing, because, without enforcement
                powers, the children’s commissioner will not have as much
                credibility or clout as he or she should have. That may be
                because, during the consultation process, which was very
                valuable and to be welcomed, enforcement powers were not really
                offered as an option. That is a shame, because an important
                opportunity to provide the children of Northern Ireland with a
                real champion who has real powers and real teeth is being lost.
                Instead, they are being offered someone who may not even have
                the proper authority to defend their rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interests of children must be promoted,
                and we want to ensure that that is done. They cannot be replaced
                by good intentions that are diluted to produce legislation that
                sounds good but translates into little more than a title. We
                want to ensure that that is not the case. The Bill is
                inconsistent on what children are entitled to. The &quot;rights
                and best interests&quot; of children are mentioned in some parts
                of the Bill, but not in others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some instances, children’s welfare
                rather than their rights are referred to. Will the junior
                Minister clarify the difference between welfare and rights? I am
                concerned about the differential treatment of children in the
                criminal justice system whereby some do not enjoy the same
                rights as others. What are the junior Minister’s views on
                that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill provides for the commissioner for
                children and young people for Northern Ireland to be appointed
                by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The
                Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition hopes that that appointment
                will take place after a proper, independent and transparent
                consultation. We believe firmly that the views of children and
                young people should be taken into account in the process. During
                the event at Stormont at which children’s advice was sought,
                the proposal emerged that a young person should be on the
                interview panel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday’s interview on ‘Stormont Live’
                with Peter Clarke, the Welsh Children’s Commissioner, was
                interesting, because it showed that the position was created as
                a result of the Waterhouse Report on child abuse but was
                extended to incorporate other factors. Those include the
                opinions of children and young people on schools, taking tests,
                bullying and how adults treat them socially, all of which we
                should take into account. It reminded me that children do not
                feel respected by adults; they feel that their voices are not
                being heard. I remind the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister that children must feel some ownership of
                the office of their commissioner. It is their commissioner, and
                they must feel that he or she will represent their views fairly
                and accurately. Children must have power to make people take
                account of their opinions and feelings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few concerns about the Bill were raised
                with the Women’s Coalition. One related to the need for
                joined-up government to ensure that, although the children’s
                commissioner and the children’s strategy are to be the dealt
                with by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, the responsibility of other Departments will not be
                diluted or reduced. Each Department must retain huge
                responsibility for its aspect of work — it should not be
                handed over to others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns were raised about the costs to
                non-governmental organisations (NGOs) of implementing the
                legislation. What sanctions will be placed on accredited
                childcare organisations if they fail to report or carry out
                suitability checking as required by the Bill? It is important to
                clarify the role of NGOs. We must remember that the Bill will
                help to protect children only in the context of improved
                practices and good multi-agency co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition will
                not withdraw its private Member’s Bill until it is convinced
                that the Executive’s proposals have been strengthened to take
                into account some of those factors.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to have an input to
                the Bill, because the office of the children’s commissioner
                will have a significant impact on the lives of children. Clause
                2 states that the principal aim of the commissioner will be to
                safeguard and promote the rights and best interests of children
                and young persons. Nobody could disagree with that noble
                aspiration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is well known that the nine months a child
                spends in the womb affect his or her well-being for life. That
                is recognised through the obligation on cigarette companies to
                attach Government health warnings to cigarette packets. However,
                the Bill does not recognise properly that children’s rights
                must be protected before birth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be futile to safeguard children from
                physical harm after birth, if they have already have been
                seriously harmed in the womb. If the children’s commissioner
                is to fulfil the function of safeguarding and promoting the
                rights and best interests of children and young people, the
                rights of unborn children must come within his remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children are among the most vulnerable people
                in society. Recent child abuse cases have been witnessed on a
                large scale that show how vulnerable they are. We must not
                overlook the fact that many children are carers themselves —
                minors looking after minors, or young people looking after an
                ill or disabled parent or grandparent. The Commissioner for
                Children and Young People Bill must reflect on these harsh
                realities and seek to lighten the load where it is heaviest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like the Bill and the
                commissioner’s role take into account the unique difficulties
                in Northern Ireland. For more than 30 years, children have been
                manipulated by paramilitaries and have been used to do their
                dirty work. Punishment beatings have mostly been carried out on
                children and young people. The children’s commissioner’s
                role must be to tackle some of these terrible, daily human
                rights abuses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Services for children should be overseen and
                monitored by the commissioner. Children in care have often been
                viewed as easy targets, especially in their most vulnerable
                state. I hope that the Bill will rectify that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the commissioner will safeguard
                those rights to education that are recognised by the United
                Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Powers should be
                available to combat bullying in schools and play areas and to
                promote the right to quality education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not lose sight of our aim to protect.
                Seeking to empower children by making them more independent is
                no substitute for a loving, safe environment. Childhood is all
                about children developing into adults, and this growing stage
                must be protected. A healthy family environment is vital for the
                healthy development of children. The commissioner will only be
                one office, whereas family units exist across Northern Ireland.
                The family unit will continue to be the most important factor in
                the lives of young people and children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 2(3) places an obligation on the
                commissioner to have regard for the importance of the role of
                parents. I welcome that provision, and I hope that it will be
                upheld in every decision taken by the commissioner. No attempt
                must be made by this or any other piece of legislation to
                undermine the vital role carried out by parents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to every child’s benefit to be
                disciplined when deemed appropriate so he can be guided in the
                right way.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the commissioner should be able to
                distinguish between parental discipline carried out in a loving
                way and physical violence that amounts to nothing less than
                abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recognised that children thrive through
                the love and support of family life. I hope that the office of
                the children’s commissioner can complement the positive
                influence that a family unit has on bringing up children. The
                new commissioner’s office must demonstrate an understanding of
                all the needs of children — physical, mental, emotional,
                social and spiritual.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to that, the office should
                express a commitment to promoting the rights of the disabled,
                perhaps the most vulnerable of young people. Children must be
                allowed to be children as they learn to grow up to be adults.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome warmly the Bill’s introduction,
                which will establish a children’s commissioner in Northern
                Ireland. The Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety recommended the appointment of a children’s
                commissioner to act as a watchdog and promote and protect
                children’s interests in its inquiry into residential and
                secure accommodation for children in Northern Ireland. Some
                witnesses believed firmly that this would be the most important
                initiative to benefit children, especially those in care and
                leaving care.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to the various
                contributions and I am grateful to Ministers Haughey and Leslie
                for introducing the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mrs Iris Robinson about the
                protection of the child in utero — before birth. Billy
                Armstrong also referred to that. I will not go into a detailed
                analysis of that debate other than to say that after conception
                a baby is genetically complete. Nutrition is the only extra
                thing needed to aid development. Members know all the arguments
                about 22 weeks and 28 weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also agree with Iris Robinson about the
                commissioner for children. My Committee has put a lot of work
                into that, and the Bill can be amended later. However, I support
                that 100%, and many members of my Committee also do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister Haughey made comments about
                respecting children’s views. The whole question of human
                rights, the rights of the child and the unborn child and the
                participation of young children in matters that concern them are
                paramount.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Committee produced a report on
                children in care and in secure accommodation. Its main
                recommendation was the appointment of a commissioner for
                children. There are two key points in the Children (Leaving
                Care) Bill that are relevant to the children’s commissioner:
                the personal advisers and the care pathway. Personal advisers
                will be appointed by trusts for children or young people leaving
                care. Even if a young person goes to live in another part of
                Northern Ireland, or possibly elsewhere, his personal adviser
                will have direct responsibility for him. A personal adviser
                cannot take the place of parents, but that is the intent. The
                care pathway is a pathway for a young person who has been in
                care going through the education system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intelligence of a child starting school
                at the age of five is based on his or her genetic makeup, and
                there is nothing that can be done about that. However, the
                environment that a child grows up in also affects his
                intelligence. Members will agree that a child growing up in a
                large, poor family that cannot afford healthy eating, and in
                which some members of the family smoke, is at a gross
                disadvantage compared to a child of the same age from a
                healthier environment whose parents are better off. Those points
                must be taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of recent cases highlighting abuse
                of children by those entrusted with their safety and protection
                was instrumental in our Committee’s decision to conduct an
                inquiry into the state of child protection services in Northern
                Ireland. Those cases fully vindicate the strong investigative
                powers that it is proposed be vested in the commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to all the childcare
                organisations that lobbied so effectively for a campaign for
                children, to all who contributed to the extensive consultation
                process and to Ministers Haughey and Leslie for introducing the
                Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee of
                the Centre (Mr Gibson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this important and long-awaited
                Bill. The First Minister and the Deputy First Minister announced
                it in the Assembly on 29 January 2001. Its intention is to
                appoint a commissioner for children in Northern Ireland. The
                announcement has been welcomed by Members from all sides of the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals were welcomed as a step towards
                ensuring that children can grow up in a society in which they
                are safe from exploitation and abuse, in which their rights are
                protected and in which their needs are met and their
                responsibilities are known by themselves and their parents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the announcement, the Committee of the
                Centre undertook a comprehensive inquiry to examine the role of
                a children’s commissioner. In June 2001, the Committee
                produced a report setting out several detailed recommendations.
                In the course of the inquiry, the Committee listened to more
                than 13 hours of oral evidence and questioned 51 individuals
                representing 26 organisations. I pay tribute to all those
                organisations and individuals, because they made their points
                sincerely and were obviously people of commitment and
                dedication. Those organisations included many statutory and
                voluntary bodies. We also heard the views of young people, and
                we invited representatives from Wales and Norway to tell us of
                their experiences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee concluded that there was an
                overwhelming case for appointing a commissioner for children,
                and it supported calls from the organisations consulted that a
                commissioner should be appointed as soon as possible. The
                Committee’s report called for a strong, independent
                commissioner who could look into all aspects of children’s
                lives and be a champion for them. A commissioner should, as it
                was described to the Committee, have a &quot;helicopter
                view&quot; — he should be able to see the big picture. By
                having that overview, the commissioner would be able to draw
                attention to problems, gaps and lack of proper co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was also clear that the
                commissioner should have a wide range of powers to investigate
                complaints, initiate inquiries, subpoena witnesses and compel
                disclosure. The Committee concluded that the commissioner must
                be able to support children in court cases or initiate cases, if
                necessary, on their behalf. However, the Committee was equally
                clear that although a commissioner needs powers to initiate or
                to intervene in legal proceedings, such powers should only be
                used strategically when all other means have been exhausted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee felt strongly, and was
                supported by the witnesses, that the role of the commissioner
                must extend to reserved matters. The commissioner must be able
                to ensure that the rights of children in the juvenile justice
                system are protected and that they can call on him if necessary.
                The Committee was pleased to note that most of the
                recommendations in its report were reflected in the model for a
                commissioner that the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister consulted about last September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More importantly, however, the Committee
                welcomes the inclusion of those recommendations in the Bill. The
                Committee acknowledges that the Department has faced a difficult
                and complex task in getting the Bill to this Stage; it
                recognises that many provisions of the Bill cut across the
                remits of several Departments. That necessitated negotiation and
                agreement with other Ministers. The Committee welcomes
                particularly the inclusion of provisions to ensure that the role
                of a commissioner will extend to reserved matters. The Committee
                recognised that this was a major hurdle for the Department, and
                it supported the Department in its negotiations with the NIO to
                achieve that goal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering the details of the Bill, we
                must not lose sight of what we are trying to achieve. In the
                course of our inquiry, we heard many shocking and dramatic
                statistics about the plight of some of our most vulnerable
                children. Particularly, we heard about the children who at birth
                were described as being &quot;destined to fail&quot;. The
                appointment of a children’s commissioner is a first and
                crucial step towards breaking that cycle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to see a commissioner who will be
                universally recognised as a champion for all children, someone
                who will have a high profile, be easily recognisable and
                accessible to all children, wherever they live or whatever their
                circumstances. The Committee of the Centre will consider the
                provisions of the Bill in detail to ensure that it results in
                such a champion for children. It will seek and listen to the
                views expressed in the House and from interested organisations
                and individuals. Views expressed in the Chamber seem to fall
                under broad headings. There will be an examination of the role
                of the commissioner in relation to parents and the family. The
                rights, best interests and welfare of children will also be
                addressed, as will the rights and responsibilities of parents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner’s accountability has not
                been mentioned today, but it must be critically examined. Who
                will the commissioner report to? Who will he be accountable to?
                Terms such as &quot;relevant body&quot;, which is sometimes used
                loosely in legislation, must also be defined. It must be made
                clear who the specific relevant bodies are. The care of unborn
                children was also mentioned forcibly in the debate. Those areas
                will be scrutinised by the Committee of the Centre, and it will
                note its concerns before the final presentation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The greatest gift to children is to show them
                how much they are loved and enable them to enjoy a good, stable,
                secure and loving home background.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The completion of the Bill involved wide
                consultation that included a substantial inquiry by the
                Committee of the Centre, of which I am a member. The report into
                the proposal to appoint a commissioner for children in Northern
                Ireland was comprehensive and thoughtfully considered. It took
                into account the expert advice and opinions of groupings as
                diverse as the Law Society of Northern Ireland, Voices of Young
                People in Care, the Northern Ireland Guardian Ad Litem Society,
                the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the Derry
                Children’s Commission. There were also contributions from
                legislative bodies, social workers, charities, the Equality
                Commission for Northern Ireland and many children’s
                organisations and steering groups that already act as a voice
                for children in the voluntary sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Added to that extensive body of local
                knowledge was the voice of the Norwegian Children’s Ombudsman
                and the chairperson of the Health and Social Services Committee
                from the National Assembly for Wales. The Norwegian Government
                have had a Children’s Ombudsman since 1981, the first European
                country to have one. The lessons that they have learnt in those
                21 years, and the pro-active approach that they have adopted
                because of their experience, were of immense value when drawing
                up the Bill. The National Assembly for Wales was the first
                Government in the United Kingdom to appoint a children’s
                commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Defining the terms of appointments,
                resources, roles and responsibilities and the duties and powers
                to be available to the commissioner has been crucial. Other key
                areas of the commissioner’s remit include independence, good
                practice, interfacing and accountability. The Bill is a welcome
                addition to the further protection of children and young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner will be appointed jointly by
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. He or she will
                act as a champion for children. It is not intended that the
                commissioner will usurp the role of parents or duplicate or take
                over the functions of other agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initially, the appointment will be for four
                years, with an option to renew. The maximum term will be eight
                years. The commissioner will keep under review the workings of
                the legislation and make reports to the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, who will in turn report to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The children’s commissioner will act as an
                advocate for children’s rights and monitor those rights in
                Northern Ireland. He will be the voice of young people and a
                champion for all young children.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal aim of the Bill is to safeguard
                and promote the rights and best interests of children and young
                persons. The commissioner will have a duty to create and promote
                new and innovative opportunities for young people to make their
                views heard. That could include working through schools, youth
                clubs and other forums, and involve the use of information
                technology.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another key responsibility, which is crucial
                to the success of the role, is the proviso that the commissioner
                should work to improve the means of communication with children
                and young people through, for example, the promotion of language
                that young people understand, without jargon and formality. It
                is vital that children feel that they have somewhere to turn
                when they have an issue that they cannot discuss with parents or
                carers. It is also important that they receive clear answers and
                assurances that they are being heard. The western young people’s
                steering group made the point that the commissioner must be
                easily accessible, physically and mentally, so that young people’s
                minds are relaxed. The only way to do that is to communicate in
                a direct and equal manner that does not intimidate or confuse a
                child, especially one in an already vulnerable position.
                Therefore, it was necessary to ensure that the role of the
                commissioner was clear, unambiguous and transparent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Norwegian Children’s Ombudsman related
                to the Committee details of Powerline, which exists for children
                in his country. It is not a hotline or a helpline, rather it is
                a service whereby children can discuss injustice or things that
                they would like changed. The Commissioner told the Committee
                that proposals to change legislation arise and that the material
                comes into the office for analysis, and it is responded to
                through the Internet channel. Again, that may be a useful tool
                to employ here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre proposed that the
                interview panel should include young people, as happened in
                Wales. The Committee recommended that the children’s
                commissioner should have adequate powers to investigate
                complaints or to initiate investigations or inquiries in respect
                of any aspect of children’s rights, where other avenues of
                redress have failed. As the Ombudsman for Northern Ireland
                pointed out, there would be a legal problem if the children’s
                commissioner determined complaints rather than investigating or
                supporting the complaint. However, the Ombudsman also highlights
                concerns regarding the potential for fragmentation, for example,
                in the commissioner’s office and other bodies such as the
                courts, should the commissioner have too many powers. Therefore
                the important part of the Ombudsman’s recommendation is that
                the powers be employed where other avenues of redress have
                failed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner’s main job will not be to
                upset the legislative apple cart, but he will need to have some
                course of action available to him where the normal procedures
                and systems have failed a child and further action is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill recommends that the role of the
                commissioner should be to monitor the co-ordination of services
                between organisations that have a role in ensuring children’s
                rights in all organisations, including public authorities. I
                agree that the definition of &quot;a child&quot; should also
                include those in utero. In other words, the child should be
                protected from before birth. The Bill recommends that the
                commissioner should be independent of all existing organisations
                and public bodies. That is in line with proposals put forward by
                virtually all the organisations that gave evidence to the
                Committee of the Centre. That has been assessed in line with
                section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The Committee of
                the Centre agreed that the commissioner should receive adequate
                resources to carry out the role. Many organisations that gave
                evidence to the Committee felt that if the necessary resources
                were not forthcoming, the limited resources allocated would be
                wasted and a vital opportunity missed. However, the financial
                cost has been estimated. It will be £1 million with ongoing
                annual costs projected to be in the region of
                £1·9&nbsp;million. I welcome the introduction of the Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a member of the Committee of the Centre,
                so I have a particular interest in the issue, and I have
                contributed to the work along with other members of the
                Committee. The evidence that children need a commissioner for
                their protection is not a requirement — it is a necessity.
                Someone needs to be officially on the side of children to give
                them the protection and the voice they need. The Bill seems to
                deliver that: it addresses some of the most important issues
                that parents fear, especially that someone unsuitable, with a
                past history of abusing children physically or sexually, would
                gain employment in schools, churches and youth organisations.
                The safeguards suggested in the Bill go some way to ensuring
                that that never happens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as with everything, the safeguards
                must work. It instils fear into the heart of every parent, after
                the catalogue of priests, church officials, youth workers and
                even activists for child protection who have been discovered
                abusing children and carrying out their deviant agenda while
                working with children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill must ensure that those who wish to
                work with children are vetted. We must go further to ensure
                worldwide protection for children so that jurisdictions and
                departmental boundaries cannot be used as excuses to fail our
                children. In the case of Victoria Climbié that aspect proved
                fatal as doctors, social workers and police all felt that it was
                someone else’s responsibility to act on the evidence of abuse.
                Little Victoria died because of petty matters of jurisdiction.
                It is also a convenient way to evade prosecution. People
                protecting children must get their act together and decide
                definitively that there are no boundaries when it comes to
                protecting children; they must help one another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is too convenient that some priests and
                church officials can hightail it to a diocese in America when
                parents in Northern Ireland guess that something is amiss. Those
                men — if we can call them men — are protected by the Church
                and are given carte blanche to re-offend elsewhere, and that is
                despicable. The Bill must address that issue as strongly as
                possible. I welcome the new whistle-blowing procedures as a way
                forward in addressing that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that those working with children
                are vetted and have references that will be held on a central
                register. The Pre-Employment Consultancy Service register must
                be on a statutory base, and it should have a list of people
                prohibited from working with children so that child-centred
                businesses can assure parents that their children are safe. Even
                those who run voluntary childcare services must be legally
                obliged to check their workers and register them. That will
                ensure that no matter where our children go we will know that
                they are with registered workers who are not convicted abusers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be advantageous if convicted child
                abusers knew that they would be breaking the law when they
                applied for a job working with children and that they could be
                punished severely by the courts. The protection of our children
                must be the highest priority no matter where they are or what
                they are doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rights of the unborn child should be
                addressed in the Bill, and so far they have not. My Colleague,
                Iris Robinson, spoke about that, as did Joe Hendron. The
                preamble of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child quotes
                the Declaration of the Rights of the Child defining child
                protection as:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;special safeguards and care, including
                appropriate legal protection, before as well as after
                birth&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what we should be aiming at. If the
                United Nations has safeguarded the rights of children before
                birth, the Northern Ireland Assembly should do likewise. To
                date, the rights of unborn children have not been safeguarded in
                Northern Ireland, as unborn twins could not be officially
                counted among the roll of those murdered by an IRA bomb in
                Omagh. Whoever causes the death of an unborn child cannot be
                prosecuted for murder, yet the crime is as real as the murder of
                you or me. The parents will mourn just as long, and possibly
                harder, for the child that they did not get to know or see grow
                up. That is just one tangible reason for protecting the rights
                of the unborn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protecting the child before birth would
                ensure that unborn children have a voice in medical issues. The
                commissioner could ensure the best medical care for children,
                even if they are unborn. It would mean that unborn children are
                protected from toxic substances that their mothers may work
                with, and employers would have to preserve the health and the
                job of the mother in the interests of the child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As each child is unique and special, each
                child holds the same fundamental value, and it is priceless
                beyond our wildest imagination. We must protect children against
                all dangers, whether medical, terrorist or sexual.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Greater protection from all dangers needs to
                be legislated for and improved so that bureaucracy and
                inactivity cannot fail children any more. Every child needs to
                be protected, even those to whom we cannot speak as yet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are the adults. We can make a difference.
                Let us start by ensuring that the legislation is perfect and
                without loopholes that those with a subversive attitude could
                use to their advantage. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the
                Centre (Mr Poots):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to the speeches
                and comments that have been made. I welcome the Bill. The
                Committee of the Centre will scrutinise it closely. The
                Committee may make amendments to the Bill once it has heard
                others’ opinions, and I guarantee that there will be full
                consultation. I assure those Members who have raised concerns
                that the Committee will take their views on board and will seek
                to incorporate them into the Bill through amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the concept of a champion for
                children. However, I suggest that in most cases children’s
                champions are their mums and dads. I would like to think that
                that is the case in my own home. I believe that it is the case
                in most homes around the Province. Unfortunately, however, some
                children’s mums and dads are not their champions. Often,
                children are brought up by either their mum or their dad, with
                the other parent absent. In those cases, only one parent can be
                their champion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often, one or both parents are involved in
                activities that are not conducive to a stable family
                environment. Perhaps there are drink or drug problems in the
                home, or a parent has had to go jail because he or she has
                become involved in crime. Those are cases in which children’s
                parents do not act as champions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also cases in which a child’s
                parents become separated, and a stepfather or stepmother comes
                on the scene who uses the vulnerability of the single parent to
                engage in paedophile activity. Once again, the child does not
                have a champion in the home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that in the vast majority of cases
                the champions of children will be their parents. However, a
                children’s commissioner is needed for those children who do
                not have a parent to be their champion, or whose parents have
                let them down. That is where the role and remit of the children’s
                commissioner must be concentrated. It must not be focused on
                prying into homes in which there is a good, stable family
                relationship where the child is loved and well cared for. The
                role of the commissioner must be to protect those children who
                are vulnerable and in need of protection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adults often think that they know about
                children’s issues, whereas children and young people have a
                completely different concept of what those issues are. When the
                Norwegian Commissioner was in Northern Ireland, one of the key
                issues for children was that of school uniforms. I am not
                referring to what Members might think of as school uniforms, but
                to Nike shoes, Nokia phones and Reebok T-shirts. That was an
                issue for children whose schools had done away with school
                uniforms, and whose backgrounds were such that they could not
                afford to wear the labelled T-shirts, trainers, jeans that the
                other children were wearing. Perhaps adults would not have
                identified that as an issue. However, young people did.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commissioner said that Norwegian
                politicians thought that it would be a good idea to reduce the
                age of consent. He asked young people what their views were.
                Those young people, particularly young girls, were opposed to it
                and the legislation was stopped. That was further evidence of
                adults thinking that they knew the issues affecting children and
                young people. Let us listen to what children and young people
                want — perhaps some things that adults impose upon them are
                not what they want.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members spoke on many issues,
                including the rights of parents and the extension of the
                legislation to cover unborn children. At least five Members
                talked about the definition of &quot;child&quot; and how it
                needed to be extended. I assure those Members that the Committee
                of the Centre will fully consider and examine the possibility of
                having the legislation amended, which will require the
                co-operation of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a somewhat confused speech, Jane Morrice
                talked of the commissioner lacking powers. I am not sure whether
                it is appropriate for the same person to both investigate and
                decide the outcome of a case, which was a point that Ms Morrice
                made. She then expressed concern that non-governmental
                organisations might be fined if they did not meet the
                commissioner’s requirements. On the one hand she was seeking
                more powers for the commissioner, but on the other hand was
                concerned that the commissioner’s powers might damage some
                organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice said that the legislation had only
                been introduced because of the pressure of the private Member’s
                Bill tabled by the Women’s Coalition. Without delving too much
                into that somewhat facile point, it should be made clear for the
                record that the current Bill was proceeding before that private
                Member’s Bill was brought forward. Mrs Eileen Bell and I had
                previously tabled a motion in the House to appoint a children’s
                commissioner, which the Executive had taken into account and,
                when the motion was debated, indicated their intention to
                initiate a Bill. The Women’s Coalition’s private Member’s
                Bill came along some time after that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfair to say that the Executive and
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                are enacting the legislation on the basis of that private Member’s
                Bill. However, we look forward to addressing all those issues
                and hope that the Bill will go part of the way to reducing the
                widespread problems and bad experiences that many children and
                young people face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we cannot eradicate all the
                problems, we can do everything possible to ensure that the
                problems that children and young people face are as small as we
                can make them. Whether that is done through legislation or
                through a children’s commissioner, we want to give them as
                much protection as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Junior Minister (Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister) (Mr Leslie): </b>I thank
                Members for their thoughtful contributions. I listened carefully
                to them all. I also thank many Members from all sides of the
                House for their support for the proposals in the Bill. As my
                Colleague, Denis Haughey, said at the start of the debate, the
                Bill offers a marvellous opportunity to establish a commissioner’s
                office that would be a world leader in protecting the rights and
                best interests of children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is only the beginning. Appointing a
                commissioner does not absolve Government and society of their
                responsibilities towards children and young people. The next
                goal must be to promote a culture of respect for children’s
                rights that permeates every aspect of society and a system of
                governance in which consideration of the rights, interests and
                views of children and young people is second nature, not second
                choice. That requires more than appointing a commissioner. It
                will require us to respect the commissioner’s office and
                respond with diligence and imagination to the commissioner’s
                recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have learnt a great deal in the process of
                developing our proposals. We have learnt the value of taking the
                necessary time to have a comprehensive and inclusive
                consultation process. Some have argued recently that there is
                too much consultation. We may need to change the way in which
                consultations are conducted. The emphasis could possibly be
                shifted away from written documents towards active dialogue with
                key shareholders. However, under no circumstances must we lose
                the immense value that those consultations have. We have sought
                to do that with this Bill, and our proposals are much the better
                for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also seen the value of an exclusive
                partnership approach. Once again, like my colleague Denis
                Haughey, I pay tribute to the work of the non-governmental
                organisations forum. The forum complemented the work of the
                various Departments, providing a synergy that greatly benefited
                the process. In particular, the expertise of forum members
                allowed us to involve children and young people of all ages in
                the development of proposals and in the subsequent consultation
                in a way that otherwise would not have been possible. Lessons on
                the value of close co-operation with social partners can be
                applied more widely across Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We appreciate greatly the Committee of the
                Centre’s commitment to the initiative, and we look forward to
                working closely with the Committee during the consideration of
                the Bill. Most of all, we have seen the value and potential of
                the Executive and the Assembly. We set ourselves the ambitious
                target of leading the way on children’s rights, and we now
                have the means to achieve that target. The Bill is clear
                evidence that we have a governmental system that delivers on key
                local issues, and that we have the political capacity and
                maturity to make the system work effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall respond to as many as possible of the
                specific points made during the debate, and any points to which
                I am unable to respond will receive a written answer. I shall
                start at the end and thank Mr&nbsp;Poots for his thoughtful and
                measured contribution, in the course of which he answered
                several of the points that were raised in the debate. I am
                grateful to him for that. In particular, Dr&nbsp;Birnie, at the
                start of the debate, raised the issue of whether there might be
                a risk of the commissioner’s activities conflicting with the
                rights of the children. Mr&nbsp;Poots focused on what the
                commissioner’s emphasis should be, and an underlying point to
                remember when seeking a commissioner is that the person
                appointed must understand clearly that exceedingly important
                balance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Assembly that our proposal aims
                to complement and not to oppose the rule of parents in
                protecting the rights and best interests of their children. I
                emphasise that it is not a zero-sum gain issue: recognising and
                upholding the rights of children does not detract from the
                rights of parents. There are two specific safeguards. First, as
                Dr&nbsp;Birnie noted, in deciding whether and how to exercise
                functions, the Bill specifically requires the commissioner to
                have due regard to the importance of the role of parents in the
                upbringing and development of children. Secondly, the
                commissioner is obliged to have regard to the relevant rights in
                the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The role of
                parents is central to the Convention, as evidenced in
                article&nbsp;5, which states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;States Parties shall respect the
                responsibilities, rights and duties of parents&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope, therefore, that Members will agree
                that the proposed role and remit are not in any way inimical to
                the rights and responsibilities of parents or to the
                contribution made by family life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members raised issues that relate to
                the rights of the unborn child. Those Members, in particular
                Dr&nbsp;Birnie and, earlier in the debate, Mrs&nbsp;Robinson,
                made points about providing information to expectant mothers. At
                this stage, we do not propose to extend formally the
                commissioner’s remit to include the unborn child. Legislation
                exists on the matter and we do not intend to change that. It
                would have been inappropriate to legislate on that matter
                without full and careful consideration of the complex and
                sensitive issues involved. Because the issues are complex and
                sensitive, the amount of time taken might have held up the
                appointment process to an extent that would not have been
                sensible. The issues involved turn on both civil and criminal
                law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only would it cut across several
                Departments, it would include reserved matters. European
                jurisprudence does not define the extent to which article 2 of
                the European Convention on Human Rights, which addresses the
                right to life, applies to unborn children. The European Court of
                Human Rights gave member states a wide margin of discretion on
                that matter in order to reflect the wide variation in the laws
                of member states. However, clause 3(2) of the Commissioner for
                Children and Young People Bill makes provision to review the
                adequacy and effectiveness of the law relating to the rights of
                children. The commissioner could decide to consider that matter
                and to make recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Iris Robinson’s points about
                information and research on factors that affect the health of
                unborn children. The commissioner may seek a role in those
                important matters, but the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety is primarily responsible and exceedingly
                active in that area. That is not to say, however, that we should
                not seek further activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie asked about the accountability of
                the commissioner. Annual reports will be published, so the
                commissioner’s activities will be scrutinised in the Assembly,
                especially by the Committee of the Centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie referred to a parent’s forum. The
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                recognises the importance of ascertaining the views of parents,
                and the commissioner will decide how parent’s views should be
                elicited. The Parents Advice Centre and Homestart, which are
                non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that work with parents,
                are members of the NGO forum and have ensured that, in drafting
                the Bill, we were cognisant of parents’ views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley asked whether the commissioner
                would work with his or her counterparts in other jurisdictions.
                In schedule 1, the Bill empowers the commissioner to co-operate
                with</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;other bodies exercising functions
                relating to children and young persons (whether in the United
                Kingdom or elsewhere)&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We thought that it was important that that
                power be included explicitly in the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley also asked what implications the
                work of the children’s commissioner would have for the
                children’s strategy. We are committed to developing a
                comprehensive children’s strategy and, as with the proposals
                for the children’s commissioner, the consultation process will
                begin with the involvement of key stakeholders and other
                interested parties to develop the proposals for more formal
                consultation in spring 2003. Our focus hitherto was on bringing
                the Bill to the House. Having achieved that, we can move with
                more expedition to the children’s strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We intend to involve children and young
                people in the appointment process. We are establishing a young
                people’s advisory forum, which will self-select 12 to 14 of
                its number to assist with our work. Those selected will receive
                special support and training to enable them to participate in
                the appointment process. They will help to draw up the job
                specification and the personal specification and will
                participate in the interview process. Young people were involved
                in the appointment process in Wales, and we will consult with
                Welsh officials to determine what useful lessons we can learn
                from that and then tailor the process to our circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members referred to the time that it
                has taken to finalise the Bill and to the negotiations between
                Departments and with the Northern Ireland Office. We were
                attempting to legislate for a commissioner with a broad range of
                functions, covering a wide canvas, and, therefore, there were
                many interested parties.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner’s comprehensive set of
                functions and powers covers our aims. The Bill gives the
                commissioner a broad remit, including juvenile justice, a
                reserved matter that could not be included in the Bill without
                the Secretary of State’s consent. As a result, long and
                detailed discussions with the Northern Ireland Office on the
                scope of the Bill’s provisions and the necessary safeguards
                were required. I am pleased that those discussions culminated in
                an agreed position without watering down the proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to Mr McElduff’s question, the
                timing of the commissioner’s appointment will depend on the
                Bill’s progress through the Assembly Stages, but we hope to
                fill the post by early next year. Preparatory work on the
                appointment procedure will begin very soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Neeson that the UN Convention
                on the Rights of the Child is important. That is why the Bill
                specifically requires the commissioner to have regard to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to consulting young people and
                the creation of a forum, clause 3 imposes a duty on the
                commissioner to seek the views of children and young people on
                the exercise of his or her functions. The commissioner will
                decide the precise mechanism for doing that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice asked about the use of the terms
                &quot;welfare&quot; and &quot;rights and best interests&quot;.
                The inclusion in the Bill of &quot;best interests&quot; reflects
                the terminology of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
                However, the term &quot;welfare&quot; must be used where the
                Bill refers to existing bodies of law that use that term. That
                is particularly applicable to clauses 10 and 11, because the
                term &quot;welfare&quot; is commonly used in legislation on
                related matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice also questioned why the children’s
                commissioner and the children’s strategy were the
                responsibility of the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister even though the issue cuts across other
                Departments’ responsibilities. She answered her own question:
                it is precisely because the issues cut across several
                Departments’ activities that it is appropriate that the centre
                Department should be responsible for them. The Office of the
                First and the Deputy First Minister will lead the Executive in
                setting the strategic direction and vision. However, that does
                not mean that other Departments are not involved — they
                clearly are, and we will work with them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the commissioner’s powers,
                he or she will have the necessary tools for the job. The
                commissioner is not there to replace the police or the social
                services authorities and so does not need those agencies’
                powers. He or she will have the power to take legal proceedings,
                but the primary purpose will be to change how public authorities
                interact with children. Where possible, that will be best done
                through collaboration and the dissemination of good practice.
                The commissioner will also have significant powers to
                investigate authorities and to recommend changes in policy,
                practice or law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the concern about the
                commissioner and parents, I emphasise that the focus is on
                aspects of children’s lives in which parents play no part, and
                that is for sound reasons. It will be difficult for authorities
                to ignore any recommendations that the commissioner may make.
                Departments and the Assembly can deal with the matter if public
                authorities respond inadequately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The safeguards in the Bill will not hamper
                formal investigations. The test to be met as a condition to
                exercising the stronger powers contained in the Bill will be
                whether there are reasonable grounds for carrying out an
                investigation. I am sure that Ms Morrice would not object to
                that as a criterion, because it is common in legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I echo Mr Poots’s surprise that Ms Morrice
                did not tell us that, in view of the introduction of this Bill,
                the Women’s Coalition would be withdrawing its Bill. I ask
                Ms&nbsp;Morrice and her Colleague, Ms McWilliams, to reflect on
                a few matters, such as how much consultation went into the
                wording of their Bill, what their Bill says about the
                appointment and accountability arrangements of the commissioner
                and what special functions and powers are included? Given the
                cross-departmental interest, the Northern Ireland Office
                interest and the issue of reserved powers, is Ms Morrice
                confident that her Bill will achieve the degree of agreement
                that we have achieved with those bodies in our Bill? I trust
                that the Bill being read today will receive widespread support
                and that the Women’s Coalition will, on reflection, withdraw
                its Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the comments of the Deputy
                Chairperson of the Committee of the Centre, Mr&nbsp;Gibson. In
                the Bill, we reflected the proposals that the Committee of the
                Centre produced as a result of its consultation, and we are
                grateful to the Committee for all the information it provided.
                The differences are slight and may be matters of degree or
                emphasis rather than fundamental policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill makes it clear that the commissioner
                will be accountable to the Assembly through the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and to the
                Comptroller and Auditor General by means of annual reports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon raised the need to ensure that
                child abusers could not gain access to children through
                employment. I agree with Mr Shannon on this key issue. However,
                that matter is not addressed in this Bill; it is addressed in
                the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Bill, which was
                introduced by the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That deals with matters raised by Members; if
                I have left any out, I will ensure that Members receive a
                written reply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will finish with the words of one of the
                many children and young people who responded to the consultation
                paper. One young man put it very simply, as young people often
                do:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This commissioner had better be good or
                this is all a waste of time&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can assure that young man that the
                commissioner will be good, and, judging by the provisions for
                commissioners elsewhere, ours will be the best children’s
                commissioner Bill on the statute books.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                This is the first Bill to be brought before the Assembly on
                matters relating to schools and the first piece of primary
                legislation on this matter since the Education (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is set out in four parts and
                contains three schedules with consequential and supplementary
                amendments and repeals. The most important issue in it is the
                allocation of funds for the local management of schools (LMS). I
                will take the opportunity to include provisions on other
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, the main purpose of
                the Bill is dealt with in part 1, which contains enabling
                provisions to allow the Department to introduce a single common
                funding formula for the calculation of schools’ budgets for
                all schools funded under local management of schools
                arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local management of schools was introduced
                here in April 1991. There are seven different LMS formulae in
                operation. Five of those are operated by the education and
                library boards — one by each of the boards. Those formulae are
                applied to all controlled and maintained schools in each board
                area. The remaining two formulae are operated by the Department
                of Education. One is for the voluntary grammar schools, and the
                other is for grant-maintained integrated schools. Although the
                formulae have many common features, there are differences in the
                factors used and in the values attached to them. There are also
                significant variations in the relative size of the budgets that
                they distribute. As a result, schools that are similar in size
                can receive quite different levels of resources, purely because
                their LMS budgets are calculated under different formulae.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have stated on several occasions, and I am
                sure that Members agree, that it is indefensible, inequitable
                and nonsensical to have seven different LMS formulae for the
                allocation of resources to schools. I am committed to the
                introduction of a single common funding formula to ensure that
                schools with similar characteristics receive similar levels of
                funding, regardless of the area or sector in which they are
                located.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principle of a common funding formula has
                already been agreed by the Executive and is an objective of the
                Programme for Government. It received widespread endorsement in
                the major consultation exercise that I undertook last year and
                is supported by the Committee for Education. Although the
                make-up of the formula has yet to be agreed, there is general
                agreement that there should be a common formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 1 to 7 of the Bill will enable the
                Department to introduce a common funding scheme to prescribe the
                formula to be used, how each factor is to operate and the values
                or tariffs to be applied to each. The Bill will also provide the
                Department with the power to require education and library
                boards to adopt a common funding scheme. That scheme will be
                made up of two elements: the formula itself; and the
                arrangements for access to resources, held centrally by each
                education and library board for controlled and maintained
                schools and by the Department for voluntary grammar and
                grant-maintained integrated schools. This two-tier funding
                arrangement is a continuation of current practice, but a single
                formula will be used instead of the seven currently in use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My proposals for the formula were the subject
                of a detailed, public consultation exercise that lasted for
                almost six months in 2001. In addition to more than 600
                responses to the consultations, I received a very helpful report
                from the Committee for Education. Having regard to that report
                and the comments that I received during the consultations, I
                have written to the Committee setting out my proposals for the
                formula. I look forward to further discussions with the
                Committee on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resources held centrally provide each
                funding authority with a budget from which it allocates
                additional resources to schools for certain purposes, such as
                assisting with substitution costs when a teacher is absent for a
                specified time or helping with the costs of providing additional
                support to a pupil with a statement of special educational
                needs. Significant progress has been made over the past few
                years towards harmonising the arrangements for the distribution
                of these funds, and there are unlikely to be any substantial
                changes in this area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1 of the Bill also sets out
                arrangements for consultation on the scheme. I expect that, as
                is the case with the existing LMS schemes, the common funding
                scheme will need to be revised periodically, not only in the
                light of experience of its operation, but to take account of
                schools’ changing needs. Therefore, it is important that all
                those affected by the funding scheme can put forward their views
                on the need for revision and the implications of that. The
                arrangements proposed in the Bill will provide for this ongoing
                consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill retains the provision set out in the
                Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 whereby responsibility
                for funding voluntary grammar and grant-maintained integrated
                schools will transfer to the education and library boards. This
                will be accomplished by means of an appointed day procedure,
                which I do not intend to initiate until the outcome of the
                review of public administration is known. The main reason for
                this transfer is that there is little logic in having a
                different funding source for less than 10% of schools. The
                funding of these schools, alongside their controlled and
                maintained counterparts, will simplify the operation and ensure
                greater transparency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The common funding scheme provides safeguards
                for funding voluntary grammar and grant-maintained integrated
                schools. Members will welcome these provisions, as they will
                remove the inequalities in the current system of funding our
                schools. I stress that nothing in the arrangements for the
                common funding formula will prejudice or pre-empt any decision
                about the most appropriate structures for post-primary
                education.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving to the rest of the Bill, I am taking
                this opportunity to include a range of other provisions on
                education matters. Many are amendments to existing legislation,
                and the need for the majority of these has been identified over
                time. None is of sufficient significance to justify primary
                legislation in its own right. I do not propose to comment on
                each of the provisions, but I will outline some of the issues
                addressed. Of course, I will be happy to respond to Members’
                questions on the other clauses at the end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part II of the Bill contains provisions
                relating to how the five education and library boards will
                receive and account for resources allocated to them by their
                funding Departments. I should explain that although the bulk of
                the resources received by the boards comes from my Department,
                the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department
                for Employment and Learning pay other amounts for certain
                services provided by the boards. For example, the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure funds the public library service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the most part, these new provisions are
                technical changes required as a result of Government financial
                accounting’s moving from cash to an accrual basis. However, I
                want to draw Members’ attention to those provisions that will
                formally introduce best value in the five education and library
                boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Labour Party came to power in 1997,
                it gave a commitment to replace compulsory competitive tendering
                (CCT) with a new duty of best value in the delivery of public
                services. At that time, my Department introduced subordinate
                legislation to suspend the operation of CCT provisions for
                certain specified education and library board services until 31
                March 2003. New arrangements need to be put in place before this
                period of suspension of CCT comes to an end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am proposing in this Bill to introduce a
                best value regime in respect of services provided by the
                education and library boards and to revoke fully the CCT
                provisions of the Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland)
                Order 1993. These actions are provided for in clauses 11 and 14
                of the Bill respectively. The five education and library boards
                operate best value principles on a voluntary basis, but this
                part of the Bill provides a statutory basis for best value. The
                boards will be required to make arrangements for continuous
                improvement in the way in which they carry out their functions,
                having regard to economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has no wish to increase the
                burden on the boards by prescribing how they should carry out
                their duty in this regard. It is for the boards to decide for
                themselves. However, in deciding how to carry out their duty, it
                is important that they consult those who use, are likely to use
                or, indeed, have an interest in the services provided by them.
                The Bill provides for such consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Article 20 of the 1993 Order specifies a list
                of non-commercial matters that should not be taken into
                consideration by an education and library board when awarding
                contracts for the supply of goods, materials or services. Such
                non-commercial matters include the terms and conditions of
                employment of a potential contractor’s workforce and the
                country or territory of origin of supplies to be used in meeting
                the contract.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 12 of the Bill provides my Department
                with powers to make subordinate legislation, subject to a draft’s
                being approved by the Assembly, amending this list in the
                interest of promoting other key policy issues. That will allow a
                balance to be struck between avoiding discriminatory practice in
                awarding contracts and ensuring that all relevant matters are
                taken into consideration. That replicates the approach adopted
                in the Local Government (Best Value) Act (Northern Ireland) 2002
                and the equivalent legislation in Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To ensure that boards can deliver their duty
                of best value, provision is included in clause 13 of the Bill to
                enable my Department to make an Order to remove any obstacles
                preventing or obstructing boards from complying with their
                statutory duty in this regard or, if necessary, to give
                appropriate powers to boards to ensure that they can comply with
                their duty of best value. However, before any proposed Order is
                laid formally before the Assembly for approval, my Department
                will advance an explanatory document containing details of the
                draft proposals together with details of consultations that have
                taken place on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In determining how we would implement best
                value in the boards, I have had regard to the provision of the
                Local Government (Best Value) Act (Northern Ireland) 2002.
                Therefore, the approach that I have taken is similar to the way
                in which best value will apply in local government here. My
                Colleagues, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the
                Minister for Employment and Learning, support this proposal for
                the services provided by the boards for which they have
                responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, in part III of the
                Bill I plan to introduce several provisions that are concerned
                directly with children’s protection and welfare. In clause 15
                I propose that the duty of care, which is already placed on a
                school’s board of governors in respect of pupils who are
                boarders under the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, be
                extended to include all pupils who attend the school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, my Department has power to
                direct a board of governors to comply with a duty set out in
                education legislation. I seek a further power extending this to
                include the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 duty of care
                in respect of pupils in boarding departments. This will mean
                that should an inspection of facilities in a boarding department
                identify weaknesses that place pupils at risk, action can be
                taken by my Department to direct improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the most important provision in this
                part of the Bill is clause 16. It will introduce a requirement
                for all grant-aided schools to have a written child protection
                policy and to make a copy of the policy available to parents.
                While I am assured that, as a matter of good practice, all
                schools have a child protection policy, there is a widely held
                concern among those engaged actively in promoting the safety of
                children that reliance on good practice in such an important
                matter is insufficient. Other Members and I share that concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, clause 16 will impose a duty on
                boards of governors to ensure that there is a child protection
                policy at their school and that it is implemented. Furthermore,
                it will require that, in preparing the policy, schools must take
                account of guidance provided by my Department, the boards and
                the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS). This will
                ensure that school policies are kept up to date and are based on
                the most recent advice available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 17 contains another significant
                provision. It will require schools to address the problem of
                bullying through their discipline policies. I have told the
                Assembly on several occasions of my intention to make this a
                requirement for schools. Members should note that for the first
                time here the legislation includes a requirement for schools to
                consult with pupils when developing their anti-bullying
                policies. This development is entirely consistent with our
                broader agenda to create an inclusive society. It will allow
                young people to participate actively in forming strategies to
                tackle a problem that directly concerns them. I am confident
                that the involvement of all pupils — those who are bullied,
                those who bully and those on the sidelines not knowing what to
                do — in the development of an anti-bullying culture will
                improve considerably the chances of tackling effectively this
                most pernicious and persistent problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, this part of the Bill
                also contains several other provisions, some of which I will now
                outline. First, clause 20 contains a new power to allocate
                places in special schools to children from the South of Ireland
                or other jurisdictions for an appropriate charge. This will
                maximise the use of our special schools and allow the needs of
                more children to be met. The provision will also make it clear
                that places can only be offered to non-resident children if they
                are not needed for local children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, in clause 21, I propose to
                introduce a new power to make regulations to enable the
                Department, in exceptional circumstances, to remove from office
                all voting and co-opted members of a school’s boards of
                governors. However, it would not apply to the school principal,
                who is a non-voting member. It is expected that the use of this
                power will arise only rarely. It is designed to deal with
                circumstances in which a school is failing to provide an
                adequate education for the children, and the Department is of
                the view that the entire board of governors, either through its
                actions or inactions, is contributing in whole or in part to
                that failure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before a decision is taken to remove a board
                of governors, consultation will take place with the appropriate
                body, such as the local education and library board or the
                Council for Catholic Maintained Schools. Arrangements will also
                be made to advise and consult with the board of governors
                concerned about the decision and for any representations to be
                considered. Appointments to the board of governors are made by a
                range of bodies, and the new powers will allow those bodies that
                have authority to nominate individual representatives to a board
                of governors and to remove and replace their individual
                representatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 22 will make it a statutory
                requirement that the person or body representing the school
                should consult with the board of governors, teaching staff and
                parents before the publication of a development proposal. Such a
                proposal is a statutory process, which is required when a school
                authority wishes to make a significant change to the education
                provision in a specific area — for example, a school closure
                or the amalgamation of two or more schools. The clause will
                ensure that all relevant interests are consulted fully about
                such changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In support of the initiative to ease the
                bureaucratic burden on schools, a provision will be introduced
                in clause 25 to allow the Department to consult a representative
                sample of schools, rather than all affected schools, before
                making regulations about provision of information on pupils and
                school performance targets. That will not affect the right of
                any school to express a view on any consultation, and all
                schools will continue to be notified that consultation exercises
                have been initiated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four of the provisions in part IV of the
                Bill, clauses 27 to 30, will reduce or remove entirely the need
                for education and library boards to seek the approval of my
                Department on certain administrative matters. Clause 32 will
                allow education and library boards to make arrangements for
                education to be provided by an institution of further education
                for certain pupils, such as expelled or disaffected pupils who
                are over 14 years of age and not on a school register. There is
                already provision in existing legislation for the education of
                pupils at Key Stage 4 on link or work-related courses that are
                provided at further education colleges rather than at schools.
                This proposed change would extend that provision for an
                estimated 200 pupils each year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 34 will amend legislation introduced
                in 1987 to make corporal punishment unlawful in all schools,
                including the small number of independent schools here, and also
                in settings where education is provided other than at a
                mainstream school. That will bring the legislative provisions
                here into line with those in Britain, following a decision of
                the European Court.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the Bill is to introduce
                a common formula for calculating school budgets. That will
                remove the inequities in the present system, and the Assembly
                will welcome that commitment. The detail of the common funding
                scheme, including the formula, has yet to be finalised. I hope
                to work closely with the Committee for Education over the next
                few months on that important task.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remainder of the Bill deals with a range
                of issues, some of a technical and minor nature and others of
                importance for young people. I have not covered every provision,
                but I have focused on those that are the most important. I shall
                be happy to respond to any points raised by Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Education (Mr Kennedy):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In broad terms I welcome the Education and
                Libraries Bill. My Committee members are looking forward to the
                Committee Stage. The Committee appreciated the fact that
                officials from the Department of Education attended a recent
                meeting and briefed members on the purpose and detail of the
                Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to keep my comments brief, because
                it is important that the Committee for Education considers the
                Bill in great detail. The Committee expects to be given the
                opportunity for full and appropriate consideration of the Bill,
                and would be concerned were there to be a request for
                accelerated passage.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister has said, the Bill’s
                primary purpose is to provide enabling power to introduce a
                single common formula to calculate school budgets for all
                schools under local management of schools (LMS) arrangements.
                However, the Minister has confirmed that the Bill will not
                prescribe that formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee expects that any new LMS
                arrangements would have to have widespread support and carry the
                Committee’s endorsement. I seek an assurance from the Minister
                that he will ensure that that consensus is worked for and
                achieved, and that he will not attempt to force his own
                proposals into the new arrangements. As in most matters, the
                devil is in the detail, and the Committee will expect to see the
                details and to be in a position to approve them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Education strongly believes
                that the current situation, in which schools in different
                sectors but with identical characteristics receive varying
                budgets, is neither satisfactory nor equitable. Therefore, we
                welcome the introduction of a common funding formula for
                grant-aided schools. The Committee spent a great deal of time
                examining in detail the proposals for a common formula for
                grant-aided schools. It produced a comprehensive report that
                included several key recommendations. We anticipate that those
                recommendations will form the basis of the new funding
                arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the outcome of any changes
                will impact on the amount of money that every school in Northern
                Ireland will have to spend on providing the best education for
                our children. Therefore, we shall wish to give detailed
                consideration to the relevant clauses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part II of the Bill deals with the financing
                of boards and the duty of best value. That is an opportunity to
                place the present voluntary application of best value to
                education and library board services on a statutory footing,
                which is to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part III of the Bill includes provisions for
                the Department to remove a school’s board of governors. It is
                the Department’s intention to invoke that power where it is
                convinced that it would be in the best interest of the school.
                However, that would be a court of last resort and should be
                viewed as such. The Committee looks forward to scrutinising that
                area in detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those provisions of the Bill that require
                schools to have a written child protection policy and an
                anti-bullying policy reassure the Committee. Those policies will
                serve to strengthen the rights of children. All Members will
                agree that the welfare of our children is of the utmost
                importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Additional clauses that involve the abolition
                of corporal punishment will undoubtedly arouse interest and much
                debate, not least in the independent school sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the Minister’s attention — and he
                referred to this in his opening remarks — to the need for a
                cohesive approach, not only with regard to the local management
                of schools common funding formula, but also the proposals and
                possible implementation which will arise from the outcome of the
                Burns Report and the curriculum review. It would be nonsensical
                to move forward on any of those proposals in isolation of the
                other important issues. They are all interlinked, and good
                common sense determines that to make progress we must be aware
                of the structural, financial and curriculum implications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Education looks forward to
                considering the Bill and examining the clauses in detail. It is
                committed to conducting a detailed scrutiny, and it intends to
                consult widely and take evidence from interested parties. The
                Committee will want to examine the detail of the proposals —
                not just the generalities — and it will want to be satisfied
                that there is a strong consensus in the Committee, the Executive
                and the Assembly for new proposals when they are brought
                forward.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Education (Mr S Wilson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although many of the provisions in the Bill
                are necessary tidying-up measures which reflect changes that
                have occurred in the education system, some of the issues are
                insidious and Members should be concerned about them. The Bill
                should not be allowed to go through in its totality or without
                significant amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 1 to 7 deal with the funding of
                grant-aided schools and the common funding scheme. The Minister’s
                proposals have already caused considerable opposition, some from
                right across the board. There has been consultation, but the
                Bill makes it clear that it will be up to the Minister to
                determine what goes into the common funding formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1 goes through the consultation
                process. It is important to remember — as the Chairperson said
                — that the contents of the Bill affect the fairness of moneys
                available for the education of children in all school sectors in
                Northern Ireland. Clause 1(8) proposes that following all the
                consultation:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Department shall then—</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(a) adopt the scheme (with or without
                modifications); and</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(b) publish the scheme.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 11 then states that it will be the
                duty of each board to implement the scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that there is already a degree of
                suspicion about the scheme as presented by the Minister and
                since on many occasions he has ignored the outcome of
                consultation and turned his back on the views of the Assembly
                and the Committee for Education, I am not happy about enabling
                legislation that allows him to implement, without first having
                presented it to the Assembly, a scheme which Members have not
                yet seen and which they will not be required to approve,
                according to the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a very dangerous way to proceed. I
                suspect that the enabling legislation was proposed because the
                Minister knows that parts of his scheme will be unacceptable to
                elements in the Assembly. A well-aired concern is the favourable
                treatment that he proposed and that was recommended by a small
                minority to whom, I suspect, the Minister will pay great heed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister proposes to provide additional
                funding for Irish-medium education. If he adopted some of the
                recommendations of the Irish-medium sector, youngsters at those
                schools could receive nearly £1,000 more funding than pupils at
                controlled or maintained schools. That is one reason why the
                controlled and the maintained sectors opposed the scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could give other examples, but we are not
                discussing the common funding formula. I wanted to illustrate
                why Members should not empower the Minister to implement a
                scheme for which there is a consultation process that the Bill
                enables him to ignore. I have grave concerns about the current
                Minister of Education, but I would not want to grant that power
                to any Minister. Major decisions such as funding are crucial to
                schools’ ability to carry out their functions. Members should
                not give a carte blanche to the Minister as regards school
                funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that clauses 1 to 7 do not remain in
                the Bill. I have no difficulty with legislation to enable the
                Minister to introduce a common funding formula scheme that has
                been seen and agreed. However, I will not take a leap of faith
                by believing that the Minister will do the decent thing. The
                scheme must be seen and agreed. It will be important that the
                Committee for Education address clauses&nbsp;1 to 7 in great
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not imagine that anyone opposes the
                imposition of a duty on boards of governors to safeguard and
                promote the welfare of pupils. However, Members must be clear
                about the implications. Given the onerous duties and burdens on
                boards of governors, it is often difficult to get people to
                serve on those bodies. They now have financial responsibility
                for schools, and that burden increases daily, especially given
                schools’ funding deficit. Now we are to impose on boards of
                governors the duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of
                pupils registered at the school at all times, either when they
                are on the premises or in the lawful control or charge of school
                staff. What does that mean? What are its implications?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If youngsters go on a school trip and
                something happens, such as the tragic accident in France last
                week, which may be due to negligence of an individual, will the
                board of governors be legally responsible? If school procedures
                break down and a child is injured, will the boards of governors
                be held responsible? If so, it will be even more difficult to
                serve on a board of governors. The Committee ought to be teasing
                out the implications of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 16 (2) goes even further. Part of the
                child protection measures is that abuse</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;includes sexual abuse and abuse causing
                physical or mental harm to a child.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The board of governors is responsible for
                that, but how far does it go? It is a catch-all. If a youngster
                is under pressure at exam time, is that a form of mental abuse?
                Is the board of governors responsible for schools pushing
                youngsters too hard or pushing them over the brink? I do not
                know. However, those questions must be answered because a board
                of governors consists of people who give up their time for no
                remuneration. They ought to know that they are not placing their
                livelihoods in jeopardy by legislation that is vaguely worded
                and is therefore a lawyers’ paradise or which may even be
                designed to put more responsibility on the boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 17, which the Chairperson of the
                Education Committee mentioned, refers to school discipline
                measures to prevent bullying. Some may think it ironic that the
                Minister of Education is concerned about bullying. I will not go
                down that route, although I could speak for quite a while on it.
                Our response is to present more paper documents. School policies
                on bullying will not solve the problem. Schools can write all
                the fanciful documents they wish, but that does not deal with
                the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools and teachers must have effective
                sanctions to deal with bullies. Ironically, clause 34 abolishes
                one of the sanctions that teachers had to deal with classroom
                bullies. Schools will not be permitted under any circumstances
                to use corporal punishment. On one hand, it is foolish to say
                that we will tackle these problems — and teachers complain
                about that all the time — and on the other hand remove the
                means for teachers to tackle them. I notice that a few Members
                of IRA/Sinn Féin are laughing at that. One of the actions
                strongly advocated by IRA/Sinn Féin for dealing with bullies in
                the ghettos that it controls is corporal punishment administered
                with nail-studded baseball bats. Nevertheless, they seem to
                think it funny that we ask for powers of corporal punishment to
                be available to teachers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Part IV of the Bill, clause 32 deals with
                the provision of secondary education for pupils by institutions
                of further education. I understand why some schools might
                welcome that. However, I also envisage difficulties because of
                the way in which the system currently operates. Unless there are
                good reasons for a youngster who is under the age of 16 to be
                educated somewhere other than at school, he or she cannot be
                educated in a college of further education, although that can
                happen when local arrangements have been made. The Bill may
                simply be designed to regularise that. Many colleges of further
                education welcomed the fact that they no longer had to take in
                GCSE students. However, colleges with falling student numbers
                may welcome back those students.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing must be made clear. If a board
                arranges for secondary education to be provided by an institute
                of further education for youngsters who are registered at Key
                Stage&nbsp;4 and who are over the age of 14, the grounds on
                which that can be done should be specified. There will be all
                kinds of difficulties for boards and schools, such as when
                parents who are in despair about their child — or youngsters
                who are unhappy at school — put undue pressure on the board to
                move them to a college of further education, regardless of
                whether that is the most suitable place to educate them. The
                criteria on which that can be done must be made clear. It should
                not be open-ended. The Committee will examine that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parts of the Bill should be welcomed.
                However, certain sections of the Bill, such as the enabling
                legislation, should not be passed until Members know exactly
                what the Department will impose on boards. Until there is
                clarification from the Department, the Assembly should be wary
                of some parts of the Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Having listened to Sammy Wilson’s remarks, I am glad that he
                is not the Minister of Education. He seemed to know what my
                Colleague and I were laughing at, though he has to admit that he
                has been a figure of fun in the past — not least in the media.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to be welcomed in the Bill, but
                there is still much work to be done. You would have thought that
                this was the main debate of the day. The battle lines have been
                drawn about how agreement is reached on various issues. However,
                I can see how that will work itself out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s past practice has always
                been to the benefit and best interest of all the children of
                Northern Ireland, and not any particular grouping. I welcome the
                consideration that lies behind the Bill and look forward to the
                Committee’s discussion of the final details, especially
                part&nbsp;I, clauses&nbsp;1&nbsp;to&nbsp;7. I welcome the
                enabling legislation that will allow the Minister to introduce a
                common funding formula for schools, thus bringing to an end the
                disparity between similar schools in the board areas and the
                fact that there were seven different formulae. The issue was
                debated at length last year. Many schools, especially those in
                areas of high disadvantage, await the Minister’s final
                proposals with hope and some trepidation. I hope that the
                Minister will take advantage of the enabling legislation in
                order to introduce a fair and equitable funding scheme. Perhaps
                the fears that were mentioned will not unfold.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses&nbsp;11, 12 and 13 in part II of the
                Bill are based on the wording of the Local Government (Best
                Value) Act (Northern Ireland) 2002, which was passed by the
                Assembly earlier this year. Those clauses will allow the
                Department of Education to take steps to ensure that education
                and library boards comply with equality legislation in the
                functions that they exercise and in the contracts that they
                enter into.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Issues such as fair employment and equality
                can be taken into account, not just price. I welcome the
                departure from the purely monetary approach of the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I especially commend the Minister and his
                Department on part III of the Bill, which proposes to strengthen
                children’s rights. I particularly applaud the proposed
                requirement for schools to have a written anti-bullying policy
                that complies with current departmental guidance. It is
                important that those policies be written down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present approach is very haphazard.
                Schools can decide to have no guidance or policy. Where policies
                are designed, they often depend on how people feel at the time,
                or on how individuals feel about dealing with bullying or any
                difficulties with young children. It is down to individuals,
                individual schools, boards of governors and whomever else they
                consult at the time. Guidelines must be written down in order
                for people to know exactly how to react to those difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bullying is an especially complex issue. We
                want to find a way of resolving it because, as has been said, it
                has one of the greatest impacts on individuals and schools.
                Something must be done, because the problem has not been dealt
                with yet. Some form of approach is required, and written
                guidance would be no bad thing. Unless such a policy exists in
                writing and is of a certain standard, it is difficult for pupils
                and their parents to discuss bullying with a school that parents
                feel has failed to protect their children adequately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that, in those unhappy
                cases where a child has been left vulnerable, the legislation
                does not require written guidance. Recent research into mental
                health and the well-being of young people has listed bullying as
                a major factor in depression and suicide. Bullying is not only a
                matter of children’s rights, but a matter of children’s
                health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome part IV, which mentions a complete
                ban on corporal punishment, as proposed in clause 34. I will not
                comment on it as it has already been mentioned. However, I am
                opposed completely to Sammy Wilson’s notion of corporal
                punishment and, indeed, his laughable comments on other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Corporal punishment in schools is recognised
                widely as an assault on children. It can only be described as a
                physical assault on children. It is no longer seen as the
                hallmark of good education, but rather as an admission of a
                school’s failure to establish good behaviour except through
                the use of force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a time when this society is moving away
                from the use of force to solve its political problems, it would
                be a very unwelcome step to go back or continue with corporal
                punishment for the benefit of education. I will continue to hold
                that view in this debate and at Committee level. There is no
                place for corporal punishment, and Members should not support
                it.</p>

                change of formula? How does the Department of Education propose
                to agree enrolment figures for the purposes of funding in
                respect of school intakes in September? At the latter end of the
                previous financial year, that could be highly speculative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In part I of the Bill, clause 2(5)(b) states
                that the common funding formula</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;may include provision for taking into
                account factors affecting the particular needs of any class or
                description of school.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The explanatory and financial memorandum
                refers to voluntary grammar schools and grant-maintained
                integrated schools. Why does the Bill not mention them? Will a
                common formula apply to all primary, secondary and grammar
                schools?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implication in clause 2, subsections (5),
                (6) and (7) is that the preparatory department of a grammar
                school is likely to receive nil funding. Why is a preparatory
                school not permitted funding equal to that of a primary school?
                There are tiny primary schools and Irish-medium schools, all of
                which receive funding. In the name of equality I cannot
                understand why, if some parents choose a preparatory school, why
                funding should not be equal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 21 gives the Minister of Education the
                right, following consultation with</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to determine certain circumstances regarding
                the removal of members of boards of governors. The explanatory
                and financial memorandum refers to those bodies as the education
                and library boards and the Council for Catholic Maintained
                Schools (CCMS). Could that not be made clear in the Bill? In
                addition, why is this the only instance in which the Minister,
                and not the Department of Education, has been given the power?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When taking into account the common funding
                formula, consideration should be given to the exclusion of
                teachers’ salaries from the local management of schools
                budget. Teachers’ salary costs should be centrally retained,
                thus removing a major cause of inequality.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                The main purpose of the Bill is dealt with in part I, which
                contains provisions to enable the Department of Education to
                introduce a single common funding formula for the calculation of
                budgets for all schools funded under LMS arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat that to have seven different
                formulae is indefensible, inequitable and nonsensical. I am
                committed, as are almost all of us, to the single common
                formula. That will effectively ensure that schools with similar
                characteristics receive similar levels of funding, regardless of
                the area or sector in which they are located.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also remember that the principle of a
                common funding formula has been agreed by the Executive and is
                stated in the Programme for Government. It received widespread
                endorsement in the consultation exercise undertaken last year,
                and it is supported by the Committee for Education, apart from
                the individual comments of some Members. Although the make-up of
                the formula has not yet been agreed, it is agreed generally that
                there should be a common formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Members in general will
                welcome these provisions for the simple reason that they remove
                the inequalities in our current system of funding for schools.
                It is important to emphasise that nothing in the arrangements
                for the common funding formula would prejudice or pre-empt any
                decision on the most appropriate structures for post-primary
                education. Danny Kennedy raised that point in the course of his
                contribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the Bill is to introduce
                a common funding formula for calculating schools’ budgets.
                Here we can address an outstanding issue that many Members agree
                must be dealt with. The detail of the common funding scheme,
                including the formula, has yet to be finalised, and I hope to
                work closely with the Committee for Education in the coming
                months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those Members who contributed to such
                an important debate. Danny Kennedy’s contribution was
                especially encouraging, as it was generally positive and
                helpful. I am always happy to discuss the need for change with
                the Committee. I welcome its views, and, although I may not
                agree with all of them, it is essential that those views be fed
                into the decision-making process. Decisions on funding levels
                impact on schools, and on the pupils and staff. In my response
                to the Committee’s report, I stated that I am happy to discuss
                the relevant issues with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson raised concerns about the level
                of support for the common funding formula. Most of the proposals
                commanded majority support, with a significant number attracting
                a high level of support. Not surprisingly, some proposals
                attracted less support and my officials have reflected further
                on respondents’ comments. Points that were raised include: the
                size of the budget; TSN; the treatment of teachers’ salary
                costs; and the funding of Irish-medium provision. I expect those
                issues to be subject to further discussions with the Committee
                for Education as part of the development of the common funding
                scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson referred also to the approval of
                the scheme. The common funding scheme will be published by the
                Department and made available to Members as a matter of course.
                However, it is not the intention that the scheme will be subject
                to the approval of the Assembly, although, of course, the
                Committee for Education can continue to play an important role
                in its development and operation. Any Member can initiate a
                debate on the scheme at any time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to point out to Sammy
                Wilson that existing LMS schemes are not set out in Regulations.
                The timetable for subordinate legislation would mean that any
                changes to the common funding scheme would have to be identified
                up to a year in advance of application, which would restrict the
                formula’s capacity to react quickly to changing circumstances.
                Were Regulations a requirement, the common formula could not be
                implemented for the 2003-04 funding allocations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister give way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I want to respond to all Sammy Wilson’s
                points. He raised the issue of ministerial decision making. I
                note his concerns but I must take account of the practicalities.
                Schools must be informed of their budgets in advance of the new
                financial year. Decisions on the make-up of the scheme and the
                formula must be made on the basis of the information that is
                available on trends in schools. That highlights the need to
                avoid a cumbersome and bureaucratic approval process. I am
                conscious of the need to work closely with the Committee to
                achieve as much consensus as possible, and I shall continue to
                do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson said that policies on bullying
                will not solve the problem and that effective sanctions are
                needed. I am abolishing corporal punishment, which has been
                outlawed in all grant-aided schools since 1987. New provision
                will extend that law to independent schools and is necessary to
                comply with a judgement of the European Court of Human Rights,
                so we do not have any discretion. The provision is necessary
                because bullying exists in our schools and can have a serious
                educational and emotional impact on the children involved. Many
                schools have already voluntarily developed an anti-bullying
                policy. However, I want to strengthen the legislation on school
                discipline to make it mandatory for every grant-aided school to
                have a written anti-bullying policy, and, more importantly, to
                implement it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Duty of care is also important. The
                provisions that I am introducing simply make the in loco
                parentis duty explicit. That duty is existing common law, and
                the courts rely on it. It has existed since 1995 for boarders.
                There has been no evidence that that provision has been used
                mischievously — all children deserve the same safeguards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The clause dealing with Key Stage 4 pupils
                who continue on to further education colleges allows education
                and library boards to make provision at a further education
                institution for any pupil over 14 who is not on a school
                register. A pupil will not be able to decide to leave school to
                go to further education. The clause will allow boards to provide
                for expelled and disaffected pupils for whom they are obliged to
                provide education; this they do by means of home tuition or
                education at places other than schools. Boards will now be able
                to do that by placing pupils in further education colleges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson and Joan Carson referred to
                removing boards of governors. The legislation allows governors
                to be removed for particular reasons, such as bankruptcy. The
                Department of Education also has the power to appoint governors
                to a board in certain circumstances. I expect this power to be
                used only in exceptional circumstances. It is designed to deal
                with situations in which, for example, a school fails to provide
                adequate education, and the Department holds the view that the
                entire board of governors, through its actions or inaction,
                contributes wholly or partly to that failure. It is not possible
                to prescribe all the circumstances in which that may arise, so
                it is intended that the Department should be able to invoke the
                power when it is convinced that that is in a school’s best
                interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson also mentioned grammar schools’
                preparatory departments, and she asked whether further
                reductions in public funding are planned for them. My answer is
                &quot;Not necessarily&quot;, but given the need to maintain firm
                control of public expenditure, it is simply impossible to give
                guarantees on any area of expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson also mentioned teachers’
                salaries. During the consultation there was no significant
                support for removing teachers’ salaries from the local
                management of schools funding, and it is important to point that
                out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson referred to Irish-medium
                education. I do not propose to go into detail on that —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will recall that in the
                consultation on the local management of schools funding formula
                on teachers’ salaries, the clear suggestion was made that the
                actual salaries should be met rather than the average salaries,
                which is the present situation. Is the Minister prepared to
                accept that principle in his new arrangements?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear during the consultation, and
                everybody accepted it, that there was no significant support for
                removing teachers’ salaries from local management of schools
                funding. If there are other dimensions to that, there will
                doubtless be further discussions between officials, the
                Committee for Education and me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to point out that
                Irish-medium schools and units have additional costs. I will be
                happy to discuss that with the Committee for Education in
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is effectively all that I have to say. I

                additional charge to the owner, unless it is appropriate to
                exempt a driver from the requirement on medical grounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Government-supported private Member’s
                Bill at Westminster, tabled by Neil Gerrard MP, seeks to extend
                those provisions so that they apply to private hire taxi drivers
                and operators. In Northern Ireland, the 1995 Act became a
                transferred matter on devolution. There are, therefore, two ways
                in which legislation can be dealt with for Northern Ireland.
                First, we could amend the 1995 Act by means of a Bill, which
                would mean that the current Westminster Bill would only apply to
                Great Britain. On the other hand, we could seek, through this
                motion, to apply the Westminster Bill to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments to the 1995 Act would have to be
                made through primary legislation in the Assembly and could not
                be completed until 2003-04 at the earliest. That would leave
                disabled persons in Northern Ireland disadvantaged in comparison
                with such people in the rest of the United Kingdom, so I am
                seeking inclusion in the Westminster Bill, which would mean a
                shorter timescale for implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position at Westminster is that the
                Private Hire Vehicles (Carriage of Guide Dogs etc.) Bill has
                completed its Committee Stage in the House of Commons and is due
                to receive its Third Reading on 19 July. Today, we have an
                opportunity to take advantage of the Bill and improve the
                transport options for disabled people here who depend on guide
                and other assistant dogs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Royal National Institute of the Blind
                (RNIB) recently contacted officials in my Department to express
                its wholehearted support for the motion. It conducted a survey
                recently that found that one in five visually-impaired people
                use taxis as least once each week, mainly because such
                door-to-door transport is more convenient for getting around.
                The RNIB is aware of instances in Northern Ireland of a disabled
                person with a guide dog being refused a taxi. The Bill addresses
                such discrimination. As there are approximately 100 guide dogs
                and other assistance dogs in Northern Ireland, we should not
                ignore the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for the Environment discussed
                the proposal at a meeting on 6 June. I appreciate its prompt
                consideration of what we are trying to achieve. The Committee
                gave an enthusiastic welcome to the proposal in a letter dated
                10 June 2002, from the Chairperson of the Committee for the
                Environment, Rev Dr William McCrea.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to confirm that, subject to
                Members’ approval today, the Executive endorse this proposal,
                which will enable the provisions of the Disability
                Discrimination Act 1995 to be applied to private hire taxis. I
                commend the motion to the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
                Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion. In March 2001, the
                Committee considered a consultation document from the Department
                of the Environment on introducing legislation to place a duty on
                licensed public taxi drivers to carry guide dogs and other
                assistant dogs without charge. In welcoming that proposal, the
                Committee pressed for the provision to be extended to private
                taxi drivers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 30 May 2002, the Minister of the
                Environment wrote to me to say that it was proposed to extend to
                Northern Ireland a Westminster Bill on the carriage of guide
                dogs and other assistant dogs in private hire taxis. The
                Committee considered the long-overdue initiative on 6 June 2002
                and gave it a genuine welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered a further letter
                from the Department of the Environment last Thursday, when
                Members were updated on the Department’s position. The letter
                also provided the precise terms of the proposed Northern Ireland
                amendments to the Westminster Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of my Colleagues pressed me on whether a
                private Member’s Bill was the best way to proceed. The
                Minister assured us that this was the most appropriate way to
                ensure that legislation would be passed during this session of
                the Assembly, not solely because it is a private Member’s
                Bill, as often they do not see the light of day, but because it
                is one that has the support of the Government. If this procedure
                will speed the enactment of the legislation, I give it an
                enthusiastic welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that any disabled person with
                a guide dog should be refused travel in a public or private
                taxi. The matter is of great concern to disabled people. In
                particular, it affects blind people, and I endorse the Royal
                National Institute of the Blind’s welcome of the urgent
                enactment of the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to recognise that the
                Committee speaks with one voice in welcoming the initiative. I
                ask Members to support the motion, and I encourage them to make
                every effort to ensure that the Bill becomes law soon, so that
                disabled people here can enjoy the protection to which they are
                entitled.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                the Environment (Ms Lewsley):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill, and I agree with many of
                the Chairperson’s comments. This Bill is long overdue, and the
                Committee is delighted to see it. I want to raise some issues
                with the Minister because, with legislation and its
                implementation, come responsibilities. The Committee asked
                officials about the number of disabled people who had complained
                about being denied access to private hire vehicles. They said
                that there were very few. I do not know whether there is a lack
                of communication within the Department, but some
                &quot;not-so-high&quot; officials agreed that there have been a
                number of complaints.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following on from that, what procedures will
                the Minister put in place to allow people who are disabled, and
                who have been denied access to a private hire vehicle, to
                complain? Do they take their complaints to the Department, the
                taxi firm or their local disability organisation? Also, what
                type of educational information will the Department issue so
                that people know the right route to take? Who will be
                responsible for enforcement if a person is denied access to a
                taxi — the Department or the taxi firm? Who will then be
                liable for the penalty — the taxi company or the taxi driver?
                What penalties will be imposed on taxi drivers if they deny
                access to people with disabilities?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to know about the health and
                safety aspect. Black taxis for public hire have a screen between
                the driver and the passenger in the back. What about the safety
                of taxi drivers when a guide dog is in a private vehicle? What
                type of training and help will the RNIB give to ensure that
                guide dogs are properly trained to be carried in that type of
                vehicle?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are just a few issues that have been
                raised by constituents and others. I hope that the Minister will
                take them on board.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson and Deputy
                Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment for their
                remarks. I was struck particularly by Dr&nbsp;McCrea’s comment
                that the Committee spoke with one voice. Only those with
                disabilities can appreciate fully the difficulties they face, so
                we should with all haste —but not with undue haste — move
                forward on this matter. Dr&nbsp;McCrea said that some Colleagues
                pressed him on whether a private Member’s Bill was the best
                way to proceed with this, and I thank him for accepting my
                assurance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson raised some very
                interesting points about protection of people, person, about
                education, about screens to protect drivers, about the training
                of guide dogs and about enforcing penalties. Those matters will
                probably have to be taken up in the Regulations. Those aspects,
                even when we are looking for accelerated passage for a Bill, are
                usually covered by Regulations separate from the Bill and go
                through full consultation with the Committee and others. I do
                not know whether the Regulations will encapsulate all the points
                that the Deputy Chairperson raised, but that is probably where
                they should reside. We will look into that and ensure that all
                such issues are taken care of.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first point that the Deputy Chairperson
                mentioned was the confusion about the number of disabled people
                denied access.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All I can say is that the Royal National
                Institute of the Blind, which is the authority that has the most
                communication and knows what the situation is, is supportive of
                what we want to do. One in five people use private taxis because
                they are the best way to get from door to door, and if this is
                the case, it is up to us to ensure that nothing inhibits that.
                Even though there were some criticisms, we want those who are
                impaired in this way to feel that the law is on their side; they
                should not be seeking comfort in the hope that a taxi driver
                might allow them to be passengers as a concession. There should
                be a law, and they should be comforted by it. I see that the
                Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment endorses what I
                am saying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have covered most of the comments. We look
                forward to seeing the Regulations, and I hope that we will again
                speak with one voice. I commend the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset, I thank the various bodies
                that came to the Committee to provide evidence. Even though the
                issue is somewhat complex, I intend to be as concise as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will begin by providing some background to
                the proposed Order in Council. On 19 February 1998, the
                Government announced a review into the provision and
                administration of legal aid in Northern Ireland. The
                announcement indicated that officials would undertake a review
                into arrangements for the administration and provision of legal
                aid in Northern Ireland, introducing recommendations for change
                where necessary. Officials would also consider, in the Northern
                Ireland context, the proposed reforms to legal aid in England
                and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of that review, a consultation
                paper, ‘Public Benefit and the Public Purse’, was published
                on 14 June 1999. Publication of the consultation paper marked
                the start of the first substantive public discussion on legal
                aid for many years. The consultation paper set out the
                Government’s objectives for, and commitment to, the
                modernisation of legal aid in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objectives set by the Government in the
                consultation paper are summarised as follows: ensuring
                appropriate funding arrangements are in place to secure access
                to the most appropriate means to resolve legal issues for
                citizens; targeting resources to those in greatest need;
                ensuring that legal services are affordable and controllable;
                securing value for money from quality legal services; and
                establishing the most effective and efficient administrative
                structure to deliver legal services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After consultation, the Government published
                a White Paper, ‘The Way Ahead’ in September 2000. The
                Government stated that the approach set out in the White Paper
                would provide a modern, transparent and accountable
                administrative structure to deliver quality assured legal
                services to all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The White Paper showed that through the
                reform programme the Government were determined to take
                effective control of the public funding allocated for providing
                legal services and to ensure that the funds available were
                targeted at meeting the real needs of the most vulnerable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To assist with its deliberations of the draft
                Access to Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2002 the Committee
                heard evidence from the Lord Chancellor’s Department of the
                Northern Ireland Court Service, the Law Society of Northern
                Ireland, the General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland, the
                Northern Ireland Association of Citizens’ Advice Bureaux and
                the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Committee’s deliberations on the
                proposals for reform of the legal aid system in Northern
                Ireland, members considered a wide variety of issues. I will
                provide Members with details of the Committee’s deliberations
                and recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee welcomed the opportunity to
                consider the proposals for reform of the legal aid system in
                Northern Ireland and recognised that those proposals would be of
                major significance for many years. However, given the importance
                of those proposals, the Committee considered that a full, proper
                and meaningful consultation would be vital, as the proposals
                would affect the future of legal aid provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee expressed concern about the
                time allocated to consider the draft Access to Justice (Northern
                Ireland) Order 2002, although it was within the 60 days allowed
                under section 85 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Due to the
                wide-ranging and complex areas for consideration, the Committee
                was of the opinion that there was a need for scrutiny of the
                draft Order and any subsequent implementation plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recommended that the Secretary
                of State continue to apprise the Assembly of any amendments to
                the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered the establishment of
                a legal services commission. It will be responsible for the
                administration of the public funding of legal services; making
                new provision for the public funding of civil legal services;
                making new provision for the public funding of criminal legal
                services; providing for the registration of those seeking to
                provide publicly funded legal services; and making provision for
                alternative methods of paying for legal services, that is
                conditional fee arrangements and litigation fund agreements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said at the outset that some complexity was
                involved; I hope that Members can follow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee agreed with the principle of
                establishing an impartial legal services commission that would
                remove the administration of legal aid from the Law Society, a
                body whose members benefit from the present provision of legal
                aid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When scrutinising the legislation, the
                Committee formed the view that many of the proposed major areas
                were seen as contingent legislation; they will provide fall-back
                positions if the proposals do not go according to plan. The
                Committee had serious reservations about that procedure. The
                proposal to allow a legal services commission to implement much
                of the detail without many of the areas being defined clearly in
                the legislation is a cause for concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Committee noted evidence from
                the Law Society. It stated that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we do have considerable reservations as
                to whether another Commission of this type or size is necessary
                or appropriate for the administration of legal aid in Northern
                Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee expressed concern over the lack
                of detail on the projected establishment of the legal services
                commission and its running costs. The Committee recommended,
                therefore, that the Secretary of State should deliver a more
                detailed and transparent implementation plan in parallel with
                the draft Order in Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now move on to the provision of civil
                legal services. Under existing legislation, the Law Society
                administers legal aid to provide advice, assistance and
                representation to parties in certain civil proceedings, subject
                to a merits test and, in some cases, a means test. Civil legal
                aid is available under three schemes at present. The Lord
                Chancellor’s Department has described those schemes and the
                means test as follows:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Legal Advice and Assistance (Green Form
                Scheme)</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legal advice and assistance, otherwise known
                as the Green Form Scheme, is intended to cover preliminary
                advice and assistance from a solicitor including advice, writing
                letters, entering into negotiations, obtaining an opinion and
                the preparation of a tribunal case.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It continues:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;ABWOR</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assistance by way of representation (ABWOR)
                covers the preparation and presentation of civil cases in the
                Magistrates’ Court. These cases include separation,
                maintenance and paternity proceedings and certain work in
                respect of children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Civil legal aid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The granting of civil legal aid is a matter
                for the Law Society through the Legal Aid Committee and the
                Legal Aid Department and is subject to certain statutory
                criteria.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Order proposes to deliver civil
                legal services through advice, assistance and representation.
                Accordingly, the legal services commission will establish and
                maintain a new fund to provide civil legal services. The Lord
                Chancellor will pay such sums into the fund as he may determine
                and may impose conditions on those payments. The fund will be
                capped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legal services commission will prepare a
                funding code, which will set out the criteria for determining
                whether civil legal services should be provided in a particular
                case. That code will also set out the procedures for making
                applications for funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee raised concerns about the level
                at which the fund will be capped, how that level will be
                determined and what process will be used to review the cap.
                Indeed, in the evidence given by the Northern Ireland
                Association of Citizen’s Advice Bureaux (NIACAB), a strong
                case was made for the retention of ABWOR as an independent
                service. The Committee noted that, at present, legal aid is
                payable in respect of time spent in preparing for a tribunal,
                but not for any representation at a tribunal. The statistical
                evidence provided by NIACAB displays the value of representation
                at tribunals. The Committee supported the extension of
                representation in tribunals, and noted the recent reforms in
                Scotland that make civil legal aid available in some situations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee, therefore, recommended that
                the Secretary of State should ensure that further quantitative
                and qualitative research into the need for civil legal services
                be carried out in advance of the application of any cap to the
                fund, and that he should consider extending funding to support
                all clients in preparation for and attendance at tribunals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is currently a potential unmet need in
                the civil legal aid sector. NIACAB deals with approximately
                200,000 clients a year. However, the organisation estimates that
                there is an unmet need of an additional 200,000 clients a year.
                The Committee agreed that any funding set aside by the legal
                services commission will have to take account of the needs of
                the community and voluntary sectors. The Committee recommended
                that the Secretary of State should arrange for further research
                to be undertaken into the scale of the unmet needs of those
                sectors and should make appropriate funding arrangements to meet
                those needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee noted the concerns of the
                Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which stated that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the exclusion of election petitions
                from the range of available civil legal services… would mean
                that important electoral rights (protected by Article 3 of
                Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights,
                incorporated into our law by the Human Rights Act 1998)) could
                not be vindicated with the assistance of publicly-funded legal
                services.&quot;</p>
                </font><i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </font></i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee supported the view of the
                Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and recommended
                therefore that the Secretary of State revise the schedule to the
                draft Bill and that he make the appropriate amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legal services commission will prepare a
                funding code that will set out the criteria for determining
                whether civil legal services should be provided in any given
                case. The code will also set out the procedures for making
                funding applications. The Committee considered the proposed
                funding code and the set of procedures that will apply to it.
                Committee members and some witnesses expressed concern about the
                prioritisation of cases that will be covered by the fund. The
                Committee would welcome prior consultation on any proposals for
                the prioritisation of clients in that regard. The Committee
                recommended that the Secretary of State publish the criteria to
                be used for prioritising clients who seek assistance from the
                civil legal aid fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under current legislation, criminal legal aid
                is available to individuals who are charged with an offence,
                appear before a court or are brought before a court to be dealt
                with, subject to the applicant’s satisfying the court that he
                has insufficient means to fund his or her defence and that it is
                in the interest of justice that he or she should receive legal
                aid. The draft Order proposes to replace that scheme.
                Accordingly, the legal services commission will establish and
                maintain a fund to provide criminal legal services. The Lord
                Chancellor will pay such sums into the fund as he may determine,
                and he may impose conditions on those payments. Unlike the civil
                fund, the criminal fund will not be capped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The General Council of the Bar of Northern
                Ireland stated in its evidence to the Committee that the level
                of representation for the client should be determined by the
                court and not by the commission. It maintained that only the
                court can take an informed and objective view of the level of
                representation required in the light of the issues, substance,
                seriousness and complexity of an individual case. The Committee
                concurred with the General Council of the Bar of Northern
                Ireland in its view that article 30 of the draft Order is wholly
                restrictive of access to justice. It recommended that the
                Secretary of State maintain the existing situation whereby the
                level of representation is administered by the court.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legal services commission will be
                required to prepare a criminal defence service code of conduct.
                It applies to employees of the commission such as salary
                defenders and employees of any body established and maintained
                by the commission in the provision of criminal defence services.
                The code is to be prepared or revised only in consultation with
                the Law Society of Northern Ireland and the General Council of
                the Bar of Northern Ireland and such other bodies or persons as
                the legal services commission considers appropriate. It must be
                approved by both Houses of Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Lord Chancellor may, by Regulation,
                establish a registration scheme and code of practice. Only firms
                and individuals that are registered, comply with the code of
                practice and satisfy quality mechanisms and monitoring will be
                entitled to provide publicly funded legal services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee noted evidence from the Law
                Society of Northern Ireland in which it stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;No-one would wish to argue with the
                proposition that legal services must be of a consistently high
                quality.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee supports that view; however, it
                requested further details on the quality standards that will be
                imposed and on how they will be applied to firms and
                individuals. The Committee recommended that the Secretary of
                State publish the draft criminal defence service code of conduct
                and any details on the registration scheme and code of practice
                before laying the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Order proposes a statutory basis
                for conditional fee agreements. They are also known as &quot;no
                win, no fee&quot; agreements and are intended to allow lawyers
                and clients to share the risks and possible gains of litigation.
                The draft Order provides that enforceable conditional fee
                agreements can be entered into between lawyers and their
                clients. They cannot be employed in criminal or family
                proceedings. The legal services commission would not be involved
                in conditional fee agreements; they are entirely private
                agreements between lawyers and clients. The Lord Chancellor, in
                consultation with the Law Society of Northern Ireland, the
                General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland and others may,
                by regulation, define the proceedings in which such fees are to
                be permitted and prescribe their maximum size.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered evidence from the
                Law Society and the General Council of the Bar of Northern
                Ireland. The latter stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Conditional fees should not be
                introduced into Northern Ireland until such time has passed that
                would allow consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of
                their use in England and Wales and a study to be made to assess
                whether they are required in Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee accepted the need for further
                research into conditional fee arrangements. It therefore
                recommended that the Secretary of State arrange for further
                research into that in advance of their proposed introduction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Order also provides a statutory
                basis for litigation funding agreements. They are made between
                an individual and those who represent a privately established
                fund — not with the lawyer taking the case, as occurs with
                conditional fee agreements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Lord Chancellor is empowered to make
                remuneration Orders setting out a range of fees, or mechanisms
                for calculating fees that the proposed legal services commission
                will implement and observe when funding criminal legal services
                and civil legal services. Remuneration Orders could set
                all-inclusive standard fees, the scales of fees, hourly rates,
                the rates for preparation and travelling time, and the methods
                for determining fees in exceptional cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered a written submission
                from the Law Society of Northern Ireland which criticised
                proposals for privately funded litigation arrangements. It made
                proposals for a publicly funded contingency legal aid fund,
                which could be administered on a not-for-profit basis. The
                Committee recognised that there may be some merit in that
                proposal and urged that it be given further consideration. The
                Committee recommended that the Secretary of State arrange for
                further research into the feasibility of establishing a
                contingency legal aid fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be glad to hear me conclude. I
                can confirm that the Committee recognised that reform of the
                legal aid system is welcome and overdue. However, it adjudged
                that the provision of a short consultation period on a draft
                Order in Council in an important, complex area is wholly
                inappropriate. The Committee noted that large sections of the
                Order are, at best, aspirational, and, at worst, lacking in any
                degree of detail. The absence of a time-bound implementation
                plan, and heavy reliance on the proposed new legal services
                commission for the delivery of many facets of the new system,
                caused the Committee concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee would welcome further and
                extensive consultation with all interested parties before the
                laying of the Order in Council. Apart from the complexities that
                I have outlined, it was a piece of cake.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Ad Hoc
                Committee on the Draft Access to Justice (Northern Ireland)
                Order 2002 (Mr A Maginness):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a good report, rightly and
                constructively critical of the proposed legislation. I declared
                to the Committee my interest as a member of the Northern Ireland
                Bar, and I do so again at the commencement of this address to
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is balanced and critical, and it
                is made by people who are not intimately involved in the
                provision of legal services. They have brought their common
                sense to the scrutiny of the legislation, as they have judgement
                that is critical without being destructive. There is a need for
                a reform of the legal aid system in Northern Ireland. However,
                the Order is not the way to reform it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Access to Justice (Northern
                Ireland) Order would be more appropriately named the prevention
                of access to justice (Northern Ireland) Order. If it is passed
                into law, many people will be prevented from achieving justice
                and accessing legal services in Northern Ireland — and I say
                that without fear of contradiction or the accusation of
                exaggeration, such is the deficiency of the draft Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, there is a need for reform.
                The Government, in their consideration, purported to consult
                with those involved in the provision of legal services. They
                also had access to the report of the inquiry chaired by Judge
                David Smyth. That report examined the provision of legal
                services in Northern Ireland and identified the changes that
                would have brought significant and helpful reform to the current
                system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, legal aid has been
                progressively eroded so that ordinary folk do not have access to
                it. In Northern Ireland, you must be either very rich or very
                poor to be confident of having access to legal services. For
                many years, the Government have been cutting back on the
                threshold that allows ordinary people to have sufficient access
                to legal aid. You may say that that is too bad and that people
                should pay for the service. In effect they do pay through their
                taxes, but they also can, and do, pay for that service by way of
                contribution, and that is also fair. The Government have created
                a situation where many ordinary people whose income is not
                excessive, but does not verge on the poverty threshold, do not
                have an opportunity to access legal services. That is
                fundamentally wrong, and the Assembly should oppose it. We can
                have the best courts and the best legal system in the world, but
                if they cannot be accessed through legal practitioners, there is
                no point in having that &quot;Rolls Royce&quot; system of
                justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must look at the system afresh. We have to
                frame a new system that takes account of the nature of legal
                services in Northern Ireland, which is quite different from that
                in England, Wales and Scotland. Some 90% of legal practitioners
                here are small businesses with three or fewer members. They are
                run throughout Northern Ireland, and most people can go to a
                local solicitor if they wish. However, it is difficult and
                expensive to embark on litigation because not only do you have
                to provide the payment for the lawyer of your choice but, in the
                event of your failure, you also have to pay for the other side’s
                lawyer. You have to tread warily. Therefore, it is important to
                have a system that is accessible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bar Council in Northern Ireland is also
                much more accessible than that of England, which tends to be
                much more élite and removed from the ordinary punter. The
                system in Northern Ireland provides much greater accessibility;
                that is good and should be preserved. The Law Society and the
                Bar Council have told the Government to preserve what is good
                and not to impose an English solution on an Irish problem. The
                Government said that they would not impose a solution. However,
                the Order shows that the English system is being superimposed
                upon the system here. If devolution means anything, the
                Westminster Government should listen to what the Assembly says
                about the local system. The Order’s proposals do not suit
                local circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;no win, no fee&quot; approach,
                which is envisaged in that system, would create a new legal
                culture that I and many others believe would damage the system
                here. Lawyers would start to cherry-pick cases. They would
                simply select good cases that they know they would win and would
                abandon those that they believe would not be successful. That
                would mean that those with marginal cases, who deserve a chance,
                would not be given an opportunity. Those who win their cases
                would pay more to their legal representatives. That is
                fundamentally wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Law Society and the Bar Council of
                Northern Ireland agree that that is wrong. The Assembly should
                listen to them. The Bar Council proposes a contingent legal aid
                fund, and that should be considered. The report asks for further
                research on that. The Ad Hoc Committee wants a local solution to
                a local problem. The Bar Council and the Law Society have shown
                us a direction that the Assembly should examine further. A new
                system is needed — not one based on profits, but one that
                preserves the basic integrity of the legal service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our legal aid bill is not high; it is not as
                high as in England and Wales. It is on a par, roughly, with the
                service in Scotland. Legal aid can be kept at a level that does
                not place an unfair burden on taxpayers in Northern Ireland. The
                Smyth Report showed that. It examined it carefully, compared it
                to what happens in other parts of the United Kingdom and came to
                that conclusion. That is a fact. The Government are undermining
                a fairly successful system that gives taxpayers good value for
                their money by trying to introduce a system that can only be
                described as &quot;justice on the cheap&quot;. It will not work.
                It will cut corners, and it will do a grave disservice to
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a grave danger in permitting the
                legal services commission effectively to determine the
                appointment of defence counsel in criminal trials. That will
                adversely impact on our criminal justice system. I believe, as
                do the professional bodies and any right-thinking people, that
                the court should be the arbiter in determining counsel for those
                involved in criminal trials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is wrong for the new body to have that
                responsibility. A judge is in the right position to make a
                judgement. He is independent, experienced and skilled and knows
                the nature of the trial and the criminal offences of which a
                person is accused. In those circumstances, it is fundamentally
                wrong and an erosion of human rights not to allow the court to
                determine that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appeal system under article 31 of the
                Order is, in many ways, so cumbersome and bureaucratic that it
                will undoubtedly be of no practical use and will further erode
                the rights of the accused.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of this House seek to promote the
                interests of the people of Northern Ireland. The Government, on
                justice issues, have been blind to those interests. We have
                witnessed the Government’s contemptuous rejection of the ‘Report
                on the Proposal for a Draft Injuries Compensation (Northern
                Ireland) Order 2001’, which was unanimously approved by the
                Assembly. The Government seem to be totally insensitive to the
                concerns and needs of the people here as expressed by this
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Government will take more
                careful note of this report, because this House cares about the
                fundamental interests and welfare of the people of Northern
                Ireland, irrespective of their religion or political opinion.
                The Government should, for once, listen to the views of the
                people here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reform is good, but this Order does not
                constitute reform, and, therefore, it is not good.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a particular interest in this because
                I regularly deal with people who need legal and advice services
                and am aware of the particular difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with Alban Maginness. We both sat on
                the Ad Hoc Committee on Criminal Injuries Compensation and did
                much work on that report, as the members of the Ad Hoc Committee
                on the proposed Draft Access to Justice (Northern Ireland) Order
                2002 now have. It was with contempt and arrogance that the
                Government dismissed the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on which
                I sat, and it seems that this report will receive similar
                treatment. It is an almost immaterial exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because our circumstances are entirely
                different, we want to introduce something here that is different
                from what England and Wales have. We also want to work on behalf
                of the people who are most in need, and their situations can be
                very different from those of people in England and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report says that reform is overdue.
                People often imagine, falsely, that Government reviews will
                improve things. Unless care is taken, reviews can do more harm
                than good. Sometimes Government officials push for changes that
                are contrary to a Bill’s perceived aim and which do not
                benefit the public. As Alban Maginness said, under the draft
                Access to Justice Order, which is designed to give access to
                legal aid, the opposite will happen. Legal aid has been eroded,
                but many still need it, especially working families and small
                business owners who cannot defend their position because they
                cannot risk incurring the costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed introduction of a new legal aid
                scheme by an Order in Council is neither satisfactory nor
                democratic. Moreover, the consultation process was
                unsatisfactory. The decisions paper lacked sufficient detail to
                enable a meaningful assessment. Once the draft Order was made
                available, inadequate time was given for scrutiny. Although I
                welcome the Committee’s recommendation for ongoing scrutiny of
                the Order and the subsequent implementation plan, I will be
                interested to note the response of the Northern Ireland Office
                to that proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As is often the case, the draft Order does
                not deal with the specific circumstances of the Six Counties; it
                is identical in every material respect to the legislation in
                England and Wales. The major difference is that the British
                legislation received full parliamentary scrutiny. The key
                problems of cost and access to justice that were identified in
                England and Wales have not been recognised in the Six Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A main proposal of the Order is to transfer
                administrative responsibility from the Law Society of Northern
                Ireland to a new body to be called the Legal Services
                Commission. There is nothing to suggest that that model is the
                most appropriate one. According to the Law Society, the new body
                will impose a much higher burden on public funds than does the
                present scheme. Although the Bar welcomes the proposed Legal
                Services Commission, it does not accept that its powers, duties
                and responsibilities will meet the demands or the needs relating
                to access to justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part III of the Order contains the mechanism
                that led to the unregulated operation in England of claims
                management companies such as Claims Direct and the exploitation
                of litigants, et cetera. There has been widespread concern about
                the operation of part III of the provisions in England and
                Wales. The British Government’s solution to the issue of legal
                aid is primarily driven by cost consideration, as was the case
                with criminal injuries compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is our contention that legal aid provision
                was severely underfunded and that restricted access to legal
                services arose because of the continual lowering of the
                threshold below which an applicant could quality for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about the lack of
                independence of the Legal Services Commission, given its
                relationship with the Lord Chancellor. I welcome the Committee’s
                proposal that the commission be impartial. In short, I am
                disappointed that the British Government are imposing a solution
                for a problem that we believe does not exist.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset, I express my thanks to the
                Committee Clerks and to those who assisted the Committee in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been no meaningful consultation. I
                agree with Alban Maginness that, although the Committee
                scrutinised the provisions of the Order and heard evidence from
                experts, its findings will be ignored, as has happened in
                respect of meaningful consultation on other pieces of
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an indictment of the Government’s
                attitude to consultation because it pours contempt on the
                meaning of consultation; on this place; and on the Government’s
                attitude to the people whom we represent.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to note that not only
                have the Government shown contempt in the way in which they
                consulted with the House but they have also shown contempt for
                the professional bodies with which they should consult and
                contempt for those people who represent the organisations that
                use the justice system on a daily basis. After the Committee
                ordered the publication of the report, it received more
                information that, unfortunately, could not be included. However,
                that information must be put on record because it deals with
                issues that were pertinent to the Committee’s inquiry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee received a letter from the
                chief executive of the Law Society of Northern Ireland, Mr John
                Bailie, which outlines the activities that Government were
                engaged in during the consultation process. Not only did the
                Parliamentary Secretary in the Lord Chancellor’s Department
                give the society an undertaking that a decisions paper would be
                forwarded to it, but he gave it a commitment on how the
                consultation process would run, with a view to considering the
                elements of the decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his letter, Mr Bailie outlines what Mr
                Lock of the Lord Chancellor’s Department said with regard to
                his commitments, and it is important that his remarks are placed
                on record. Mr Lock said:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I will pay particular attention to the
                views of the Northern Ireland Assembly. An Order in Council will
                then be laid before the Westminster Parliament. The reforms I
                have outlined here are set out in more detail in the Decisions
                Paper which I am publishing to-day. There will be a further
                opportunity to comment on the detail of what we propose at that
                stage. Much of the detail remains to be worked through.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also said:</p>

                legislation is brought forward.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bailie informed the Committee in writing
                that, with the exception of the working group chaired by Judge
                Smyth, none of Mr Lock’s commitments were realised. If that is
                the way in which consultation is conducted with professional
                bodies that could influence the improvement of the legislation,
                I fear that the Government will ignore the Committee’s report.
                Mr Bailie also stated that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a period of some 21 months elapsed
                before the appearance of the promised Proposal for this Order in
                Council; the fact that the draft Order remains a framework which
                does very little other than to give effect to the outline
                proposals set out in the Decisions Paper, without the detail
                being provided to facilitate proper consultation; and the fact
                that very considerable expenditure has already been incurred by
                the Government in preparing for the implementation of these
                proposals&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those remarks show the Government’s
                attitude to real and meaningful consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must address the probable outcome if
                the draft legislation were endorsed by the House and by
                Westminster. Given that the draft legislation is vague, we would
                introduce bad law. It is vague on the big issues; on its purpose
                and intentions; on what it seeks to reform; on the make-up of
                the commission that it seeks to establish and the role that it
                should have; on the capping system that it wishes to implement;
                and on the code of conduct required to make it effectual. We
                must send a clear message to Government that, if they are vague
                on such big issues, they should go back to the drawing board and
                formulate draft legislation that addresses the access to justice
                issues that they claim to want to address. The draft legislation
                would also be bad law because it would hand the Government a
                blank cheque with which to run the legal system as they wish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we may hear the cry across Ulster
                &quot;Oh no, not another quango!&quot; with regard to the
                proposed commission. Another quango is exactly what would be
                established. Who will carry out that work? The head of that
                quango would have to be vested with such powers and skills as to
                overcome the competing sides; I do not believe that such a
                person exists. The Government have completely failed to come to
                terms with the underlying issue of alleged abuse of legal aid.
                By ignoring that abuse, the Government are not properly
                addressing what they ought to. In recommendation 2 we require
                that</p>

                for legal aid. The information that the Committee was given to

                and a lot of it was based on anecdotal evidence. Thus,
                recommendation 3 reads:</p>

                for Civil Legal Services, is carried out in advance of the
                application of any cap to the fund.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next, we recommended</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;That the Secretary of State considers
                extending funding to support all clients in preparation for and
                attendance at Tribunals.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must know exactly what the Government mean
                by &quot;capping&quot; and the level at which they intend to set
                it. We also need to know the formula that they intend to devise
                to address that. They could not produce a formula for us; they
                merely said that it was a moveable feast for which they must
                have a certain amount of money because the legal system changes
                each year. That is not good enough. One could not organise and
                run any Department in that way, and the legal system should not
                be run in that vague and unaccountable manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding must be provided for continued
                attendance and representation at tribunals. The table on page
                114 of the report illustrates that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;independent representation for the
                public at a tribunal lifts the success rate from 1 in 4 to 1 in
                2&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proper representation gets a true and just
                result; it is important that we facilitate that representation.
                Other Members have expressed the fear that representation would
                be denied to those in need; I agree.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must address the level of need fairly.
                None of the information given us by the Northern Ireland
                Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux — or any of the other
                organisations that presented evidence — could quantify the
                extent of that need. They guessed that it is currently 200,000
                cases a year, but it could be as many as 400,000 cases each
                year. However, that was only a stab in the dark, and adequate
                research must be carried out to ascertain the level of need. We
                cannot make legislation, and we cannot recommend, or, indeed,
                fairly criticise legislation if we are unaware of the facts. As
                stated in recommendation 7, we need clarity on the criteria used
                to prioritise cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer Members to some of the Northern
                Ireland Court Service’s answers on the code of conduct. During
                their evidence sessions, I asked Mr Hunter of the Northern
                Ireland Court Service:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;What will the code of practice mean in
                real terms?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hunter replied:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I cannot say.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When asked if there were a timescale for the
                implementation of the code of practice, Mr Hunter went on to
                say:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We do not think that the code of
                practice will be at the top of the agenda.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that that is at the top of
                the agenda, because the public will then have the confidence to
                gauge whether the reform will work for the efficiency and
                effectiveness of a better system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take some exception to Alban Maginness’s
                comments. He said that the right of access to legal aid is being
                eroded. If the public takes a look at the yearly legal aid bill,
                they will treat it with great scepticism, as millions of pounds
                are being spent, and claimed, on legal aid. The profession must
                be funded, and civil aid has risen by 176% in the past 10 years
                while criminal aid has risen from £6 million in 1990 to £25
                million in this financial year. People will say that that is a
                heck of a lot of money. To assume that people are not being
                provided with access to justice is wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is abuse in the system, and that should
                be addressed. If it takes £25 million or £55 million to run a
                fair and transparent legal aid system, the money should be
                spent. However, we should not say that people cannot access the
                justice system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also wrong to say that lawyers will
                cherry-pick cases — some probably will, but many do, and
                would, give of their time if proper resources were provided to
                help people in real need. Alban&nbsp;Maginness is more entitled
                to criticise a profession from which he comes than I am.
                However, we must not tar the entire profession with the same
                brush.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the House backs the draft Order, we are
                endorsing a blank cheque based on the exchequer of uncertainty.
                We must say to the Government, &quot;This is bad law; take it
                away and consider the issues we have addressed, and attend to
                the vagaries so as to allow us to have a draft Access to Justice
                (Northern Ireland) Order that is appropriate to the needs of the
                people of Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I took a considerable time to introduce the
                motion, so I do not propose to take anything like as much time
                now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those who contributed to the debate.
                A general trend that ran through the comments reflects the Ad
                Hoc Committee’s deliberations and the questions that were
                posed to witnesses. Mr&nbsp;Alban&nbsp;Maginness described our
                approach to the draft Order as critical, but not destructive.
                That accurately summarised the Committee’s attitude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The essential affordability of legal services
                was referred to and was a continuum throughout the consultation
                process — such as it was. There is no doubt that the Committee’s
                overriding concern, which I hope and suspect is shared by the
                House, was the lack of a comprehensive consultation period. Mr
                Paisley Jnr spoke about the Parliamentary Secretary in the Lord
                Chancellor’s Department who said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I will pay particular attention to the
                views of the Northern Ireland Assembly.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now will be the testing time to see whether
                that is the case. We await the Government’s response to our
                representations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a consensus in the Committee on the
                &quot;no win, no fee&quot; tenet and what it means to the level
                of representation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The useful figures that the Committee
                received from the Northern Ireland Association of Citizens
                Advice Bureaux show that the success rate for those who have
                representation at tribunals is double that of those who do not.
                That is a clear demonstration of the advantage of having
                representation. All those issues have been addressed in the
                report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their contributions, and
                I hope that the report will receive unanimous support.</p>
