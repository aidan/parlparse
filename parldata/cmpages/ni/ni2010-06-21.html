    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Matters of the Day</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Saville Report</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Raymond McCartney has sought leave to make a statement on a  matter that fulfils the criteria set out in Standing Order 24. I will call Mr  McCartney to speak on the subject for up to three minutes. I will then call  representatives from each of the other parties, as agreed with the Whips. Those  Members will also have three minutes in which to speak on the matter. There  will be no opportunity for interventions, questions or a vote on the matter. I  will not take any points of order until the item of business has been  concluded. If that is clear, we will proceed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I want to extend our continuing  solidarity and support to the Bloody Sunday families and to all those who seek  truth and justice. Tony Doherty, whose father, Patrick, was one of those  murdered, said on the steps of the Guildhall last Tuesday that he had been  waiting 38 years to hear the words &ldquo;unjustified and unjustifiable&rdquo;. The truth  had finally come home. He spoke on behalf of the families, of all those who  marched on Bloody Sunday and of all those who campaigned to have the truth set  free. The Saville report lays bare the great lie of Bloody Sunday, when the  British military, political and judicial establishment came together to turn  those without blame into the accused and to exalt and honour those responsible  for murder and perjury.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last Tuesday, without equivocation, the dead and the  wounded were exonerated, their innocence declared. Those responsible, the  British Parachute Regiment and its masters, were deemed guilty and dishonoured.  Those of us in the Guildhall and in Guildhall    Square witnessed and shared in the triumph of  justice over injustice. We stood in admiration of those families as they  displayed great generosity in moments of great emotion. That generosity was  epitomised by their response to the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who  had apologised without equivocation for the British Government and state. Their  generosity was reciprocated by Bishop Ken Good, the Moderator of the  Presbyterian Church, Norman Hamilton, and the President of the Methodist Church, Paul Kingston, when they met the  families at the Bloody Sunday monument on Wednesday morning. Many others,  including the First Minister, may have held a different viewpoint but now  accept the findings of Saville, and that is how is should be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Saville report concluded that those who marched for  justice and civil rights on 30 January 1972 were vindicated. The closing words  of Tony Doherty&rsquo;s address echoed the words on one of the panels in the Museum of Free Derry that tells the story of Bloody  Sunday:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No one who struggles for justice is a stranger here.  No one who dies in the struggle for justice is forgotten here.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The events of 30 January 1972 were, undoubtedly, a tragedy for those who lost  their lives and their families. Several months ago, before the Saville report  had been published, I expressed that position during an Adjournment debate.  That was the one point of unanimity that spanned the political spectrum. For  many years, some of us have questioned the wisdom of setting up the Saville  Inquiry to investigate an incident of some 30 years&rsquo; vintage. The fact that it  cost nearly &pound;200 million is deplorable and scandalous. Unfortunately, Saville  did not lay out in detail why troops were on the ground that day &mdash; Saville did  not, but we will.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are those, some of whom are in the Chamber today, who  are trying to rewrite history. They try to suggest that the violence that  lasted for some 30 years started with Bloody Sunday. They do so in an attempt  to confer some form of bogus legitimacy on their campaign of murder, which  preceded that day and continued long thereafter. We will continue to ensure  that the truth is told about the violence that engulfed our country for so  long.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The truth is that murder, mayhem and terror were rife  before 30 January 1972. In the two and a half years that preceded that day, one  hundred people were murdered across Northern Ireland. In the four weeks  before that day, in Londonderry alone,  violence was carried out by the various factions of the IRA. There were nine  separate bomb attacks on commercial and security force premises, six separate  shooting incidents, including an 80-minute gun battle, and a number of  gelignite and nail bomb attacks. Much of the city lay in ruins; we did not need  Saville to tell us that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was also the despicable and cowardly murder of two  policemen. One of the weapons used that night was a sub-machine gun. I have  repeatedly said &mdash; it remains the case more than 30 years later &mdash; that we will  probably never know the truth of all that transpired on that day. Long before  the Saville Inquiry, one participant sought refuge in not answering questions  and did so again while in the witness box. Almost all of us want to move on and  put the past behind us, and we must do that. However, some people seem unable  to own up to the many bloody days of their past.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Last week&rsquo;s publication of the Saville report was ultimately about the families  who lost their loved ones on 30 January 1972. The conclusions reached by  Saville will, I hope, bring closure to those families after 38 years. It should  also bring closure to wider society. Those who have sought to use those events  to justify terrorism were refuted by Saville&rsquo;s findings, above all by his  judgement that neither the Westminster Government nor the Stormont Government  intended the Army to use lethal force on that day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The bloodiest year in the history of the Troubles was 1972,  when 496 people lost their life. Behind that statistic, sobering as it is, are  many hundreds of families whose lives were cruelly shattered by the violence  that was unleashed on our society. Without detracting from the loss of the  Bloody Sunday families, it would be an injustice for the House not to  acknowledge that many more families in Northern Ireland carry the scars of  their loss, and, in recent days, they have felt abandoned and forgotten.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The response in some quarters to Saville has resulted in  difficult questions being posed for us as a society. Any proposal of a truth  recovery exercise has been utterly compromised by the response of the deputy  First Minister and the republican movement. The cherry-picking and the  inability to accept key findings of Saville suggest that republicans are still  incapable of coming to terms with or providing an honest account of their role  in the Troubles. They campaign for more inquiries in order to provide  justification for their terrorism. I do not hear them campaigning for an  inquiry into the events of 27 and 28 June 1970, when the IRA killed two  innocent men &mdash; Jimmy McCurrie and Bobby Neill &mdash; on the Newtownards Road in Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Prime Minister said that there will be no  more open-ended and costly inquiries into the past. I entirely endorse that  view. A grievance-factory approach to the past will undermine any prospect of a  shared future. Acknowledging the loss experienced by too many families during  our Troubles, while paying particular gratitude for the sacrifices made by the  RUC and the Army and leaving questions about the past to the Historical  Enquiries Team (HET), it is time for us to move forward to build our shared  future. However, that will not be done if people persist in trying to  manufacture inquiries purely to justify their terrorism over 38 years. There is  no justification for it; there was no justification for it; and, as far as I am  concerned, I hope and pray that our Government will not concede to those  further demands.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  It is appropriate that we take time in this Chamber to mark the very  significant publication of the Saville report and the clear, unequivocal  apology that was given by David Cameron, the British Prime Minister. It is  important that we do so in this Chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker, because, on 1  February 1972, this Chamber heard other words about Bloody Sunday, of which I  have some samples. One Member said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I think the security forces were justified in taking  strong action against these gunmen and these bombers and others who were out to  make trouble in Londonderry on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent" style="page-break-after:avoid;">Another Member said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The paratroopers went in to make arrests after the  parade ban had been defied, after the people taking part had been turned away  from the barricade, after a cap had been knocked off a policeman, and they had  been fired upon.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Another Member said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I cannot help but say that no matter what the law had  been last Sunday &hellip; it would have ended in violence and disorder because those  who are behind this campaign sought disorder and were prepared to see their own  supporters die.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He also said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;While one should not prejudge the results of the  inquiry that is unfortunately now to take place, nevertheless it can be said  with some confidence that a number of those who died on Sunday were the victims  of I.R.A gunmen.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Chamber also heard a Member say:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am glad that the Prime Minister and all his  supporters are behind the men of the Parachute Regiment who went in to arrest  the stone-throwers&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That Member also said of the soldiers:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;They were ordered to fire only at those who were  armed or were throwing bombs, and they obeyed their orders. It gives me great  pleasure&mdash;that is, if there can be any pleasure in such circumstances&mdash;to realise  that the men who have been blamed throughout the world are being cleared by  this House.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that this House now clears the name of  those whom this House blamed on Bloody Sunday. I know that it was a different  House then, but it was in speeches within the walls of this Chamber that the  people who organised the march were being blamed and the people on the march &mdash;  the victims &mdash; were being blamed, while the people who carried out those  killings, who now stand condemned by Saville, were being praised and cleared by  this House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that this is a huge  achievement for the families of Bloody Sunday and all who have supported them.  It is also an achievement for the wounded who fought the battle to prove their  innocence. Last week was a step towards justice, but it was also a step towards  reconciliation, and we saw that by the very welcome actions of the three  Protestant church leaders the following day. That gesture of reconciliation, of  acknowledgement of innocence finally vindicated and of reaching to a future  should inspire all of us in this House, but &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We should do that mindful of all the innocent victims that there have been in  these Troubles, not just victims on Bloody Sunday but the many victims that  there have been from Bloody Sunday.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  There is absolutely no doubt that the events of last Tuesday were hugely  significant. There was significance in the publication of the Saville report,  which, as an official British government report, clearly stated that those who  died or were injured in Derry on Bloody Sunday  were innocent. The report may not have used that word, but it was entirely  appropriate that the relatives chose to use it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last Tuesday was also significant because the present Prime  Minister of the United Kingdom was prepared to acknowledge the wrong that was  done, and he spoke in very generous terms, which I believe can help to promote  the partnership and reconciliation that this society so badly needs. His  comments were unlike the quotations that Mr Durkan just gave us. In a  democracy, it is absolutely right that state organisations should be judged by  the highest standards. Indulging in &ldquo;whataboutery&rdquo; does nothing to help that  situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is welcome that we have seen the difference that 38  years have made and what is happening in this Chamber to cement that difference  into practice. Nonetheless, even as we seek to establish a different way of  working in this Building, we know that, in the wake of the Saville report,  other families are still suffering; they do not have the comfort that the relatives  of those who died in Derry on Bloody Sunday  now have as a result of a full inquiry and exoneration. The practical reality  is that we will never be able to give a full process of inquiry to all those  who suffered and to the relatives of all those who died. That sense of loss  will not be diminished by the knowledge that others received justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the wake of the Saville report, there is a clear need  for us to begin to address a range of legacy issues in a way that, up to now,  we have not done. That is a task for the Assembly, which represents the entire  community; for civic society, in particular the churches, and in recent days we  have seen signs of that being done by the churches; and for the UK Government,  who retain aspects of responsibility for dealing with the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year&rsquo;s report by the Consultative Group on the Past  set out proposals that afford us some opportunity to deal with outstanding  issues. The report focused a great deal on reconciliation and information  recovery, and it is a great pity that those who took offence at a particular  aspect of the report have been unable to look at it in the round and at the  possibilities it contains, because, in the absence of the report, the  Historical Enquiries Team, which is the only body that we currently have, is  incapable of meeting the needs of all victims. It is time that society,  together, engaged in the process of reconciliation and building a new way  forward.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Aughnacloy Bomb Alert</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Lord Morrow has sought leave to make a statement on a matter that  fulfils the criteria set out in Standing Order 24. I shall call Lord Morrow to  speak for up to three minutes on the subject. I shall then call a  representative of each of the other political parties, as agreed with the  Whips. Those Members will also have three minutes in which to speak on the  matter. There will be no opportunity for interventions, questions or a vote on  the matter, and I will not take any points of order until the item of business  has been concluded. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  As someone who was born a small number of miles from Aughnacloy, I look on the  area as my neighbourhood. Those responsible for the assault against the forces  of law and order are, to say the least, beneath contempt. They want to drag Northern Ireland backwards into death and  bloodshed, and I know that the whole community in Aughnacloy and, indeed,  throughout this part of the United    Kingdom is determined that they will not  succeed. They want to plunge Northern    Ireland back into misery and suffering, so,  for the sake of this generation, everyone in the House must ensure that that is  not allowed to happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A 300 lb bomb in Aughnacloy had the potential to kill and  maim many innocent people, including police officers, and to destroy many homes  and businesses. I am in no doubt that that is what the criminals wanted.  Fortunately, due to the professionalism of the police and the Army, they  failed. I publicly pay tribute to the community in Aughnacloy for how it dealt  with the attack. In particular, I pay tribute to the local churches, the Red  Cross and the Loyal Orders for opening their facilities to those who had to  vacate their home in the middle of the night. That was a real demonstration of  community spirit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP will continue to support the police as they work to  put those criminals out of business. Everyone in this House must join together  in that fight. No one wants to return to the days of crowds walking behind the  coffins of innocent people murdered by terrorists. I strongly appeal to the  House today to show unequivocal support to the forces and agencies of law and  order. Let there be no ambiguity in anything that anyone says here today that  would give those terrorists some comfort in the fact that they are now  allegedly fighting a war.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know who taught those people their skills. We know where  they got their skills from. It is time for this House to stand up united and  say that enough is enough. We now look to the Minister of Justice for new  measures to ensure that the cancer of terrorism does not take over, as it has  done for the past 35 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise to the House for not  being here at the beginning of Lord Morrow&rsquo;s contribution. It is breastfeeding  awareness week, and I was at an event in Dungannon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I put on record my condemnation of the attempted bomb  attack in Aughnacloy last week. As Lord Morrow said, there has been huge  disruption. A lot of people have been affected, including elderly people who  were put through the trauma of being evacuated from their home and had to spend  the night in temporary facilities and parents of young children who were in bed  sleeping when the call came to get out. I know one family whose children had a  school trip the next day. They did not have time to get anything organised or  gathered up. It really was a huge disruption.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am extremely glad that nobody was injured or killed in  the attempt to blow up Aughnacloy barracks last week. I am very grateful that  it was not successful. It shows that there is still certainly a difficulty in  areas like Aughnacloy and others. I assure the House that there is no  equivocation in my condemnation of that event. Maurice Morrow made a comment  about people being taught their skills. The past decade and more has shown that  we have been leading the way politically in trying to ensure that attacks like  this do not happen in the future. There is an onus on all of us to make  politics work and ensure that politics is seen to be working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue, like others in Sinn F&eacute;in, to play my part  in moving us towards a peaceful society. The people who carried out this attack  have no support in our community. I hope that it is the last attempt of its  kind that we see. Everybody in Aughnacloy deserves praise for the way in which  they handled what happened. They dealt with it with good grace. I am extremely  glad, as MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, that the attempt was unsuccessful.  I unreservedly condemn it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank Lord Morrow for raising this matter in the House this morning. I put on  record the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s condemnation of those who, last Thursday  evening, went about an attempt to murder and create destruction in the town of Aughnacloy. Thankfully  for everybody in this society, they did not succeed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was an absolute disgrace that the local residents had to  spend so much time out of their homes because of the attempt. Lord Morrow and I  spent quite a long time in Aughnacloy on Friday with those residents. I pay  tribute to them for how they dealt with the matter. They were put under extreme  pressure, and, like Lord Morrow, I thank the community associations, the  churches and the Loyal Orders for making their premises available. It was also  a disgrace to see young children &mdash; I spent some time with one who was only a  couple of weeks old &mdash; who were out of their houses for almost 24 hours because  of the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that these people woke up to the reality of this  society. The people who tried to do this are failures to their own community  and to the entire community. It is time that they recognised that. I will go  slightly further and say that there are people in that dissident republican  organisation who have former colleagues in this House &mdash; in Sinn F&eacute;in, to be  absolutely clear. It is time that the House went further than condemnation: it  is time that those former colleagues started giving appropriate and useful  information to the security services in the Province to allow them to deal  effectively, once and for all, with those republican terrorists, who are not  wanted in this society. I say again: they are a failure, we do not want them,  and it is time that they got offside.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  In joining in my party&rsquo;s condemnation of the incident, I express my sympathy to  the people who had the frightening experience of learning that there was a bomb  in the area. Those people, who included very young children and some elderly  members of the population, had the distressing episode of having to leave their  home for about 24 hours. Also during that 24-hour period, many hundreds of  people who travel daily to and fro through Aughnacloy going either north or  south to their work were inconvenienced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Abandoning such an explosive device was an act of madness  and completely irresponsible behaviour. Had it not been for good fortune and  divine intervention, lives would have been lost. This kind of violence is  pointless and futile. We all know that it has been rejected by the vast  majority and by all the elected representatives in the Assembly. Those carrying  out such actions still claim that it is the means to achieve a united Ireland, but their tactics and methods will  never achieve a united Ireland.  We must all use the democratic process to build a new Ireland that will  accommodate all our different identities, cultures and nationalities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank Lord Morrow for bringing the matter to the Floor of the Assembly. I do  not represent the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, although it is an  area that I know well. I want to make the wider point that these attacks can  occur and have occurred right across Northern Ireland. Recently, there  was a bomb attack on Palace Barracks in Holywood in my constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In responding to these incidents, we must acknowledge that  they are indiscriminate and have the potential to cause massive damage and  considerable loss of life. I acknowledge that there is great solidarity in the  face of adversity in those communities across Northern Ireland, not least in  Aughnacloy, which is backed up by their local representatives. We can take  great pride in that. It was a similar type of pride that kept this community  going through the darkest days of the Troubles that we hope are, mainly, behind  us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three types of response that society needs to  show the dissident republicans. First, we need a political response, which is  best seen through a unity of purpose in the Chamber, in ensuring that politics  works and can make a difference in this society. In doing that, we suck away  any oxygen of grievance that those people can cling to in trying to build up  their support in communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we need a policing and security response. We must  ensure that we give the police their rightful place as the lead force for  taking those people on. We must ensure that the proper resources are available  to the Chief Constable, on the basis of his professional judgement of what is  effective and what works, and that there is an intelligent and smart approach  to tackling these dissident republicans.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, we need a civic and community response. We must  encourage our communities to show solidarity and to rally round and lead those  who are being led astray back to the correct course and towards supporting the  rule of law, democracy and human rights. We must be aware of when young people  in particular are being exploited and be prepared to intervene to show them the  error of their ways. They must not be allowed to fall under the spell of people  who want to lead them into a life of misery and to bring further misery to our  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like all the other Members from  Fermanagh and South Tyrone who have spoken, I condemn this incident out of  hand. Similar events have taken place, and the misguided individuals who are  using the bomb and bullet must realise that those tactics have now passed and  there is now a new direction. All sides of the community no longer want any one  particular winner; they want to move forward through politics, and there are  enough political representatives in all areas to do that. The vast majority of  the population wants that and does not support such attacks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My heart goes out to the parents, children and elderly  people who had to leave their homes for a long time as a result of the bomb  alert. It caused a particular problem as this is a holiday time, and, because  things have moved so far forward, the children who were affected did not  understand why it had happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The misguided individuals who were responsible may have  some notion of republican rebellion, but that no longer counts. That approach  has gone with the wind, and the only way that they can help is to drop it  entirely. There is no room for it any more or any possibility that anything  like it will progress us one millimetre towards a united Ireland. Anyone  who analyses the situation will see that that is the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">These attacks affect tourism, jobs and future investment;  they do nothing to help us. There have been problems with the attributing of  blame for other attacks such as that which took place in Armagh  earlier this year. I hope that no one will try to make political gain from  these attacks.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>: I  will.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The time that it takes to bring the place back to normal is  very important to people. I condemn the incident outright.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Review of Prisons</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Justice that he wishes  to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a  statement on the review of the conditions of detention, management and  oversight of all prisons. As the House will be aware, the review is an action  that was identified in the Hillsborough agreement of 5 February 2010 for  inclusion in the addendum to the Programme for Government. Although I gave the  Committee for Justice a summary of my intentions in regard to the review when I  appeared before it, it is right that I should report its composition and terms  of reference in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am open to suggestions from the review team on  the modification of the terms of reference, the terms as I will present them to  that team are as follows:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To conduct a rolling review, in line with the  agreement at Hillsborough   Castle of 5 February  2010, encompassing the conditions of detention, management and oversight of all  prisons. The review is to report to the Minister of Justice.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">It is envisaged that the review will consist of several  stages. The first will include a review of the regime at Maghaberry Prison.  That will take account of: recent reports on Maghaberry (including the Criminal  Justice Inspectorate Northern Ireland /Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Prisons  inspection and the two Pearson reports); developments in both the integrated  and the separated regimes already in place and previous reviews of the regime;  the development plans already in hand by the Governor of Maghaberry, in  consultation with Prison Service management; and NIPS management&rsquo;s programme  for Workforce Reform and associated projects.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Second, the review will cover the remaining matters  identified in the Hillsborough Agreement, building on the work achieved in the  first stage. It is envisaged this stage may be in two strands. One strand would  include: issues specific to Magilligan Prison, including particularly the  replacement of the prison recognising that much of the accommodation and  infrastructure is not fit for purpose; and issues at Hydebank Wood relating in  particular to the development of the strategy for women offenders including the  scope for a discrete facility, and developments in relation to juvenile  offenders at Hydebank Wood in liaison with the Youth Justice Agency.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The second strand would consider wider issues  affecting the future development of the Northern Ireland Prison Service,  including its future composition and its culture and ethos.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The Review Team will draw on the extensive body of  work that has been undertaken by the Criminal Justice Inspectorate in its  consideration of the current issues facing the Prison Service. The Chief  Inspector of Criminal Justice will also act as an adviser to the Review on  these issues, including the current review of governance.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">In all its work, the Review Team will wish to take the  views of the full range of stakeholders, including prison management, staff,  trades unions, prisoner fora and other prisoner representative groups, and the  Assembly Justice Committee. It will also be informed by developments in Prison  Services across these islands.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">It is envisaged that the first stage of the review  should be reported to the Minister by autumn 2010 and the second stage by early  2011.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have sought to ensure that the review team has expertise  and input from across these islands. The review is an opportunity to examine  the issues innovatively and to draw on best practice more widely. Accordingly,  I am delighted that Dame Anne Owers has agreed to chair the review team. For  the past nine years, Dame Anne has served as HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, and  she will commence her new role when she steps down from that position shortly.  She brings to the review a wealth of relevant experience, not only as Chief  Inspector of Prisons but from the range of other positions that she has held.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dame Anne Owers will be joined by Mr Phil Wheatley, who is  the recently retired director general of the National Offender Management  Service. Prior to holding that position, Mr Wheatley was director general of HM  Prison Service, following an extensive career in that service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Fergus McNeill, who is a professor of criminology  and social work at Glasgow   University, has also  agreed to serve on the review team. He brings to the team his distinguished  experience as an academic and as a practitioner in the arena of offending and  criminal justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Leighton, who retired as Deputy Chief Constable of the  PSNI last year, will also join the team, bringing his experience of the Northern Ireland  criminal justice system and of the change programme that our policing service  has undergone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final member of the review team is Ms Clodach McGrory,  who recently completed 12 years as a sentence review commissioner. Ms McGrory  is a parole commissioner. Previously, she practised at the Northern Ireland Bar,  and she has served as a member of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human  Rights and the Irish Human Rights Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have announced the team today, it will not  formally start its work until July. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is an  impressive team with a very important and wide-ranging remit. I know that the  team will want to take the views of as wide a range of interested parties as possible,  not just from those in Northern    Ireland. I have, however, asked the team to  deliver the product in two stages, as I am keen to maintain the momentum. I  trust that the work of those experts will enable us all to achieve a new  consensus on the role of custody and its management as the Prison Service and  the wider system emerge from the legacy of the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me emphasise a few key points. First, I am not  announcing today a review that will specifically focus on separated conditions  of detention. It is important that the issues that are represented by only 5%  of the total prison population are considered in the wider context of all those  who are in custody. Secondly, I agree with the director general of the Prison  Service that the current arrangements for women at Hydebank Wood are not  appropriate for the longer term. It will be important for us all, guided by the  review ream, to think creatively to find ways to improve the current  arrangements within the likely available financial envelope. Thirdly, it  remains essential for Prison Service management and the Prison Officers&rsquo;  Association (POA) to work together to progress the development of the service  while the review is ongoing. I will not allow the review to distract the Prison  Service&rsquo;s attention from the many pressing actions that already await  implementation following previous reports by, for example, the Criminal Justice  Inspectorate and the Police Ombudsman.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I emphasise my earlier point that the review is an  opportunity to enable us all, including all of us in the Assembly, to achieve a  new consensus on how our Prison Service should develop for the future. I have  described the devolution of justice powers as an opportunity to reshape the  justice system to meet the needs of Northern Ireland for the decades  that lie ahead. This review is part of that project. Therefore, I encourage  everyone with an interest in ensuring that we make the most of that opportunity  to engage with the review and with the issues for which we in the Chamber have  now been given responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his  statement. The question of prisons is one of the Committee for Justice&rsquo;s key  priorities, and we recently visited Maghaberry prison to see and hear about  some of the issues that it faces. Given the number of reviews, inspections and  reports on the Prison Service, particularly on Maghaberry prison, that have  resulted in over 1,300 recommendations, many of which I understand have not yet  been implemented, will the Minister explain the rationale for yet another  review? Surely the issues are already clear, and surely it is now time to take  action to address the problems. I suspect that we do not need another review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister appears to have recognised the need for action  by emphasising that, while the review is ongoing, the Prison Service will press  ahead to implement the actions that were recommended in previous reports. How  does the instigation of another review sit comfortably with that position?  Furthermore, will the Minister outline the expected cost of the review and  clarify whether it will be funded from the Department of Justice&rsquo;s existing  budget? Finally, will he be more precise about the timescale? When exactly in  the autumn is the report on the first stage of the review due?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Lord Morrow for his welcome of the statement, even if he  subsequently asked some difficult questions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The simple answer to the question of why another review is  necessary is because, at Hillsborough at the beginning of the year, we  recognised the need to bring together in a comprehensive way a range of reviews  that have been carried out and the need to look in a wider and more inclusive  way at how we implement the necessary reforms to the Prison Service. I sought  to establish as broad a review team as possible to bring together a range of  expertise and different experiences to ensure that we could learn lessons from  some existing reviews and, as Lord Morrow correctly said, at the same time  ensure that outstanding matters from the previous reviews were implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review will bring together, in an overarching way, some  of the existing recommendations. The review will be considered in the new light  of the context of devolution and the opportunities that that presents, as well  as in the light of our current difficult financial circumstances. In response  to Lord Morrow&rsquo;s final question, I cannot provide the cost, but I assure him  that it will be met within the Department&rsquo;s existing budget. I am afraid that I  cannot give him a precise indication of what we mean by autumn 2010 to early  2011, but, from my brief conversation this morning with the members of the  review team with whom I will engage in more detail later this afternoon, I am  certain that they are committed to ensuring that the review is not dragged out  and that it meets the correct balance between doing a thorough job and doing a  speedy job.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I call the next Member to speak, I remind Members that the  flexibility that is given to the Chairperson does not extend to the rest of the  Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  That is disappointing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim  bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an r&aacute;iteas sin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I, too, welcome the review and the fact that the first  stage of it will centre on Maghaberry prison. Notwithstanding that, there are  issues in other prisons, but the reports on Maghaberry require immediate  attention. In saying that, I understand the third bullet point in the  ministerial statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What steps will the Minister take to ensure that when the  review is taking place, it is not seen as a break from dealing with the already  pressing issues that exist in Maghaberry and, in particular, in Roe House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr McCartney for his kind words. He raised an entirely  valid point regarding how we ensure that the necessary reform work is done  while the review is being carried out. The Prison Service was already engaged  in work in conjunction with various partners to ensure that some of the  necessary reforms from previous recommendations, particularly the response from  Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) to the Criminal Justice  Inspectorate, were carried through. It is my intention to ensure that that work  continues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member highlighted the difficulties at Roe House. As he  is well aware, there has been significant engagement in an attempt to resolve  the outstanding difficulties with republican separated prisoners, but I regret  that, to date, those efforts have not resulted in the suspension of action by  prisoners and the restoration of the normal regime. However, I assure Mr  McCartney and the House that Prison Service management is determined to ensure  that those matters are resolved as speedily as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Does he agree that we all owe prison  officers a huge debt of gratitude for the work that they have carried out for  this society, sometimes in the midst of a threat to their lives and that of  their families? Furthermore, what significant points will we get out of the  review, given that there has been a number of other reviews in the Prison  Service over the years? What will be different about this review?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I agree with Mr Elliott that we all owe a debt of gratitude to the  prison officers who served this society in the past, along with a range of  other public servants. We should not underestimate the difficult circumstances  that some of them are working under at the moment, given that threats to  certain named prison officers are continuing from small groups of prisoners and  some of their associates outside. Therefore, we must recognise that that is  part of the reality in which they work. We also need to recognise that prisons  have a task of rehabilitating offenders and reducing offending in the future by  ensuring that recidivism rates are reduced significantly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a real challenge for all prison staff to ensure  that they meet the needs of society in the different circumstances in which  they find themselves now from that in which many of them were recruited in the  1970s and 1980s when there was a different task to be performed. Therefore,  although we recognise the work that prison officers do, it does not mean that  they do not face the same challenge as many others connected with the criminal justice  system face in adjusting to the new realities, issues and demands of this  society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott asked me what significant points will come out  of the review. I set up the review to find out the recommendations from a body  of experts, and it would be foolish to second-guess the outcome before they  have commenced work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that it is time to fundamentally review not only what  prisons do today but what they should do in the future and the role that they  play? Does he agree that the review that he announced today is neither  fundamental nor sufficiently deep to be able to meet either of those two  objectives and that it will not go beyond addressing some of the immediate  problems that exist in all our prisons, when, in fact, it needs to do the  opposite and address the fundamental relationship between us, as a region, our  prisons and the people who run them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr McDevitt has to acknowledge that we are seeking, at this stage,  to make some significant steps forward in the Prison Service, while recognising  that there are more fundamental issues. However, when we start talking about  fundamental reviews, we are in danger of suggesting that the Prison Service  could have a Patten done to it, for example, as was done to the policing  service. That is not an option in the financial resources that we have  available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Member&rsquo;s point that the functions of prisons  and of the entire criminal justice system in promoting reform and public  protection are real issues for this society, but, frankly, they are issues for  every part of these islands and for every part of western society. It is not  something that I expect the review team, which was set up with a specific remit  to look at the management and operation of the Prison Service in Northern Ireland,  to achieve within a period of less than a year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I invite the Minister to join me in  paying tribute to the work of Robin Masefield, who has announced his intention  to step down as director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service. Will  the Minister set out how a reformed prison service fits into his wider vision  for the criminal justice system, particularly with regard to a more effective  way of dealing with the management of offenders and with note taken of Phil  Wheatley&rsquo;s background in the national offender management service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank my friend for his complimentary remarks; I would expect  nothing less. Unfortunately, I fear that he wants me to write his next PhD  thesis on the role of a reformed prison service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Not another one.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Not another one, as Mr McDevitt says.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is entirely right that I should pay tribute to the work  of Robin Masefield as director general of the Prison Service. Robin publicly  announced his pending retirement last week. He was not pushed; he announced to  me two or three weeks ago that he was proposing to go. Towards the end of his  Civil Service career, he was appointed to a four-year post as director general  of the Prison Service. He agreed to do a fifth year and, subsequently, to do a  sixth year to carry the Prison Service through the process of devolution. To  suggest that a man of retirement age who is leaving his position, having done  two extra years, is somehow being pushed is, I think, somewhat twisting the  position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Prison Service&rsquo;s role within the  criminal justice system in promoting wider reforms, it is clear that, due to  the historical background of the Prison Service, we have significant costs  associated with the management of prisons and significant difficulties in the  prison estate, because some buildings are legacies of the past and need to be  replaced. We have to balance all that against the financial resources that are  available, as we seek to ensure that those who enter prisons come out reformed  and not likely to re-engage in crime at the rate in which, unfortunately, they  currently do. Those are massive challenges for the criminal justice system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the cost per prisoner place, at  &pound;77,000 a year, is way ahead of any other region of these islands, and there is  no doubt in my mind that we need to ensure that we get the best possible value  for money out of that. That said, having visited Hydebank Wood and Maghaberry,  I have seen the positive and constructive work that is being done to engage  with offenders in prison to seek to promote rehabilitation. In Maghaberry, for  instance, the REACH landing, in seeking to work with the most vulnerable of  prisoners, is to be commended against any other prison on these islands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the youth justice system, work is also being done to  recognise that although some young offenders go to Hydebank Wood rather than to  the juvenile justice centre, opportunities are available to work with them in a  different way. The work being done in the women&rsquo;s unit in Hydebank Wood, Ash  House, is another example of extremely good and positive rehabilitation work.  We should not underestimate progress that is being made, but, at the same time,  we must recognise that much more needs to be done.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Will the Minister join me in acknowledging the significant work that the men  and women of our Prison Service have done to date, in difficult circumstances,  with courage and commitment to their vocation? Will he also assure us that the  review of prisons will build on the progress that has already been made, as has  been outlined, on the issue of women offenders and, in particular, by the youth  justice system, which has made significant progress in reducing reoffending?  Furthermore, does he agree that the review should particularly target prisons  that house young offenders to ensure that, as far as possible, once those  prisoners leave, they do not go back again?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Bell for his good wishes. If he wishes me to repeat the  tribute that I paid to prison staff when I responded to Mr Elliott&rsquo;s question,  I will happily do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He asked specific questions about building on the work  being done with women and young offenders. He is absolutely right: some very  positive work has been done in those areas. When I spoke in the House about my  first week in office, I mentioned my visit to the Inspire Women&rsquo;s Project in Belfast, which has links  with Ash House and works to promote rehabilitation and to reduce reoffending by  women prisoners. There is no doubt that good work is being done there. There  are issues that need to be addressed around the possibilities for capital for  the development of a dedicated women&rsquo;s prison, but the work is being done as  best it can be within the facilities that we have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bell also mentioned youth offending. We are seeing  circumstances now in which the vast majority of young offenders are  accommodated in the juvenile justice centre. There are those who, for various  reasons, require the stricter regime in Hydebank Wood. However, I hope to make  an announcement fairly soon about the increased involvement of the Youth  Justice Agency so that the best possible conditions are put in place to ensure  that when people are in custody, they are put onto the path of not reoffending  when they are released.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the review, which is  timely. Some of the questions that I wanted to ask have already been answered,  but I want to ask one of them for the record. The Minister said that prisoner  forums will have an opportunity to feed into the consultation on the review.  What shape will that input take? Will each house, for example, in Maghaberry, be  represented? The Minister mentioned the people who are involved in the REACH  landing programme in Lagan House. How will they be facilitated throughout the  review process?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Health Minister responded to a question from  the Minister&rsquo;s colleague Stephen Farry by accusing him of putting prisoners&rsquo;  concerns to the forefront rather than those of patients. For the record, I want  the Minister to make it clear that prisoners can also be patients, and that  prisoners who are recipients of healthcare should not be treated in an  arbitrary fashion, as has been the case in the past.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I welcome Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n&rsquo;s comments. There is absolutely no doubt  that some very positive work is being done on prison healthcare by the South  Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, which is the responsible agency. When I  visited Maghaberry, I was able to meet some of the people from the South  Eastern Trust who provide that healthcare. It is absolutely vital that  prisoners, like everyone else in society, get proper healthcare. There is still  work to be done, particularly on mental health, which is not being addressed as  well as we hoped it might be. I have no doubt that that issue will feed into  the review, but progress has been made in recent years in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was not in the Chamber to hear the exchange between  Stephen Farry and the Health Minister. If it was in anything like the terms in  which Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n described, I will align myself with Stephen Farry, which is  no great surprise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n also asked a specific question about the  operation of prisoner forums. As I understand it, there is a prisoner forum in  each unit in Maghaberry. It is the intention that those forums should have the  opportunity to feed into the review. However, I will write to Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  outlining the precise details of the operation of those forums, because I do  not have them in front of me.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  add my name to those who have paid tribute to prison officers for their work  over many difficult years and in the most horrible of circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the Justice Committee&rsquo;s trip to Maghaberry, I was  struck by the fact that many of the education and skills workshops were not in  operation that day because of staff shortages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that it is not only the level of  sickness among staff in the prison that needs to be addressed, but the fact  that so many prisoners refuse to enter into educational workshops or skills  workshops, and by doing so are making it more difficult for themselves to  reintegrate into society and get a good start and make progress in life by  finding a job when they get out of prison again?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Ross for his good wishes. Do I need to repeat my  tribute to prison officers every time a unionist asks me questions? I will  happily do so if they wish me to. The Member referred to staff shortages and  sickness rates, as well as the issue of prisoners refusing opportunities for  education. It is deeply sad if the opportunities that are made available in  prison for prisoners to better themselves are not fully taken up. There are  reasons at times why staff shortages prevent prisoners from moving around the  prison properly. Those need to be addressed, and we need to move in a way that  ensures the best possible use of all of those rehabilitation opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that those who take opportunities  provided for education are less likely to reoffend when they come out of  prison, and are more likely to make the transition to civil society without  difficulties. At this stage I cannot go into the precise details as to how  individuals do not get there on particular days, but as a general principle we  need to ensure that that working system is improved so that every prisoner who  wishes to avail himself or herself of education and other facilities gets that  opportunity, and that the maximum possible efforts are made to encourage them  to take it up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  My question is on education. Given that more than 60% of inmates have serious  problems with literacy and numeracy, can the Minister reassure the House that  the review will look closely at the programmes and levels of education that are  available? Secondly, the report mentions the replacement of Magilligan Prison &mdash;  does that also include a review of the location of it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Mr Dallat for his question. The answer is that the review  is of the conditions of detention, management and oversight of all prisons.  That will include every aspect of the management of prisons, including  education services. The Member is absolutely right about the major difficulties  that we suffer because of the low educational achievement of many prisoners.  There are real issues about ensuring that they take the opportunity to better themselves  and to use the education classes that are there. I am quite sure that the  review team will be looking at that as part of its overall work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also talked about the issue of a replacement for  Magilligan. That is currently under consideration by the Prison Service  management. There will be business cases looking at possible alternatives as to  how Magilligan is replaced, because DFP rules require that every possible  opportunity be considered. That work is currently under way, and will be  reported alongside the work of the review team on dealing with the management  of prisons.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I too welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and wish him every success as the review  progresses. What attention will be given to reviewing mental health services  within the Prison Service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank my colleague for his further good wishes. He has  highlighted &mdash; in a way that I perhaps should have emphasised more to C&aacute;ral N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n &mdash; the fact that mental health services are a vitally important part of  the health services provided in prisons. Not only do we know that in many cases  prisoners have very low educational achievements, but there is also a very high  rate of mental health problems and personality disorders in prisons. We will not  ensure that we protect society by enabling people to go on the right path when  they leave prison if we do not provide the mental health services that are  needed in prison.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Good work has already started since the South Eastern Trust  took over responsibility. That work is currently being reviewed, but there is  no doubt whatsoever that there will need to be a greater investment in prison  healthcare, especially mental health, if we are to ensure the best possible  services to protect the wider community and promote rehabilitation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  welcome the review and thank the Minister for his statement. I am particularly  interested in the team&rsquo;s remit for reviewing issues at Hydebank relating to the  development of the strategy for women offenders. Will the Minister assure me  that the team will look at the problems in Hydebank relating to mental health  and alcohol and drug addiction, as well as at training opportunities for  prisoners to prevent them from reoffending?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank Ms Lo for her good wishes. The review team will look at  every aspect of Hydebank Wood. The first phase of the review will concentrate  on Maghaberry prison; the second will look at Magilligan prison and Hydebank  Wood.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the women prisoners in Hydebank Wood  have particular needs. The management needs of women prisoners tend to be very  different from those of male prisoners; therefore, considerable work will have  to be done to ensure that the best possible regime is in place for them.  Although only a small number of women prisoners &mdash; between 30 and 50 &mdash; is there  at any one time, it is nonetheless a significant group with particular needs. I  am, therefore, determined to ensure that we provide the best possible  facilities for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the director general had wished to see  movement on a purpose-built facility specifically for women, and although that  is not possible at this stage, it must be kept under consideration. I have seen  the work that has been done in Ash House, and there is no doubt that the best  possible work must continue to be done in whatever buildings are provided.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning &nbsp;(Sir Reg Empey)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Employment (No. 2) Bill  [NIA 24/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill builds on the outcomes of a comprehensive review  of the current statutory dispute resolution procedures and represents the  starting point for the introduction of a package of legislative and  non-legislative measures that are designed to change the way in which workplace  disputes in Northern Ireland  are resolved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the conduct of the review, employers and employer  representative bodies expressed, in very clear terms, their concerns about  existing arrangements. Employers consistently argued for change that would  reduce the financial and opportunity costs associated with the resolution of  disputes that escalate beyond the workplace. The Bill, and the other planned  measures, will generate substantive improvements to the efficiency and  effectiveness of the current systems for resolving disputes and will further  support our drive for increased competitiveness. Similarly, employee  representative groups argued for improvements that would provide less formal  alternatives to the tribunal system, while preserving citizens&rsquo; fundamental  right to access the justice system. Again, the Bill, and the other planned  measures, will go a long way to achieving those objectives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before dealing with the Bill&rsquo;s main provisions, it is  important to set the context in which the review was conducted and to  acknowledge the role of stakeholders in ensuring that the public consultation  generated informed debate around how the existing system should be improved. In  Great Britain,  following the Gibbons review, a decision was made to repeal the full statutory  procedures governing workplace disputes. There was always the temptation for Northern Ireland  to default to the GB position. However, I took the view that it was important  to explore other delivery options to provide the necessary assurance that the  needs of the Northern    Ireland economy and citizens&rsquo; rights were  being properly considered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not need to rehearse in detail the arguments about the  heavy concentration of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Northern Ireland.  However, it is worth restating that a recurring theme throughout the  consultation process was the challenges that SMEs face in dealing with the  complexity of employment law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that the review was fit for purpose, it was vital  to seek the views of what is a very diverse stakeholder community. Therefore,  at the outset, I decided to establish a consultation steering group with  representation from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Federation  of Small Businesses (FSB), the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress  of Trade Unions (NICICTU), the Equality Commission and the Labour Relations  Agency (LRA). I put on record my appreciation of the excellent work that the  steering group has undertaken on behalf of the Department and, more  importantly, Northern Ireland plc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The steering group was charged with the responsibility for  overseeing every aspect of the public consultation process and, at all times,  acted corporately in ensuring that the consultation process was comprehensive  and inclusive. Not only did the steering group offer insightful and measured  advice and direction, but it was instrumental in ensuring that the consultation  process garnered the views of practitioners and interest groups through the  establishment of a series of expert user panels. That unique partnership  approach to public consultation has shown the clear benefits of working closely  with key stakeholders to develop regional solutions that address, equitably,  the needs of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s citizens and businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the work of the Committee for Employment and  Learning, which further underscored the importance of developing systems that  encourage the prevention and early resolution of workplace disputes. During the  public consultation, the Committee commissioned its own study, taking evidence  from a wide range of stakeholders. The Committee&rsquo;s measured report offered a  series of conclusions that I found particularly helpful when I was considering  policy options. I know that the Committee will be equally assiduous in its  consideration of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At an early stage of the policy review, the consultation  steering group established a set of guiding principles that I was more than  happy to endorse. Those principles included the promotion of good employment  relations that encouraged competitiveness; the provision of strong employment  rights to preserve citizen access to the justice system; effective mechanisms  to prevent and resolve workplace disputes; the availability of non-adversarial  alternatives to the tribunal system; and an efficient and effective tribunal  system. Those principles are the template that has guided the policy proposals  that underpin the provisions in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now outline what the Bill is designed to achieve. It  contains 18 clauses and four schedules that will: establish a less legalistic  framework for raising workplace grievances while leaving intact a minimum legal  standard for disciplinary and dismissal situations; repeal the confusing  provisions that link grievance and disciplinary processes with industrial  tribunal and fair employment tribunal time limits; enable the Labour Relations  Agency (LRA) to exercise greater discretion in offering its assistance to  resolve disputes while removing time restrictions for LRA conciliation; amend  industrial tribunals&rsquo; powers to reach a determination without a hearing where  the parties consent; modify industrial tribunals&rsquo; powers to restrict publicity  in sensitive cases; provide for the enforcement of tribunal awards without the  need for a court order and make similar provisions for conciliated settlements  that have been achieved with the support of the Labour Relations Agency; enable  the Fair Employment Tribunal to hear aspects of cases that currently require a  separate industrial tribunal hearing; and introduce the legislative framework  for the right to request time to train.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now expand on each area covered by the Bill. First,  I will address procedures for resolving disputes in the workplace. Employers  and employees are currently required to follow statutory minimum procedures  when a formal dispute arises in the workplace. The procedures apply to both  employee grievances and disciplinary or dismissal actions taken by an employer.  Unreasonable failure to follow those procedures has implications for any  subsequent tribunal proceedings. Following my Department&rsquo;s review, I propose to  retain the statutory proceedings that relate to disciplinary and dismissal situations.  However, at the same time, I will be seeking to repeal the statutory procedures  associated with workplace grievances. Repealing the statutory minimum grievance  procedures will afford employers and employees more flexibility in dealing with  disputes, reduce unnecessary formality and remove regulatory burdens from  business, including costs of around &pound;1&middot;5 million per annum that are associated  with operating the statutory grievance procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consensus from the public consultation was that the  statutory grievance procedures, although well intentioned, militated against  the early and informal resolution of grievances. Although it is appropriate to  bring forward that repeal, it is equally appropriate to retain the statutory  minimum process for disciplinary and dismissal situations. It is important that  employers, especially the large number of micro-employers and SMEs in Northern  Ireland that do not have dedicated HR specialists, clearly understand their  obligations in those very serious circumstances when an employee&rsquo;s dismissal is  being contemplated or has taken place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having in place a minimum legal standard protects not only  the employee from unfair action but the employer from the legal consequences of  such action. The retention of the disciplinary and dismissal element of the  statutory procedures and the repeal of the statutory grievance element offers  the best accommodation of the two principles established by the consultation  steering groups; namely, the provision of strong employment rights and the  promotion of good employment relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards grievances, a revised Labour Relations Agency  code of practice will replace the statutory process with a good practice  standard, which will remove much of the complexity and undue formality of the  current system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to note that stakeholders have commended the  work of the Labour Relations Agency on the matter of pre-claim conciliation.  However, they have called for a more proactive approach to early interventions  designed to resolve disputes. Skilled agency conciliators can help to avert  unnecessary legal proceedings by helping those facing a dispute to find common  ground and mutually acceptable solutions. To that end, the Bill contains minor  legislative amendments that will provide the agency with greater flexibility,  thus freeing conciliation officers to target help where it will be most  effective. Those provisions, along with a range of non-legislative measures,  including an enhanced helpline, will strengthen the agency&rsquo;s ability to help  parties to resolve disputes before they reach a tribunal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to post-claim conciliation. Once a tribunal  claim is lodged, there are, in many cases, time limits on the period during  which the Labour Relations Agency has a duty to offer conciliation. The review  has shown that those time limits have not been effective, and the Bill seeks to  remove them. That will strengthen the agency&rsquo;s remit in offering its services  throughout the lifetime of a dispute. The agency will also be encouraged to  target those disputes that are likely to be amendable to conciliation at that  later stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to industrial tribunals and the Fair Employment  Tribunal. Currently, it is not possible for a fair employment case that also  involves certain industrial tribunal jurisdictions to be consolidated and heard  by the Fair Employment Tribunal. As a result, a separate industrial tribunal  must be convened to hear those residual issues, even though that hearing will,  essentially, deal with the same set of facts. That duplication places additional  time and resource pressures on the tribunal system and the parties involved in  the case. The Bill seeks to widen the powers of the Fair Employment Tribunal so  that the fair employment and all other aspects of a claim can be heard by the  same tribunal as part of the same proceedings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The dispute resolution review also produced evidence of the  need for a range of additional efficiency measures designed to improve the  operation of the tribunal system. Therefore, in the Bill, I have included  measures to simplify time limits for lodging a tribunal claim; introduce a more  efficient process for enforcing unpaid tribunal awards; allow for restricted  reporting of sensitive cases; and, where the parties agree, allow simple cases  to be determined in writing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill seeks to establish a legislative framework that  would allow for the subsequent introduction of a right to request time to  train. That proposed new right, which has already been introduced in Great Britain,  would give employees with the requisite length of service a statutory  entitlement to make a formal request to their employer for time to undertake  work-related training.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The right, modelled on the well-established and successful  flexible working arrangements, would place a duty on employers to consider a  request seriously but with the facility to turn it down on one or more of a  specified list of business grounds. Although reaction to the right has been  essentially positive, I am acutely aware of concerns in the business community  about the introduction of the right at this time of economic hardship.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill seeks to establish only the enabling power that  will allow for the subsequent introduction of a right to request time to train.  There will still be the requirement to make subordinate legislation before that  new right can be introduced. I assure Members that I will take no further  action to effect its subsequent introduction until economic conditions are  sufficiently favourable, taking account of factors such as unemployment rates  and current and projected economic growth rates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also intend the new right to be introduced on a phased  basis. In the first year of operation, it will apply only to firms that employ  50 or more employees. It will be extended to cover all employees in the  following year. The correlation between a well-trained workforce and  competitiveness is well established, and that will be the primary focus of the  proposed new right. Many employers already facilitate requests to train. The  new right will provide a public endorsement of that good practice and help to  promote the value of training to organisations in which a learning culture does  not exist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains a range of measures to which the Assembly  will wish to give careful consideration. It will allow for a less legalistic  approach to workplace grievances by repealing the current statutory grievance  procedures. It will provide greater flexibility for the Labour Relations Agency  to deliver an enhanced conciliation service. It will introduce a range of  efficiency measures to improve the operation of the current tribunal system,  and it will establish a framework for a new right to request time to train.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Minister, in his response to the proposed new  right to request time to train, indicated his expectation that any associated  costs will be met from within existing and future allocations. I am supportive  of the Minister&rsquo;s position and want to assure the House that costs relating not  just to the right to request time to train but to the wider dispute-resolution  measures will be accommodated within existing and future departmental  allocations. On the subject of finance, it is worth mentioning again that the  proposed deregulation of the current statutory grievance procedures will mean  an annual saving of &pound;1&middot;5 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have already indicated, the policy review, in addition  to the provisions that are set out in the Bill, has identified a range of  non-legislative measures that will bring substantial improvements to the way in  which disputes are dealt with in Northern Ireland. Those legislative measures  include the establishment of an inter-agency employment relations information  forum; an agreed code of practice for all information providers; the  development of an employment relations good-practice model; and accredited professional  development programmes in employment relations for general management  disciplines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to listening to Members&rsquo; comments in today&rsquo;s  debate, and I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I apologise for  my delayed arrival. As Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning, I thank the Minister for his explanation of the Bill. The Minister  has gone into the provisions of the Bill in some detail, and the Committee has  done extensive pre-legislative work in close partnership with the relevant  stakeholders and the Department. Once again, the Committee has led the way in  partnership working with the Department and stakeholders, and the results are  plain to see.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, the First Stage took place on 25 May,  and the Committee Stage will begin tomorrow, Tuesday 22 June. The Committee  began taking briefings on workplace dispute resolution and alternative dispute  resolution in November 2008, following the Department&rsquo;s public consultation on  the issue. The Committee immediately began to take evidence from key  stakeholders, which it drew together with its conclusions in a Committee report  on workplace dispute resolution. The Committee issued that report towards the  end of the last session.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials have been in constant contact with  the Committee and have briefed members on a number of occasions. The Minister&rsquo;s  commitment to working in partnership was clear from the beginning of the  process. His indication that he had no preconceived ideas on how the work  should turn out allowed the Committee and key stakeholders truly significant  input to the Bill. I commend the Minister and his officials for adopting that  thoroughly practical and sensible approach. It is a useful approach that other  Departments could adopt and learn from. I also thank Committee staff, past and  present, for their considerable efforts to support the Committee in its work  over the last 18 months.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The objective of the Committee&rsquo;s report was to collate and  consider the opinions and views of relevant stakeholder organisations on a way  forward for workplace dispute resolution in Northern Ireland. Based on the  evidence that was received and taking on board members&rsquo; views, the Committee  realised that there is a need to develop and promote a culture of early dispute  resolution as the most appropriate approach, as opposed to people seeking legal  redress through the tribunal system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also agreed that there is a need to reform  the current statutory procedures, ensuring that any revised system is properly  thought through and that it represents a synergy of the best of the current  system with the best of the options for change. In short, the new system should  ensure the protection of individuals&rsquo; and employers&rsquo; rights and their access to  justice. The Bill largely represents the outcome of that process, and members  are, therefore, generally content with its provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed fully with those who gave evidence to  the effect that alternative dispute resolution should be promoted as the most  appropriate alternative to tribunals to protect the privacy of those involved  and to ensure the pursuit of a faster, more flexible and more cost-effective  means of settling a grievance, especially given the current economic climate.  That is worth noting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also agreed with a number of witnesses who  stated that the role of the Labour Relations Agency should be extended to cover  a wider range of advice and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services and  that there is a need for the LRA&rsquo;s resources to be refocused so that it can  provide such extended services. Again, it can be seen that the Bill reflects  those views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed with the witnesses who identified the  importance of the tribunal system, but it also took on board the concerns that  employers and employees have about that system. Members felt that there is a  need to ensure that dispute resolution is made simpler and less bureaucratic  for both employer and employee and that a revised system does not simply  replace one set of complex and confusing rules and regulations with another  that is not user-friendly. It is hoped that the Bill will facilitate that, and  that appears to be the case. However, the Committee will bottom out those  issues during the Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee strongly believes that the provision of more  accessible information and the promotion of a clearer understanding of employer  and employee rights and obligations by all those involved are central to the  success of any revised system. Lack of accurate information and clear  instructions for those participating in the current structures, particularly  SMEs, was a recurring theme that all those who gave evidence raised. That issue  needs to be addressed for the revised system to be meaningful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is of the opinion that the public sector  plays an extremely important role in the process, first, by ensuring that it  leads the way in developing best practice models, and secondly, by leading by  example through implementing those models.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee took evidence from the Department, the Labour  Relations Agency, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Equality Commission,  the Confederation of British Industry, the Northern Ireland Committee of the  Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Law Centre Northern Ireland. Based  on the evidence received and on members&rsquo; own views, the Committee agrees that  there is a need to develop and promote a culture of early dispute resolution,  as opposed to seeking legal redress through the tribunal system. Much work will  be needed to change the current mindset.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of its evidence gathering, the Committee saw and  heard about the benefits and drawbacks of implementing a rights commissioner  system, and it feels that such a system is not currently an option that should  be pursued.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to have a timely and early dispute  resolution system. It must be implemented; it is not enough to have it as an  objective, and there has to be some means of tracking it to ensure that it is  being implemented. The public sector needs to step up to the mark on that,  because I know of several cases that have taken a very long time to be  resolved, and some have even taken a long time to be just looked at informally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The part of the Bill that the Committee did not examine in  its investigation is the time to train provision. Members have previously  discussed the issues about workers getting new skills and upgrading existing  skills, and that is something that members support. It is important that  employers are encouraged to upskill their workers. England,  Scotland and Wales have  adopted that provision, and we believe that, if used properly, it has  considerable potential.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There were some concerns raised via the Department&rsquo;s  consultation. The Committee&rsquo;s greatest concern is the opposition of the  Federation of Small Businesses to the time to train provision. Members  understand the concerns that SMEs have about workers taking time off to train,  but reskilling and upskilling are probably the best ways for SMEs to evolve and  grow. However, the Committee believes that that provision must be monitored and  reviewed and that support and information for SMEs must be readily accessible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process for workplace dispute resolution was introduced  on 3 April 2005 and gave new rights and responsibilities to employers and  employees in Northern    Ireland; however, it has proved problematic.  Gibbons&rsquo;s review of the system in GB was followed by a consultation and a  decision was made to pursue reform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will reform the workplace dispute resolution  process and introduce the right to request time to train by: leaving intact the  statutory regime for disciplinary and dismissal situations while moving to a  less legalistic framework, for the reason of workplace grievances involving  voluntary compliance with the appropriate Labour Relations Agency code of  conduct; repealing provisions linking grievance and disciplinary or dismissal  process with industrial tribunal and Fair Employment Tribunal time limits;  enabling the Labour Relations Agency to exercise greater discretion in offering  its assistance to resolve disputes; repealing time restrictions on the period  of Labour Relations Agency conciliation; amending industrial tribunals&rsquo; powers  to reach a determination without a hearing; modifying industrial tribunals&rsquo; powers  to restrict publicity; providing that tribunal awards, once registered, are  enforceable without the need to obtain a court order and make similar provision  in relation to conciliated settlements reached with the assistance of the  Labour Relations Agency; enabling the Fair Employment Tribunal to hear aspects  of fair employment cases that would previously have necessitated a separate  industrial tribunal hearing; and introducing a legislative framework for a  right to request a time to train.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains 18 clauses and three schedules. As the  Minister has outlined those extensively, I merely remind Members what they are.  Clause 1 provides for repeal of statutory grievance procedures. Clause 2 makes  provision for statutory dispute resolution procedures with respect to their  effect on contracts of employment. Clause 3 makes provision for statutory  dispute resolution procedures with respect to consequential adjustments of time  limits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 4 deals with non-compliance with statutory codes of  practice. Clause 5 deals with the determinations of industrial tribunal  proceedings without hearing. Clause 6 makes provision for the restriction of  publicity with regard to industrial tribunals. Clause 7 deals with the  enforcement of sums payable with respect to awards payable made by industrial  tribunals. Clause 8 makes provision for conciliation before the bringing of  proceedings to tribunal. Clause 9 makes provision for conciliation after the  bringing of proceedings to tribunal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 deals with the recovery of sums payable under  compromises involving the Labour Relations Agency. Clause 11 makes provision  for the powers of the Fair Employment Tribunal in relation to matters within  the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals. Clause 12 deals with conciliation  before the bringing of proceedings to tribunal. Clause 13 deals with  conciliation after the bringing of proceedings to tribunal. Clause 14 deals  with the recovery of sums payable under compromises involving the Labour  Relations Agency. Clause 15 provides for workers to have time off for study or  training. Clause 16 deals with the repeals made necessary by the Bill. Clause  17 deals with commencement. Clause 18 is the short title.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes that the repeal of the statutory  grievance procedures will result in savings of &pound;25,000 per annum to the Office  of Industrial Tribunals and the Fair Employment Tribunal as a result of the  reduced complexity of claims and pre-acceptance procedures. The Committee also  notes that the increased emphasis on pre-claim conciliation should generate  savings of about &pound;11,000 per annum for government, due to the resolution of  greater numbers of disputes without the need for tribunal hearings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Committee notes that the introduction of a  more straightforward procedure for the resolution of simple claims should save  government &pound;10,000 per annum in tribunal resources. The Committee is content  with those savings, as they are consistent with the moves to reform the wider  tribunal system. There may also be savings in staff morale and improvements in  how organisations function. There may be such qualitative outcomes that we do  not yet see but which will play a large part.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also notes that the right to request time to  train will cost government some &pound;6<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>7  million per annum in respect of tuition at levels 2 and 3, arising from  successful requests. The Committee highlights that that is a considerable cost,  and it hopes that the Department will be able to sustain it in the financially  straitened times to come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee accepts that the provisions in the Bill are  not deemed to have implications for human rights. With regard to the equality  impact assessment, the Committee accepts that the provisions in the Bill will  generally have modest positive benefits for all the groupings listed in section  75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. However, the Committee takes a positive  view of the Department&rsquo;s identification that some policy proposals will  generate greater benefits for particular groups. Such groups include single  parents who, due to family commitments and their less favourable economic  position, do not have the time or resources to become involved in lengthy or  complex legal processes; individuals with disabilities, particularly mental  health disabilities associated with or exacerbated by stress; racial, ethnic,  national or religious groups employed as migrant workers whose first language  is not English; and persons bringing a tribunal claim relating to their sexual  orientation or to political or religious discrimination. It is hoped that,  through the Bill, all those groups will benefit from enhanced information and  advice, access to a wider range of ADR services, and modifications to tribunal  processes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also positive about the benefits that some  groups will gain from the time to train provision, including dependants. That  right will allow individuals who care for a dependant greater flexibility to  arrange training at more suitable times. The provision will also benefit women,  who are more likely than men to take on the main responsibility for childcare  or to act as carers and who will, therefore, benefit disproportionately as  people with dependants. Lone parents are likely to benefit from a successful  request for time to train, given the particular difficulties that they are  likely to have in timetabling training outside working hours. The right will  also enhance opportunities for older people to retrain and update knowledge in  order to meet the challenges of changing working practices and skills  requirements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes the Minister&rsquo;s legislative competence  to make the Bill. Overall, the Committee is pleased with how the Bill deals  with issues that have been raised about workplace dispute resolution. Members  look forward to undertaking a thorough scrutiny of the Bill when it comes  before the Committee. On behalf of the Committee, I support the principles of  the Bill, which will now proceed to further scrutiny at Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will keep my remarks brief. I was ready to step into the breach, but the  Chairperson arrived, so Members will be spared the 11-page speech that I was  going to make.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill, and I also welcome what I understand to  have been a fairly productive working relationship with the Department in  arriving at this stage. I will not deal with the range of issues that the  Chairperson so thoroughly covered, but I will make some points.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards industrial tribunals, it appears that a sensible  approach has been taken towards achieving balance between the right of people  to pursue legal redress and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution.  That is certainly not premature in its inception. When I was training for the  Bar nearly 20 years ago, I remember the buzz about this new thing to come  called the alternative dispute resolution. It seems that, in certain regards,  we may have been a little slow in moving forward on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may be wrong for me to speculate, but it would seem  that, if many of the issues were in the hands of lawyers, further promotion of  alternative dispute resolution would be like turkeys voting for Christmas. I do  not know if I will be on some kind of lawyers&rsquo; hit list for supporting the  provisions. If we can promote a less formal, swifter and less costly resolution  to disputes in the workplace by way of ADR, particularly in the current  economic circumstances, everyone, with the possible exception of some lawyers,  would see that as a win-win situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is less about the exact structures or  regulations and more about promoting a culture of alternative dispute  resolution, which is equally as important as the information before us. The  widening of the role of the Labour Relations Agency in ADR is also to be  welcomed. It would also make sense to ensure that there is no duplication as  regards the Fair Employment Tribunal&rsquo;s ability to deal with aspects of cases  that, in other circumstances, would be dealt with through a separate industrial  tribunal.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I add one caveat or note of caution because I gather that  the Committee looked at and produced a report on workplace dispute resolution,  which the Minister has taken on board. We will want to consider the right to  request time to train in reasonable detail because it is a fresh suggestion. It  is important to get that right. Members of the Committee will understand the  rationale behind that and the reasons to promote it. However, we must exercise  a degree of caution. For example, there are estimates that the cost of granting  the right to train could run to several million pounds: &pound;6 million or &pound;7  million has been suggested. In our current financial situation, we must look at  whether that is the right way forward. The Federation of Small Businesses and  others have flagged up concerns about that issue. Therefore, we want to ensure  that whatever is put in place is practicable because we must bear in mind the  potential impact on our SMEs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Particularly in the current economic circumstances, we must  balance those concerns with the need and desire for people to be trained to a  better standard and higher level that they are at present. We must realise that  that will partly involve not simply the formal mechanisms of schemes such as  apprenticeships or qualifications, but how training can be introduced to people  who are already in employment. Therefore, the right to request time to train  has much merit; it is a question of ensuring that we get it right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I and other members of the Committee look forward to  progressing such issues. The Bill is very sensible. We will want to drill down  into the detail to make sure that it is got right. I welcome the Bill and  support its Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  on the Employment (No. 2) Bill. Like the Member who has just spoken, I do not  propose to go into as much detail as did the Minister or the Chairperson of the  Committee. I will just say that I look forward to the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. I  also look forward to the further involvement of stakeholders and interested  parties, which the Minister and Chairperson touched on. To date, there has been  a sensible working relationship between all with an interest in the Bill,  including the Committee, the Department, stakeholders and others. It is  important that we continue that sensible working relationship because we all  want to reach the same place, and there is no point in daily battles between  the Committee and the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members who spoke before me referred to last year&rsquo;s  Committee&rsquo;s report into workplace dispute resolution. Many of the issues that  were raised then are addressed in the Bill, which highlights the importance of  the Committee and its relationship with stakeholders and others in the  community who want to be involved in such matters. We were able to raise those  issues with the Department, which, in its turn, did the same with the Minister,  who, in fairness, always said that his approach would be open minded. As a  result, we are not criticising each other about the Bill: everybody is  addressing it wisely and correctly because we all want to see it achieve the  outcomes that we want. That shows the positive side of working with the  Committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to take the opportunity to thank our Committee  staff for their hard work, advice and guidance on the Bill. I particularly want  to mention the departmental officials who were available when we needed any  information. Based on evidence that we heard, on which the Minister has  touched, a method of early dispute resolution must be developed. As the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee said, that process must come before lawyers get  involved, which can add to and cause problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I also agree that we need to look at ways of  extending the role of the Labour Relations Agency. A key issue of concern  raised last year was that the advice issued by the Labour Relations Agency  sometimes differs depending on the case and who made contact. We cannot go into  specific details on that, but we need to make sure that, from the outset, employers  and employees have access to the relevant, up-to-date information. Bad  information will entrench people when it comes to resolving issues. The Labour  Relations Agency does and will continue to do good work, but it is important  that we ensure that as much information as possible is available because, from  both their points of view, information is key to the rights of employers and  employees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and the Chairperson went into detail about the  Bill, which contains 18 clauses and three schedules, and it is important to  have that detail on record. I look forward to teasing out some of the issues in  Committee. Concerns, including a genuine one that the Federation of Small  Businesses raised about time to train, need to be drawn out. Our people are a key  factor in coming out of the recession; if they are being made redundant as a  result of the economic downturn, in order to get jobs in other sectors, we must  ensure that they are reskilled and upskilled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A sizeable percentage of industry here consists of small  and medium-sized enterprises. We spend &pound;6&middot;2 million to retrain people, but that  does not take account of those who used to have small businesses. As part of  the big picture, we must work collectively to produce a resolution that takes  on board the concerns of the Federation of Small Businesses. A piece of that  jigsaw may emerge as a result the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Bill coming before the Committee, and  I look forward to the good working relationship between the Department, the  Minister and the Committee continuing. Perhaps because we have dealt with the  matter through an alternative dispute resolution process, other Departments  might take those methods on board and engage in mediation with their respective  Committees. I commend the Minister for approaching the matter with an open  mind. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I commend the Minister for bringing forward this important piece of legislation.  The first two of the four parts represent a common-sense revision of existing  legislation, and the Bill is an acceptance that several statutory provisions  that have been made in the area of employment in the past 15 years or so have  not had the intended consequences. The Minister is to be congratulated on such  a frank review of the legislation, and the Bill will make the statutory dispute  resolution process much more fit for purpose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 1 to 4 focus on repealing statutory dispute  resolution provisions. In 2005, direct rule Ministers implemented legally  enforceable guidelines on dispute resolution, whereby if employers and  employees fail to meet minimum standards, the tribunal can increase or decrease  awards that might be made. Such provisions lead inevitably to a box-ticking  approach to compliance and dispute resolution rather than to genuine efforts to  resolve the issues at hand. Furthermore, it is not proper for the state to  become so intimately involved in the minute detail of such matters. As other  Members suggested, a one-size-fits-all approach will not deal with every issue.  Since workplace disputes have varying degrees of severity, statutory guidelines  would have to be so flexible as to be unenforceable and pointless. Therefore, I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to repeal those provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 relates to the operation of industrial tribunals and  to the duties of the Labour Relations Agency. Clause 5 creates a new,  fast-track approach to some minor cases that come before a tribunal, in which  the facts are not in dispute and to which both parties agree in writing. That  is a very sensible approach, making such cases less expensive for the state,  employers and employees alike. That is to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also drops the provision that limits tribunals to  granting anonymity in cases that involve sexual misconduct. Assuming that that  wider power is used responsibly, by further removing any perceived impediments  to making complaints and by protecting employers from spurious complaints with  malicious intent, it can only increase confidence in the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third part of the Bill relates to the powers of the  fair employment tribunal. Currently, the tribunal has limited powers to hear  complaints: one complaint may have several aspects to it, but the tribunal  cannot hear aspects that relate to, for example, unpaid wages. Clearly, it is  costly to have two concurrent legal cases running on what is basically the same  case, and it is an unnecessary division of powers. It is right that the Bill  should empower the president or vice president of the tribunal to decide that a  single case should have its entire body adjudicated on by the tribunal, rather  than be artificially split into component parts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 and clause 13 repeal aspects of previous  legislation that have not had the intended consequences. They transform a duty  of the Labour Relations Agency into a power to conciliate so that the agency  can better manage and prioritise its resources. Clause 13 removes the provision  for the conciliation process to be time limited. That is welcome, as some cases  will not fit into a box that is created by legislation and require more time to  be processed. The amendment in clause 12 will protect the agency&rsquo;s resources from  never-ending processes that it cannot escape from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final part of the Bill creates a new right to time off  for study and training. It is important that that right be placed on the  statute book. All good employers will already have in place established  practices to deal with continuing professional development. All businesses, as  other Members have mentioned, benefit from training, and we all want to see  much more of it. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments in that regard. I understand  that it is to be phased in so that SMEs can prepare properly for its  introduction and judge when the economic conditions are right in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I support the Bill. Although I am not a  member of the Committee for Employment and Learning, I will certainly tell the  Committees of which I am a member about the encouraging working relationship  between the Minister and his Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the principles of the Bill. As the former head of a voluntary  organisation for 10 years with responsibility for HR, and as a founding  commissioner of the Equality Commission, I have experiences of dealing with  workplace disputes. They can be lengthy, bureaucratic and stressful for all  those involved. Therefore, I welcome the Bill, which seeks to introduce a less  legalistic approach to dealing with workplace grievances by repealing the  three-step grievance procedure. That will make it easier for employers and  employees to raise and deal with grievances by using non-legislative processes  to ensure that attempts are made to effectively address disputes as early as  possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also seeks to simplify and provide consistency to  the time limits for industrial tribunals and fair employment tribunals which take  place in relation to dismissal and disciplinary situations. Removing the  confusion around the current processes for extending time limits in those  hearings will ensure that the process overall is easier to access and  understand for all parties involved. Furthermore, I welcome the additional  powers for industrial tribunals to reach a decision without necessitating a  hearing if all parties agree in writing. That introduces a simple, timely and  cost-effective way of dealing with and resolving simple disputes without having  to resort to a full hearing or case.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Modification of the powers of tribunals to reduce publicity  is of obvious benefit to those who are deterred from going to tribunals due to  the potential disclosure of sensitive information. That benefits claimants and  all parties involved that may be affected by such disclosures.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that many people may be  discouraged from raising a grievance because the issue may be sensitive; for  example, racial or sexual harassment. I welcome the fact that the Bill seeks to  overcome that problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also sets out plans to ensure that awards made  through conciliated settlements or tribunals are enforceable, as though they  were a court order, thereby ensuring that those who are granted an award are  not forced to go to court to ensure that they receive it, which, again, will  save time, effort and the additional cost of going to court to retrieve an  award or settlement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Granting additional powers to fair employment tribunals by  allowing them to hear aspects of cases that would previously have necessitated  a separate industrial tribunal will, again, save time, effort and cost and  simplify the process for all involved. That should be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the freedom that the Bill proposes to give to the  Labour Relations Agency in that the agency may or may not participate in  pretrial conciliation without having to justify the reasons for becoming or not  becoming involved. That freedom will allow the Labour Relations Agency to  prioritise cases when its resources are overstretched; and its resources are  often overstretched. It also allows the agency to save resources by not  participating in cases where it is clear that conciliation will not be  successful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the introduction of a legislative framework for  an employee to have the right to request time to train, with the proviso that  the time must be used for study or training to improve an employee&rsquo;s  effectiveness at work and be of benefit to the performance of the employer&rsquo;s  business. Safeguards are built into the Bill to ensure that businesses are not  adversely affected by granting time off for training or study. It is a good  step towards ensuring that Northern    Ireland has an effective, successful and  highly skilled workforce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has said that many organisations provide  training for their staff as a matter of course. When I was director of the  organisation that I referred to earlier, it always had a work plan for staff  development at any staff appraisal, which included the type of course that  staff would attend and the costs involved. It is a good incentive for staff  self-development and staff retention. If staff are valued, trained and  upskilled, they will be a great asset to the organisation and will stay with  it. However, at this time of economic recovery, we must be mindful of placing  the burden of extra legislation and administration on businesses, as we were  warned by the Federation of Small Businesses.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage. Owing to the  time allocated, I will be brief.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is welcome that the Committee for Employment and  Learning has been a positive driver of the Bill. It has been fully involved and  will continue to be fully involved in the process. The Committee got the  message loud and clear from local businesses that the workplace dispute  resolution requirements needed to be reviewed and altered, not simply as a  mirror image of changes in other parts of the UK but as a bespoke set of  arrangements specific to Northern Ireland and based on wide-ranging  consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Employment law is viewed widely by those in all sectors of  business as complicated, difficult to interpret and expensive to implement when  required. That has, in turn, led to many businesses being placed in difficult situations  that have been expensive to resolve and harmful to workplace relations. We want  to arrive at a situation where employers feel confident in managing their  employees and handling workplace disputes. As a Committee member, I believe  that we are moving in the right direction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is much more that I could say but, conscious of time,  I will conclude by offering my support to the Bill at Second Stage. There is no  doubt that, when the Bill reaches Committee, Members will welcome the  opportunity to comb through the detail to improve and enhance the situation for  local employers and employees. Our devolved Administration sometimes unduly  gets a hard press. However, it is good to see that the Assembly is getting to  grips with the real issues and that it will provide resolution to concerns and  issues that are specific to Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the fact that employment  law is being addressed by the Assembly. When giving evidence to the Committee,  a departmental official said something that underpins the difficulties when  there is a grievance and when a working relationship in an organisation breaks  down. The previous Member to speak referred to the complexities and  difficulties experienced by employers and employees. That departmental official  said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There must be a cultural change in the way that  employment relations are arranged in Northern Ireland; that is, the way  that employees raise their grievances and how employers deal with those.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That neatly encapsulates what this Bill, when it is  enacted, should put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is employment law, but it is accepted that it does  not work. The current processes for workplace dispute resolution have been in  place since 2005, but it was accepted that there were difficulties with those  processes, and the Gibbons report formalised that acceptance. Aside from that  formal recognition, we, as elected Members, have had examples of difficulties  brought to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee and others referred to the  public sector, which has a vital role to play as an employer and in acting for  those whom it employs. I have had some dealings with the Labour Relations  Agency, and the little experience that I have in this area indicates that it  can be difficult for employees to bring grievances in some circumstances. There  are problems with how some grievances are dealt with. There are questions about  whether the employee knows about the Labour Relations Agency, what role it  plays, how it can be contacted and whether the employee will get the  information that he or she needs. It is important that the information that the  employee receives is relevant to the difficulties that the employee may have.  Therefore, I agree with the Chairperson&rsquo;s view that the public sector must be a  role model in these matters and has a part to play in establishing relevant  legislation. Indeed, putting in place legislation is key.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been no shortage of consultation on the issue.  The Committee produced a report on workplace dispute resolution which included  evidence taken from key stakeholders and organisations. However, the issue  still comes down to what occurs when there is a dispute between an employer and  an employee. Therefore, given the complexities, difficulties, stresses and anxieties  that both sides experience during a dispute, it is vital that legislation makes  the process of resolution easier and more meaningful for all involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support the Bill, and I repeat that, as with all  such matters, the detail of the legislation and, specifically, how it will  eventually be implemented are crucial. I join other Members in commending the  Minister and his Department on the extensive nature of the consultation.  Perhaps that highlights the fact that we routinely go out to consultation and  produce documents. The key point is that, in the final analysis, the  implementation of the Bill will be important.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Members who contributed to the debate,  and I will try to deal with some of their remarks. The Bill seeks to deliver  substantively on all of the core principles that I outlined, which are the  product of a positive engagement with stakeholders, to which a number of  Members referred. As I said in my opening remarks, the policy review also  identified non-legislative measures that focus specifically on wider employment  relations practice: the agreement of a code of practice for all information  providers; training for managers in employment relations; the establishment of  good practice models for employment relations; and so forth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issues raised by the Committee for Employment  and Learning and by individual Members during the debate. I thank the  Chairperson for her positive and supportive comments on the way in which the  Department took forward the policy review and on the policy intent behind the  Bill. The policy review demonstrated what can be achieved through joint  working, and I assure the House that my Department will continue to support the  Committee as it scrutinises the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Committee identified the need to  embed a culture in which the early resolution of workplace disputes should be  the norm, while ensuring that citizens&rsquo; access to the justice system is  preserved. The need for a cultural shift away from formal legal mechanisms was  echoed by the vast majority of stakeholders during the public consultation, and  I am pleased that a number of Members, including the Deputy Chairman, Mrs  McGill and others mentioned that. I shall spend a moment on the cultural shift  required, because the ultimate aim behind the Bill is to resolve disputes. If  they can be resolved informally, that is infinitely better than people having  to go through an expensive and time-consuming form of litigation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir feared that his legal colleagues would take umbrage  at his not supporting them. We all need the law, and it is essential that we  have access to it, not only for the resolution of disputes but in other areas  of activity. However, in that particular area of life and business, the process  has become more important than the outcome. When people are overly focused on  maintaining a process-driven approach to disputes, they spend less energy on  the cause of the dispute. In addition, small businesses, which make up the vast  majority of businesses in Northern    Ireland, do not have dedicated HR  professionals. It is easy for people who are not up to speed on all the details  to make an error in process or procedure and thereby prejudice their case,  irrespective of the rights or wrongs of the issue.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I endorse the Committee&rsquo;s comments that it is important for  employees and employers to have access to information on their rights and  responsibilities, and I am pleased that the Committee has drawn attention to  the challenges that SMEs face when trying to meet their employer responsibilities.  However, that goes beyond the Bill&rsquo;s provision, which, helpfully, allows me to  refer to some of the non-legislative proposals that my Department and key  stakeholders will take forward in partnership to improve information provision.  We intend to establish an interagency information forum to develop a coherent  and consistent approach to providing information on employment rights. In  partnership with other government and non-government partners, we will look at  mechanisms for improving the support available to SMEs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members commented on the Federation of Small  Businesses. I know that that organisation has been briefing and lobbying  Members. A survey that the FSB conducted some time ago highlighted the issues  that its members found most challenging. For example, 75% found it difficult to  keep up with changes, and 84&middot;6% struggled with the number of different  regulations and requirements. Furthermore, 73% experienced uncertainty over  whether they had got it right, and almost 60% had difficulty understanding what  is required of them. It is clear from those figures that there is a widespread  view among small businesses that dispute resolution procedures are over their  head and that they find them difficult and complicated. Therefore, we hope that  the provision of information will inform and help, thereby underpinning and  leading to the resolution of disputes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee called on the public sector to be a leader in  the development of good employment relations. My Department recently established  an employment relations pilot in partnership with the trade unions, and I  intend to promote across the public sector any good practice that emerges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also indicated that it has not had the  opportunity to examine the provisions that deal with the right to request time  to train but it is generally supportive of an initiative that will enhance Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  skill base. As I said in my opening address, those provisions are designed to  achieve the enabling powers that will allow for the subsequent introduction of  that new right. The FSB has lobbied Members on the matter and has set out  clearly what it believes to be one of the key areas. Its document &lsquo;Regulatory  Reform &ndash; a route to economic recovery&rsquo; states, and I quote:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To boost the chances of job creation during the  period of economic recovery, all new business regulation should be halted for  the period of recession and first 18 months of economic recovery&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I will not put specific times on it, but I ask the  Assembly to provide for the enabling power, after which we can introduce  processes if we want to introduce the right to train.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that, through the GB proposals, employers will  still have the right to refuse in designated circumstances. However, we do not  want to get into a situation in which there are disputes about that. We feel  that, in the current economic circumstances, it is essential not to proceed  with implementation now. However, it is wise to take the power to do so, in  order that we can trigger it at a later stage. We all want people to be  trained. That is one of the driving forces behind what we have all been trying  to do over the past number of years. Equally, where there is a right to do it,  that could even be a source of dispute itself. Therefore, having listened to  people&rsquo;s views, we feel that, on balance, now is not the most opportune moment  to introduce the power. A cost is attached, and the Department reckons that, if  enough people take the training, that cost will be around &pound;6&middot;7 million a year.  Any costs that add to our difficult financial circumstances are best avoided at  this stage. If we were debating this issue this time tomorrow, we might have  some sense of what that might be, but I believe that we should leave the matter  in abeyance at the moment, pass the enabling power and leave it for subsequent  implementation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey asked about stakeholders. As a former  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning, she focused on a  range of the Committee&rsquo;s work. I will seek to reconstitute the steering group  as an implementation group. In addition, the Department will continue to seek  the expert involvement of stakeholders on a range of implementation projects  that emerge from the review, and we must not forget that we wish to introduce  some non-legislative changes. If the stakeholder group agrees, its views will  be transferred into implementation mode so that we can, I hope, roll the  process out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, every attempt to improve that area of our  economic life has been well intentioned, but, over time, lawyers got at it and  turned it into a more confrontational and judicially based approach. ACAS in Great Britain,  for example, includes the word &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo; in the title, and the LRA, which  is our nearest equivalent, has the words &ldquo;labour relations&rdquo; in its title. In  other words, the thrust is to improve relationships, but, over time, we got  ourselves into trench warfare. Many of the cases are protracted, distract  management and employees from the rest of their work and are extremely expensive  and debilitating. In some cases, vexatious claimants managed to take a series  of companies to court over various issues. Therefore, we tried to get the  balance right between the ultimate right of a citizen to have access to a legal  process, if and when an employee feels that he or she has been badly treated,  and the need to be practical and reach solutions. We felt that the introduction  of formal grievance processes at a very early stage militated against  conciliation. Altering the position of the Labour Relations Agency, making it  more open to undertake other matters and removing some arbitrary time limits on  process would allow it to be active to the end of a dispute. The agency would  be involved as far as tribunal stage, because, as Members will be aware,  disputes in all walks of life, particularly legal disputes, are often settled  on the steps of the court. Unfortunately, the Labour Relations Agency was being  closed out at a much earlier stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who contributed to the debate. Today  represents an important milestone in the development of employment relations in  Northern Ireland.  Throughout the review, employers and employer representative bodies expressed  concern about the existing dispute resolution systems. They have consistently  argued for changes that will reduce the financial and opportunity costs  associated with disputes that escalate beyond the workplace. Employee  representative groups also argued for improve&shy;ments that provide less formal  alternatives to the tribunal system while preserving citizens&rsquo; fundamental  right to access to the justice system. Therefore, I hope that we achieved that  balance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will want to scrutinise the Bill and, as they  say, drill down. The word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; has been much used. The Bill will lead to a  change in culture, but we must ensure that the implementation of those changes  is driven through in a way that reinforces that and that people begin to see  the benefits of it. I hope that that, combined with the reduced financial burden,  will be a positive development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also take this opportunity to thank departmental officials  for their consistent efforts. I know that they have put a lot of work into  this. I have already told the Committee Chairperson that the officials will be  available to help the Committee at any time during the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members who wish to ask supplementary questions that they  must be rising or on their feet to be called.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Maze/Long Kesh Site</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister for an update on  the development of the Maze/Long Kesh site. &nbsp;(AQO 1439/10<a name="AQO1439/10" id="AQO1439/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: On 8 April 2009, the deputy First Minister and I  announced that a development corporation would be established to take forward  the regeneration of the former prison and Army base at Maze/Long Kesh. A draft  statutory rule has been prepared to create the Maze/Long Kesh development  corporation, and we hope to schedule the Assembly debate on that issue before  the summer recess. In parallel, the Maze/Long Kesh programme delivery unit  continues to prepare the site for potential future development. Maze/Long Kesh  presents us with a unique and viable redevelopment opportunity. In the current  economic climate, opportunities of that type are rare, and it is important that  we exploit that potential to the full.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raith maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the First Minister believe  that we have a story to tell about our own conflict transformation process that  can strike a positive note on the international stage and bring investment in  from all over the world?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The site presents a number of opportunities. The Royal Ulster  Agricultural Society (RUAS) has expressed some interest, and discussions are  taking place with that organisation. There is an opportunity for economic  investment on the site, and I believe that the European Union can be persuaded  to help fund a conflict resolution centre, whatever it may finally be called.  The retained buildings can be incorporated into the overall site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has a significant and historic  conflict resolution story to tell to the world. I do not take the view that any  two problem situations across the world are identical, but people can learn  from our experience, as did we from others. However, it is important that that  story is told in a balanced way. The deputy First Minister and I agree that the  site should not become a shrine, in any form, to any paramilitary organisation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: In  the First Minister&rsquo;s original response, he said that he hoped to table a motion  in the Assembly dealing with the creation of a development corporation. Were  the Assembly to give its consent to that motion before the summer recess, when  could that corporation be established?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Whether the Assembly gives its approval before or after the  summer recess, the corporation will be established six months after the  Assembly&rsquo;s support is given.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the First Minister tell us when he will instruct officials in the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) to prepare a business  case for the conflict transformation centre? Where will it be located?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Those issues are being examined, and propositions have been  considered by the Department. As I said in my earlier answer, I believe that,  were we to submit an application in relation to the site, the European Union  would support it and would make a significant contribution. The project is in  the final stages of consideration, but it must be brought about in a way that  can gain the support of the whole community and become something that  encourages bonding in society rather than being divisive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the RUAS.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the First Minister agree that, if agreement can be  reached with the RUAS to move items to the Maze site, that that can go ahead  and not be held back while waiting on everything to be agreed, and that we can  see some progress on the site after so many years of delay?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Since all those matters will be subject to the approval of the Executive,  I can only speak for myself. We are keen that if agreement can be reached with  the RUAS, it will move ahead; however, I think that others in the Executive  would be keen to see the overall shape of the site before giving approval to  any one part of it.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Racial Equality Panel</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr A  Maginness </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what progress  has been made in the establishment of the racial equality panel and its  subgroups and to outline the panel&rsquo;s terms of reference. (AQO 1440/10<a name="AQO1440/10" id="AQO1440/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will ask junior Minister  Robin Newton to answer that question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr Newton)</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question, which is important, given the economic  climate; it may become even more important in future. To better focus the  business of the Racial Equality Forum, members were asked to self-nominate to  join the racial equality panel. The panel is being established to drive the work  of the forum. By the deadline, we had received and accepted nine nominations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those appointed represent the views of the wider minority  ethnic sector. The panel will also include representatives from relevant  Departments, faith-based organisations and the Equality Commission, among  others. Apart from forum meetings, it is planned for the panel to meet twice a  year. Consequently, panel members are required to consult widely with the  minority ethnic sector and to advise it on panel proceedings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The forum&rsquo;s subgroup on immigration has met twice and is  making significant progress on recommendations on those who find themselves  destitute through no fault of their own. A first meeting of the panel is  planned for late July when the terms of reference will be given careful,  detailed and active consideration. There will also be discussion of  establishing additional subgroups, although those subgroups have resource  implications that need to be taken into consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the junior Minister for his comprehensive answer; progress is certainly  being made. It is important in the economic downturn that the rights of racial  minorities be fully protected, and the panel is one way of doing that. Will the  junior Minister assure the House that he will continue that valuable work in  order to protect ethnic minorities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The junior Minister (Mr Newton)</span>:  Yes. The point is well made by the Member. Racial equality is a highly emotive  issue that has received considerable press coverage. We are aware of a young lady  in Coleraine who lost her legs as a result of becoming homeless and destitute;  that is a matter of concern. The Member will know that we are working within a UK framework on  the issue, and it is something that we will continue to work on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the junior Minister outline what funding provision is available for  support and help in ethnic minority communities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The junior Minister (Mr Newton)</span>:  The point that I have already made is tied closely to the point made by the  Member because if people find themselves in difficulty, we expect the ethnic  minority organisations to provide them with support. No one, whatever their  racial background, should feel that they cannot approach an organisation in Northern Ireland  for support. OFMDFM is fully committed to building a cohesive, shared and  integrated society. Those words will trip off the tongue very easily in the  next number of months as we develop the strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The OFMDFM minority ethnic development fund provides vital  support to those groups, enabling them to build up capacity and providing the  practical support and advice needed in our communities. The fund will be worth  &pound;1&middot;1 million in 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a part of the 2010-11 minority ethnic funding scheme,  more than &pound;949,000 of development funding has been allocated to 22  organisations and &pound;160,296 of project funding has been awarded to 12  organisations. We expect all those organisations to provide the necessary  support to various ethnic minority groups.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. Given that migrant workers and their families have  made a vital contribution to our society and economy and that many of them do  not have recourse to public funding, what measures and steps is the Department  taking to assist them at this time? I am conscious of what the Minister said  about the funding that is available for groups and organisations. However, I am  referring particularly to those workers and families who are no longer in work  here.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. We are seeing a  pattern emerge, because the issues that those questions raise are interwoven.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of our difficulties is that immigration is not a  devolved matter; responsibility for policy issues remains with the Westminster  Government. Although we are sometimes constrained by UK-wide legislation, we  are determined to examine what support we can give to people facing genuine  crises. The Executive&rsquo;s primary focus is on economic growth to build a better  future for all people here, including new arrivals. We expect the groups funded  by OFMDFM to provide practical help and support to those people who fall on  economic hardship and who are suffering. I have no reason to doubt that we will  continue to fund those groups during the course of the year. The budgets are already  set, and I do not anticipate any interference with them.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Devolution</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what discussions  they have had with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State regarding the  devolution of further powers to Northern    Ireland. (AQO 1441/10<a name="AQO1441/10" id="AQO1441/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member will be aware that the devolution of policing and  justice powers to this Administration took place on 12 April, and we proposed  that responsibility for, and the power to legislate on, all matters relating to  public assembly in Northern Ireland will also be transferred on a date to be  determined. As far as the devolution of any further powers is concerned, the  deputy First Minister and I met the Prime Minister, David Cameron, on 20 May  and the Secretary of State, Owen Paterson, on 14 May to share our views on the  key priorities for the years ahead. We also met the Prime Minister at the Joint  Ministerial Committee plenary meeting on 8 June.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the possibility of differential  rates of corporation tax across the United Kingdom was raised with us  in those discussions. The UK  Government intend to consider how the transfer of corporation tax-varying  powers to Northern Ireland  might be achieved. However, at this early stage, all the implications of such a  step remain to be thoroughly explored. The issue of devolving any other  reserved powers to this Administration will be kept under review.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the First Minister for his reply. On the eve of what is likely  to be a very important and crucial Budget announcement by the Chancellor, not  only in national terms but in Northern Ireland  terms, does the First Minister agree that it is vital that we grow our private  sector given that public spending looks set to be tightened across the UK? Will he  tell the House what level of agreement exists in the Northern Ireland Executive  and what discussions they have had about the possible devolution of corporation  tax-varying powers?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The First Minister</span>: I agree  entirely with the Member that we are likely to face some fairly stringent cuts  in public expenditure. One of the Executive&rsquo;s priorities will be to ensure that  the cuts protect, in as far as they can, public services, particularly front  line services, and the economic growth that, I believe, Northern Ireland can  substantially enjoy. We need to look at ways of getting greater growth into the  economy. Obviously, the Northern Ireland Administration would be in a strong position  if it had a fiscal lever to reduce corporation tax.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the coalition Government have not yet brought forward  that paper, we are not in a position to consider either it or its possible  implications at Executive level. If its implications are that public  expenditure will be cut elsewhere to reduce the block grant to an equivalent  amount, one set of considerations would have to be put in place. However, if  the paper permits us to look at the reduction of corporation tax for various  sectors, rather than for the whole of our economy, a different set of  considerations would come into play. Until we get the full detail of the paper  from the Government, we cannot have that discussion.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Stephen Bell for a supplementary question. I am sorry;  Mr Jonathan Bell.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: On  a weekend of success for Northern Ireland,  with Graeme McDowell&rsquo;s historic US Open win, what is the First Minister&rsquo;s  assessment of how successful it would be for Northern Ireland to be able, as has  been said, to set its own rate of corporation tax? Will the First Minister  continue to impress that on the UK Government and find out when they will be  able to make a further announcement on the matter?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I congratulate the Member for his ingenuity in getting in a  question that refers to the triumph of a Northern Ireland golfer. From  Thursday right through to Monday morning, I think I watched almost every shot  that Graeme McDowell played. His win was a tremendous achievement and good news  for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland would benefit substantially from a  reduction in corporation tax. We have a very good product at our disposal, even  under present circumstances. However, investors, particularly those who are  involved in foreign direct investment, often look at the bottom line, and, very  often, they look at the trendy aspect, which is the rate of corporation tax.  Therefore, a reduction would help us considerably.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike other parts of the United Kingdom, this part has a  land frontier with a European partner that has a substantially lower rate of  corporation tax. Therefore, it is very important that we deal with the matter  in a way that allows us to compete on the island with a country that has one of  the lowest available corporation tax rates in the European Community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Dr Stephen &mdash; not Jonathan &mdash; Farry for a supplementary  question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Dr Farry</span>: It is a pleasure  to be morphed with Jonathan Bell. I cannot think of a finer person for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the First Minister think that, ahead of the autumn  investment conference in Washington,  there would be a strong advantage in the British Government giving at least a  positive indication on corporation tax? That could be seen in the context of  American companies facing the prospect of taxation on foreign profits.  Therefore, a lower rate of corporation tax may be a very good way of  contravening that trend.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The First Minister</span>: It  would certainly be helpful if a lower rate were available for that period of  time. However, I raised the issue with the Prime Minister, who indicated that  it was more likely that we would receive the paper, rather than its outcome, by  the time of the conference. We need to be careful that we do not raise  expectations on this issue to too high a level. The deputy First Minister and I  attended a meeting with a Treasury Minister, and his view was slightly less  helpful than that of the Northern    Ireland Secretary of State. Therefore,  different views will come forward from the Treasury. However, we know that the  Treasury frowned on this matter the previous occasion that it was considered.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Budget Cuts</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what steps  they are taking to protect public services and to grow the economy in light of  anticipated Budget cuts. (AQO 1442/10<a name="AQO1442/10" id="AQO1442/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister and I continue to liaise with the Prime  Minister, David Cameron, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  on the likely impact of Budget cuts here. We are well aware of the financial  challenges that lie ahead for everyone. The size of our block grant is a key  issue and of fundamental importance to our ability to continue to deliver  public services and support to local businesses and people. Last month, the  funding available for local public services was cut by &pound;127 million per annum,  which was the Executive&rsquo;s share of the &pound;6 billion reduction in UK public  expenditure in 2010-11. In addition, there are expected to be further real-term  reductions in funding over the four-year period from 2011-12 until 2014-15, as  part of the 2010 spending review, which will take place in the autumn. Further  details on that are expected in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s emergency  Budget statement tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The result of that reduction in funding from the Treasury  is that local Departments will need to make savings in the coming years to  address cost pressures and fund improvements in public services. Although those  savings should come from reductions in bureaucracy and administration costs in  the first instance, front line services will also need to become more  efficient. However, the scale of the challenge means that a fundamental  assessment of the services provided by the Executive and the best form of  delivery will also be required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have taken a number of important steps to  support the local economy during the recession and in its immediate aftermath.  For example, to support the labour market at this critical time, the Department  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment helped to safeguard over 2,200 jobs between  April 2009 and March 2010. Furthermore, over the same period, Invest Northern Ireland also  assisted in the promotion of over 4,300 jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive also recently established a subcommittee  chaired by Minister Foster to prioritise and co-ordinate action on the economy.  The subcommittee is currently working to develop an economic strategy for Northern Ireland  that will set our priorities, actions and targets for the short, medium and  longer term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the best approach for the Executive is to support  companies as they seek to improve their competitiveness in the global market  place so that there is less reliance on public sector spending in the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for that very detailed and helpful answer. There was  so much detail in it that I look forward to seeing the Official Report to take  in all of the information that he imparted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the First Minister&rsquo;s remarks, can I take it that he is  firmly of the view that further savings can be identified without impacting on  public services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Yes, of course. Identifying areas in which public savings can be  made is one issue, and I have no doubt that there are further savings that can  be made. Ask any member of the public, and he or she will be able to identify  areas where the Government should be cutting back and where there is waste.  However, we need to get agreement in the Executive on areas to make savings.  Therefore, a consensus is required, which can sometimes be difficult.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Campbell</span>: Will the First  Minister give an assurance that when there are inward investment conferences  and investors looking at Northern Ireland, particularly when there is a  dependence in the economy on tourism, excellent golf courses, such as the one  that produced our US Open winner, Graeme McDowell, will be promoted actively to  ensure that visitors come here in their tens of thousands?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The First Minister</span>:  Ingenuity knows no bounds, Mr Deputy Speaker. You would be the last one to call  any Member to order on this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has tremendous golf courses, and the  Tourist Board are well aware of that. Within the past few days, the deputy  First Minister and I met a delegation of Americans who had enjoyed the use of  those golf courses. I met a group of American trial lawyers who were in Northern Ireland,  almost on a tour of the golf courses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For the first time in 40 years, a European has won the US  Open, and the fact that he is from Northern   Ireland will draw attention to the talent that we have  and to the assets in Northern    Ireland that have formed that talent.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Although I recognise that the Executive have placed a priority on growing the  economy, does the First Minister agree that developing the green economy must  be a priority now? For example, Harland and Wolff has taken advantage and  developed wind turbines.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Harland and Wolff has been instrumental in manufacturing the  tidal version as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a tremendous opportunity to develop the green  economy, and it is something that the Enterprise Minister is very much in  favour of pushing forward. Again, when we were in the United States, the deputy First Minister and I  met one of the companies that are very keen to be involved with wind turbines  in Northern Ireland,  so developing that is clearly beneficial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we need to recognise that the best way to get  economic growth is through businesses that bring export potential. Ultimately,  we have to encourage those businesses, not only by encouraging foreign direct  investment but also by looking at our own indigenous businesses to see how they  can be expanded and can grow and where they can export their products.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Joint Ministerial Committee</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McQuillan </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister for an update  on the recent Joint Ministerial Committee meeting. &nbsp;(AQO 1443/10<a name="AQO1443/10" id="AQO1443/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister and I attended a meeting of the Joint  Ministerial Committee in London  on 8 June 2010. The meeting, which was chaired by the Prime Minister, was the  first since the formation of the new Government and was an early opportunity  for the devolved Administrations to reinforce the importance of the institution  of the Joint Ministerial Committee and to seek the commitment of the UK  Government to participation at the highest levels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agenda consisted of three items: the Government&rsquo;s  programme, the economy and finance, and intergovernmental relations. The  meeting also discussed the Respect agenda and how the four Administrations  could work together to make that a reality. The greater part of the discussion  was devoted to the economy. We stressed to the Prime Minister the differential  structures of our respective economies and the implications of any sudden and  drastic reduction in public expenditure for our local economy, which is still  emerging from recession.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was unanimity among the devolved Administrations in  impressing upon the Prime Minister the need for a fresh approach to  negotiations between the Treasury and the devolved Administrations on all  issues of public finance, including the need for greater flexibilities and the  need to ensure that our shared commitment to protecting the economy is governed  by the principles of responsible management of the public finances. We explored  and identified areas of shared interest in encouraging sustainable economic  growth and achieving the best value provision of public services along with  maintaining and improving competitiveness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Prime Minister assured us of his commitment to  effective and meaningful inter-Administration relationships and to improving  the processes supporting those relationships, particularly those relating to  finance. We agreed to continue and to maintain a regular dialogue on all those  matters, and a programme of meetings under the auspices of the Joint  Ministerial Committee (JMC) was agreed for the year ahead. The Member may wish  to note that a copy of the agreed joint communiqu&eacute; has been placed in the  Assembly Library.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for a detailed answer. Does the First Minister agree  that the fact that the JMC meeting was chaired by the Prime Minister and  attended by the Deputy Prime Minister will prove to be evidence of an enhanced  role for the devolved Administrations in national Government?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: On that day, we had a meeting of the JMC and of the JMCE, which  is the Joint Ministerial Committee in European format. We probably met about  two thirds of the Cabinet at those two meetings. That indicates that they put a  very high priority on the issue. The real test, of course, is not so much about  their presence; it is not even so much the fact that that was the first time  such a meeting was held in Downing Street. It  will be important that we see some product from those meetings, and we look  forward to seeing whether the suggestions put forward by the devolved Administrations  are shaped into policy decisions by the new Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Dallat</span>: Will the  Minister give us some indication of the joint initiatives that he and the  deputy First Minister intend to bring forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I assume that we are talking about the previous question, which  was about the JMC. The deputy First Minister and I put proposals to the  Government in relation to getting greater flexibility in our finances,  particularly over the period of the next comprehensive spending review. It is  important, in our view, that we have automatic access to the end-year  flexibility. In our case, that is about a quarter of a billion pounds, which  would assist us with the cuts that are coming. We also asked for greater  flexibility in moving money from capital into resource. There are also issues  arising from the statement on finance policy that was brought forward by the  Labour Administration, which, I hope, the new Administration will change and on  which all the devolved Administrations would seek to have improvements.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue that the deputy First Minister and I are  agreed on and have argued strongly for is that there should be a system of  arbitration where there are disputes. For instance, the Treasury decided that  although there was urban regeneration funding for the Olympics, we would not  get the Barnett consequentials for it. Those would have meant additional tens  of millions of pounds for Northern    Ireland, which, in urban regeneration terms,  would have been significant for DSD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone in the devolved Administrations agrees that there  was a strong, indeed unanswerable, case that we should have received that  funding. When the cuts came along, the Treasury decided that that was an area  in which the Olympics should be pared back. It applied negative Barnett  consequentials to us, having not given us the positive consequentials in the  first place. When that was pointed out, rather than giving us the positive  consequentials, the Treasury took away the &pound;1 million or &pound;2 million of negative  consequentials.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="12"></a>Regional Development</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I advise Members that question 3 has been withdrawn. I further  remind Members who wish to ask a supplementary question that they must be  rising or on their feet to be called.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">A5 and A8 Road Schemes</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Dr  McDonnell </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail the total  amount spent to date on contractors and consultants for the A5 and A8 road  schemes. (AQO 1454/10<a name="AQO1454/10" id="AQO1454/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development &nbsp;(Mr Murphy)</strong>:  Roads Service has advised that the total amount spent to date on the A5  dualling scheme between Derry and Aughnacloy  is &pound;24,715,000. The total amount spent to date on the A8 dualling scheme  between Belfast  and Larne is &pound;3,135,000. Those figures include consultants&rsquo; fees, site investigations  and surveys and payments to the integrated delivery teams.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I am conscious that the Irish Government  have sustained their commitment to both projects despite the serious  difficulties in the Irish economy. Will the Minister confirm that our Executive  will sustain both projects in spite of any threats to our Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member is correct: the A8 and A5 schemes are  being part-funded by the Irish Government. I anticipate that the remainder of  the funding will be made available through the normal budgetary process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister tell the House  what is the expected timetable for the delivery of the A5 dualling scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Subject to satisfactory progress through the  statutory procedures and the availability of funds through a normal budgetary  process, it is anticipated that construction could start in 2012 and be  completed in 2015. It is expected that the draft vesting and direction Orders  and environmental statement will be published in November 2010. It is  anticipated that a public inquiry will take place in 2011. Subject to a  satisfactory outcome of the public inquiry and confirmation of the availability  of funding, construction work, as I said, is expected to start in 2012 and be  completed in 2015.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Minister detail how the consultants were appointed? How many  applications were received, and what scoring criteria were used in the process  to select the consultants?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The consultants were appointed by the normal process,  but I do not have details on how many applied and the scoring processes that  were used. I will respond to the Member in writing at a later date.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  In view of the number of serious accidents on the A8 over the years, when does  the Minister anticipate that the A8 scheme will start and be completed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Again, subject to satisfactory progress through the  statutory procedures and the availability of funds through a normal budgetary  process, it is anticipated that construction could start in 2012-13 and be  completed in 2015. The stage three assessment is under way, and it will  progress the scheme towards the publication of the draft vesting and direction  Orders and environmental statement by mid-2011.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Local Government</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Rev Dr  Robert Coulter </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what discussions  he has had with the Minister of the Environment in relation to the devolution  of functions to local government. (AQO 1455/10<a name="AQO1455/10" id="AQO1455/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member will be aware that the devolution of  functions to local government is part of the wider proposals to reform local  government under the review of public administration (RPA). That includes the  transfer of a range of functions from several Departments across the NICS  (Northern Ireland Civil Service). As a member of the RPA&rsquo;s Executive  subcommittee, I am in regular contact with the Minister of the Environment, who  chairs that subcommittee, as part of our role to oversee the implementation of  the reforms.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his response. Now that local government  reorganisation has collapsed, will the Minister indicate whether the Minister  of Finance and Personnel has expressed to him any views on the devolution of  functions to the 26 councils?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There has been a general discussion about that at the  Executive over a number of meetings. Obviously, I was disappointed with the  final result of the discussions, which was a decision not to proceed with the  11-council model. Ministers exchanged views across the Executive table on a  wide range of matters relating to that. I have not had any specific discussions  directly with the Minister of Finance and Personnel about transferring  functions, but I certainly would not be supportive of the idea of transferring  functions to the 26 councils, particularly given that some of the councils  already abuse some of their powers. In the absence of proper governance models  being introduced, I would certainly not be minded to transfer functions from  the Department for Regional Development (DRD) to the 26-council model.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am keen to ascertain whether the Minister foresees any transfer to local  government of responsibility for major strategic schemes for roadways, rather  than it just being responsible for minor maintenance? Has he considered that  issue with the Department and, if so, does he see that happening in a rolling  fashion over the next few years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in my previous response, I am not minded to  transfer any functions to the 26-council model. As part of a wide-ranging  discussion over a number of years, we were intending to transfer some powers,  including powers relating to car parks and traffic attendants, to an 11-council  model. Because road schemes, more often than not, will not be confined to any  one council area, it is the intention to keep Roads Service as the statutory  authority over road schemes and major works and not to transfer that power to  the councils.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Fra McCann to ask a supplementary question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has, in his last two  responses, answered the question that I was going to ask.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The Minister clearly does not intend to devolve any functions to the 26  councils in the foreseeable future. Therefore, does he accept that the RPA  exercise and the way that it has been carried out to date has been an abysmal  failure?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am sure that much useful preparatory work has been  done between councils. I have said publicly that I am very disappointed that  the decision to move to the 11-council model was not taken at the Executive. I  have made my views very clear on that. Whether anything can be picked up from  that has not been put to the Executive as yet. There has been no proposition on  where we go from here. With no agreement to move to an 11-council model, the  default position is to stick to the 26-council model. I do not doubt that some  of the work that has been done to date has proved useful in getting councils to  co-operate. Whether we can revisit the issue is a decision for the Executive. I  would be keen to see us move on to establishing an 11-council model, as we had  agreed two years ago, but, obviously, we cannot move on that on our own.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Northern Ireland Water: Procurement</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what steps he has  taken to date to improve his Department&rsquo;s oversight of the procurement  processes operated by Northern Ireland Water. (AQO 1457/10<a name="AQO1457/10" id="AQO1457/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My written ministerial statement on 12 March and  subsequent oral statement to the Assembly on 15 March set out the immediate  action that I took following the publication of the independent review team&rsquo;s  report on procurement governance failures in NIW (Northern Ireland Water). The  oral statement referred to an action plan that had been produced in response to  the report findings. That was subsequently agreed as a joint DRD/NIW action  plan, incorporating actions to enhance the Department&rsquo;s oversight of NIW. That  included taking forward a process to appoint interim board members to  temporarily replace the four non-executive directors who were removed, on which  I hope to make an announcement soon; DRD representation at NIW audit committee  meetings since March this year; an external review of the work undertaken by  NIW internal audit, which has been used to inform the internal review team&rsquo;s  (IRT) findings; a wider external review of the NIW internal audit function; and  the requirement for the Department to be informed about any proposed  single-tender actions above &pound;30,000 on a monthly basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am confident that the chief executive has, since  his appointment and subsequent to the findings of IRT&rsquo;s report, proactively  raised the profile of governance throughout NIW, the director of the  Department&rsquo;s shareholder unit liaises closely with him on an ongoing basis to  ensure that all actions are being addressed. Delivery against the action plan is  a standing item at the monthly meetings between the DRD senior finance director  and the chief executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of NIW&rsquo;s main actions was to widen the scope of the  audit into procurement governance. This was described as further &ldquo;deep-dive&rdquo;  audit work, and I agreed to keep Members informed about it as the findings  become known. I can now confirm that they will be made available on the  Department&rsquo;s website later today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Is he now satisfied that Northern Ireland Water  is being run to the highest standards of corporate governance and that  contracts are being tendered for properly?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: That is the point of all the actions that I have  outlined, which are a consequence of the independent review team&rsquo;s report and  which then led to a joint action plan between the Department and NIW. That has  led to a much closer working relationship and to a much greater emphasis being  placed on governance and procurement. I am confident that things have improved  dramatically since the matter was first brought to our attention earlier this  year. I am satisfied that these arrangements are now working. Experience over  time will test them properly. However, there has been a very substantial  improvement in relation to governance, audit and scrutiny of the award of  contracts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate what criteria and appointment processes, which were  not undertaken in the first instance, which led to the problems that the  independent review identified, were undertaken this time to ensure that the  interim board membership process was successfully concluded?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The problems that the independent review identified  were much more extensive than the appointment process for board members,  although I considered board members to be culpable in their governance and  scrutiny of some of the issues that were taking place at NIW. The difference  with the interim appointments is that they are described as being made on an  interim basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We had to reach agreement with the Commissioner for Public  Appointments to deviate from the normal appointments process. The selection  criteria for the four interim appointments were based on business and  stakeholder needs. A list of the names of potential candidates was drawn up and  individuals were contacted to gauge their interest, and they were asked to  submit CVs. Interviews, or conversations with a purpose, were then held by a  panel that contained an independent assessor. A further interview is scheduled  for later in the month, and I hope to be in a position to announce interim  appointments soon.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  With regard to all the problems that Northern Ireland Water faces, does the  Minister rule out any possibility that he will re-integrate Northern Ireland  Water as a corporate body directly into the Department for Regional  Development?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: All options are being considered in relation to the  future of NIW. It is now operating as a hybrid &mdash; between a Go-co and a  non-departmental public body &mdash; as far as accountability is concerned. However,  there are implications in bringing NIW back into the Department and those have  to be considered. It would have an impact on the Executive&rsquo;s financial  situation, and there would be possible financial risks around VAT and asset  valuation. There would be constraints in the public expenditure system on  issues such as efficiency, customer focus and long-term planning to maximise  return on investment. We are considering the course of action to take to secure  the best governance of NIW, but whatever we do will have implications.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Airports</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Beggs </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what influence his  Department has, through the regional development strategy, on proposals for  airports and their associated transport infrastructure requirements. &nbsp;(AQO 1458/10<a name="AQO1458/10" id="AQO1458/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The regional development strategy (RDS) recognises the  significant role that airports have in accessing markets, encouraging inward  investment and boosting tourism. The RDS is material to decisions on  development proposals for local airports and their associated transport  infrastructure. That means that when DOE is processing planning applications,  it must give due consideration to the policies set out in the RDS.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that it would be helpful if there were greater  responsibility for and greater influence on the development of airports, so  that we end up with the right investment in the right place and that road and  rail infrastructures are meshed appropriately? Does he also agree that there is  a need for greater responsibility over a wider geographical area and that  responsibility should be devolved?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There are a number of factors involved. One is an  ongoing discussion on aviation strategy. Responsibility for that lies at Westminster, and I have  said that I am happy to explore and to discuss with Executive colleagues  whether that is something for which we can accept responsibility. The Member  should also bear in mind that airports are privately owned and decisions about  investment and infrastructure are matters for the owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that we live on an island, airports are important  gateways. That is reflected in the regional development strategy and will be  reflected, possibly even more strongly, in the new regional development  strategy that is being processed. There is a clear recognition that the  infrastructure that gets people to and from the airports is important. Given  our geography and the nature of our economy, access to the airports is  important, and we will continue to bear that in mind.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. When does the Minister intend to publish  the revised regional development strategy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I intend to seek Executive approval to publish the  revised regional development strategy for consultation by this autumn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Given  the scope of the regional development strategy, I presume that the Department  will submit the Minister&rsquo;s response to the public inquiry on the proposed  extension of Belfast   City Airport.  Will the Minister assure me that he and his Department will take into account  the local residents&rsquo; ongoing opposition to that proposal?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The inquiry and the decisions that flow from it are a  matter for the Department of the Environment. However, on a number of  occasions, I have had the opportunity to meet with residents and with groups  and, indeed, with some of the elected representatives from the areas that are  affected by Belfast   City Airport.  I wrote to the Minister of the Environment encouraging him to hold a public  inquiry before taking his decision. I am not sure that there is a formal role  for DRD in that inquiry, but, nonetheless, we will be keeping an interested eye  on it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  If and when the Budget will allow such schemes to progress, will the Department  examine the possibilities of having railway links and halts at Londonderry and Aldergrove airports so that a truly  integrated public transport network can be achieved?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Those issues have been raised with me before. The  standard benchmark for the viability of rail halts at airports is if they serve  around 10 million passengers. I think that Aldergrove serves around seven  million, and the City of Derry Airport does not serve numbers in that region at  all. However, we will continue to keep that under review. Current and  anticipated finances would not allow us to make any moves in that direction in  the near future, but I will continue to listen to that argument as time goes  on.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">June Monitoring Round</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline his  Department&rsquo;s response to the June monitoring round. &nbsp;(AQO 1459/10<a name="AQO1459/10" id="AQO1459/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My Department submitted seven bids in the June  monitoring round exercise, six of which were resource bids totalling &pound;22&middot;2  million and one that was a capital bid for &pound;41 million. The bids totalled &pound;63&middot;2  million overall and covered a wide range of the Department&rsquo;s activities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Details of the resource bids are &pound;12&middot;6 million for  pressures arising from environmental work and contractor disputes in NIW; &pound;2&middot;3 million  to maintain the existing level of subsidies for concessionary fares schemes;  &pound;1&middot;3 million to meet the increased railway public service obligation; &pound;0&middot;6  million to meet the increased cost of the transport funds resulting from the  dial-a-lift service; &pound;4 million to meet the costs of maintaining the street  lighting stock; and &pound;1&middot;4 million to meet the increase in fuel duty rebate  costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was one capital bid for &pound;41 million for Roads Service  structural maintenance. If that bid is met, the allocation for 2010-11 would  match the level recommended in the independently assessed Snaith structural  maintenance funding plan. Members should also note that the backlog of  structural maintenance on our roads was measured at an unprecedented &pound;720  million in the September 2009 report. My Department also sought &pound;4&middot;5 million in  capital funding as part of the approved integrated development fund pilot  project that Ilex submitted for the A2 Broadbridge scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. As regards the resource bid of  &pound;2&middot;3 million for the concessionary fares scheme, will the Minister outline the  budgetary position of the scheme and what he intends to do if no funding is  available from the Department of Finance and Personnel?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Executive consider the concessionary fares scheme  to be important. I certainly consider it important. The bid for &pound;2&middot;3 million is  to maintain the existing levels of subsidy for that scheme. Fare concessions  that are available to those over the age of 60 and other vulnerable groups have  been successful in encouraging those groups to use public transport services  frequently in preference to private transport. That shows the benefit of having  affordable and accessible public transport services in achieving modal shift.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the scheme is demand led and inescapable pressures  have arisen, which explains the bid for additional funds. At this stage of the  year, that bid represents an estimate of the reimbursements required to  Translink for the scheme. As I said, I consider the scheme to be important, as,  I believe, do my Executive colleagues, and, therefore, I intend to secure the  finances necessary to ensure that it continues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Given that the Minister will be under severe financial pressures, has he any  plans to seek equity release from any agencies or bodies under his control?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There has been some discussion &mdash; I am not sure  whether it was at a previous Question Time &mdash; during which the Minister of  Finance and Personnel referred to equity release in relation to Belfast port. I am told  that that is not possible under the terms in which it was described. Therefore,  it is not something that we have considered. I do not consider myself to be under  severe financial pressure. The budgets are being challenged; we will probably  know more about that tomorrow. Nonetheless, the Executive need to have a mature  discussion about continued investment in the infrastructure as a way to help us  to endure the economic downturn and to put us in a better position to take  advantage when the situation improves.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Cairnshill Park-and-Ride Facility</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development when the Cairnshill  park-and-ride facility will open and what measures will be put in place to  facilitate public transport from the site to Belfast city centre. (AQO 1460/10<a name="AQO1460/10" id="AQO1460/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Plans for the introduction of a new park-and-ride  facility at Cairnshill are well advanced. Although the construction work on  site is largely complete, the procurement of bus services, together with the  introduction of further bus priority measures, must be finalised before the  site becomes fully operational. I hope to be able to announce the outcome of  the procurement in the autumn. In the meantime, I have asked officials to  investigate opening the car park as a park-and-share site and to consider how  existing Translink bus services could be used to benefit access to the city  centre.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  reply. He has visited the constituency and spoken to residents&rsquo; associations  and other local representatives about overall traffic management in the area.  Is the Minister able to assure the House that this project will be given every  priority to ensure that it and the necessary procurement are completed, so that  it can make an important contribution to traffic management in that overall  area?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said, work on the site is largely complete, and  we expect it to be fully completed by the end of June, that is, within the next  week or so. The site has space for 730 vehicles. Although the dedicated service  has not yet been procured, there is the potential to open the site for a  park-and-share scheme in the interim and to link its users with existing  Translink services that pass the site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member that it is an important part of  traffic management for the Ormeau    Road area and for the city as a whole. In the  initial phases, as we give more priority to quality bus corridors in that area,  private car users will feel the impact, and that may lead, initially, to their  experiencing some congestion. However, the purpose of park-and-ride sites is to  encourage private car users to leave their cars there and take public transport  into the city. I believe that such sites will eventually be highly successful  in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  Minister will be aware of many park-and-ride facilities throughout Northern Ireland,  but they are often used by people who do not get on a train or a bus. Has the  Minister considered introducing controls for existing park-and-ride facilities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am not aware of any specific complaints about  particular facilities at which people park but do not use public transport,  unless that is a park-and-share facility, and some park-and-ride sites include  park-and-share facilities. However, if the Member brings any specific  complaints about the operation of some of the sites to our attention, my  officials and I will ensure that the operators of those parks deal with the  issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given that the latest figures show  that single occupancy journeys increased by 14 million in 2006-08, does the  Minister accept that his policies are failing to get people out of their cars  and into more sustainable forms of transport?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: No, I do not accept that my policies have failed. I  am not sure what Mr Bradley&rsquo;s policies are, but I would be interested in  hearing from him about them. If he has some better ideas, I encourage him to  let me hear them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Very significant investment is going into infrastructure,  such as park-and-ride schemes and the plans that are being developed for a  rapid transit system around Belfast.  Although private car ownership is increasing, as it is all over the world, and  congestion is an ongoing issue, the correct policies are being followed,  namely, to provide a better, more efficient and higher priority public  transport network and to make it progressively more difficult for private cars  to access urban centres. That is the policy that we are pursuing. At a time  when making investments is not easy, the policy requires significant investment  in public transport and more restrictive measures for private cars. I think  that that is the correct policy to follow. If the Member has a better one, I  would be interested to hear about it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister&rsquo;s comments about  park-and-ride facilities and the number of people travelling into the city  centre are encouraging. The quality of life of pedestrians, given the movement  of buses in the city centre, is also important, and there have been some severe  accidents and serious incidents. The speed and type of buses &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, Mr McHugh.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  In relation to the control and management of buses within the city centre  itself, will the Minister look to the future in relation to the type of buses,  the noise that they create and, indeed, the speed and control with which they  are driven? Has that been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It has, and I recall the tragic accident in Belfast city centre that resulted in young Ciara Park  being killed by a bus. Work between Departments was already ongoing, and the  Member will know that the streetscape work in Belfast city centre is the responsibility of  the Department for Social Development. DOE also has an interest, and there have  been joint discussions and meetings about Belfast  city centre&rsquo;s immediate and longer-term future between the three Departments.  That is an ongoing piece of work. In the long term, we intend to remove buses  from the immediate city centre area. At the moment, in certain parts of the  city centre, their movement is restricted to one way. Obviously, given that the  area is becoming increasingly pedestrianised, the greatest attention possible  is being paid to safety issues. Pedestrian usage and bus usage can lead to a  conflict. There are long-term plans to progressively remove vehicles from the  city centre. In the interim, a great deal of attention is being paid to  pedestrian safety.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">A6 Randalstown to Castledawson</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline the  current position on the proposed A6 Randalstown to Castledawson road upgrade.  (AQO 1461/10<a name="AQO1461/10" id="AQO1461/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Roads Service has advised that it is continuing to  develop the A6 Randalstown to Castledawson dualling scheme. It plans to make  two direction orders later this year to facilitate the construction phase. It  is anticipated that work will commence on site in the 2011-12 financial year,  subject to the availability of finance at that time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that information, and the fact that his budget is not  under especial pressure gives us confidence that the project will proceed.  Given that work on the scheme will commence in the 2011-12 financial year, when  does the Minister expect it to be completed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The dualling scheme has been procured by way of a  design-and-build contract, and it will take about 24 months &mdash; two years &mdash; from  the start of construction to completion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I am disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s last answer. Given present financial  constraints and public opinion about the loss of farmland, I was hoping that  the Minister would tell us that the scheme will be put on the back burner for  some time. Even at this late stage, will consideration be given to looking at  another route or to putting the scheme off for some time?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: No. I am afraid that the intention is to go ahead  with the scheme. There are landowner issues, as there are with any road scheme,  big or small, particularly with respect to farmers&rsquo; access and compensation. In  any major infrastructure scheme, those are all difficult issues to deal with.  Nonetheless, the process is under way, and the benefits to members of the  public who travel to and from the north-west, between Belfast  and Derry, will be great, so the intention is  to go ahead with the scheme.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  The Minister is probably aware that there is disagreement about whooper swans  and the building of the new road. Are studies on the swans ongoing, and will we  be supplied with up-to-date facts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Many issues will be raised about the construction  project, of which that is one. Stringent environmental guidelines are in place  for any roads that are being built, and I am sure that the environmental  agencies will apply strict guidelines about what can and cannot be done. I do  not have a specific assessment of the ongoing examination of that issue, but I  am happy to write to the Member with any details that may be available.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What assurances can the Minister  give that local contractors will be involved in the work on the proposed  upgrade of the A6 from Randalstown to Castledawson?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: We must adhere to European rules on major  procurements. However, we will try to ensure that, where possible, local  contractors have the opportunity to tender for that type of work. Contract  awards for the A5 were broken into three pieces, which perhaps made it more  attractive to local contractors and not so attractive to international organisations.  To date, we have had good local contractors who are capable of undertaking such  work. Over the past number of years, schemes arrived on time, on budget and, in  many cases, ahead of schedule. I am sure that local contractors will be aware  of the potential for work. Given the difficult situation that they face, I very  much hope that they are able to secure that work.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget (No. 3) Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Budget (No. 3) Bill [NIA 26/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The passing of the Budget (No. 3) Bill will set the limits  on expenditure and the use of resources in 2010-11 and will enable the Assembly  to hold Departments accountable for managing and controlling that spending and  for the use of those resources within those limits. As the Excess Votes for  2008-09, which are in the Bill, demonstrate, any excess or excesses will be  identified during the audit of the departmental resource accounts and will be  reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Public Accounts  Committee (PAC). In turn, the PAC will examine the reasons for the excess and  make recommendations to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue in the vein of accountability to the  Assembly and take this opportunity to focus the Assembly&rsquo;s attention for a few  moments on the issues that it is now time to address. The current financial  process, which we inherited from direct rule, commenced with the Budget and  went through the legislative stages of Estimates and Budget Bills, which is  where we are today, to the out-turn of the departmental resource accounts. It  has existed for many decades in Northern Ireland  and is based on the Westminster  model. Various components of the process serve different purposes and have  developed over the years in individual directions. That has resulted in a  significant misalignment between Budgets, Estimates and accounts. In past  debates, Members commented on that misalignment, which is especially  demonstrated by the different figure work in the Budget document and the  Estimates. That misalignment is an area that should be reformed to improve  transparency and Assembly control. In addition, the revenue stream in the form  of rates legislation is taken forward as a separate process and, arguably,  should be linked with the expenditure process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One main area that requires radical reform is the lack of  transparency in the publications presented to the Assembly, in particular the  Estimates. In the past, Members commented that the publications did not lend  themselves to the easy scrutiny and challenge of spending proposals by the  Assembly. Departments&rsquo; spending proposals should be set out clearly in Budget  and Estimates publications not only to be scrutinised and challenged by the  Assembly but to enable accountability at a later stage for spend against those  proposals. Take, for example, education and health, which are two of the  biggest spending Departments. In the Budget document that was approved on 20  April and in the Estimates before us today, the majority of the spend in each  Department is contained in one or two lines. An expenditure line of over &pound;1  billion should be unacceptable to the Assembly, and it is time the Assembly  demanded greater transparency, with expenditure being split over different  spending programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the financial process is lengthy, convoluted and  repetitive &mdash; very repetitive on some occasions. I hope that it will not be repetitive  today, but I suspect that it might. Consultation, scrutiny, debate and  agreement of a Budget is followed by debates reopening the same Budget issues  during the legislative process. I enjoy a good debate, and, while it is  important in a democracy to debate the issues, especially important issues such  as public expenditure, the repetitive purpose of those debates is worth  examining, especially since a lot of the debate is about something that has  been agreed anyway.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage of devolution, it is time to discuss, consult  on and agree a process and publications that better suit the needs of the  Assembly. To that end, perhaps it is time for a review of the entire financial  process. We recently had a review of the Budget process in order to improve the  first stage of our financial process, but should we not look at the entire  financial process and at the various publications throughout that process with  a view to having a process and publications that will meet the needs of our  devolved Administration? The objectives of such a review could be to improve  transparency and the alignment between Budgets, Estimates and accounts;  radically simplify the Estimates; revise the budgetary structure of Departments  in order to achieve clarity in spending proposals and programmes; and  streamline the Budget, Estimates and legislative process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reform must be driven by the needs of the Assembly, and I  cannot stress that enough. A review taken forward by DFP or by the Executive  without the engagement of Members would not achieve its goals; in fact, it  might be regarded with some suspicion. The Assembly should consider its needs  in relation to the entire process and the publications laid before it.  Extensive consultation with the Assembly on reform would be imperative. The  official avenues for consultation would be the Committee for Finance and  Personnel and the Public Accounts Committee. However, I welcome the  constructive views of individual Members today or in the coming months on the  matter. In addition, my officials would need to consult the Comptroller and  Auditor General on the issues impacting on his office, on accounts and on his  role as the controller of the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund. I issue a  challenge to the Assembly today to consider major reform of our financial  process to meet the needs of the Assembly. The desire for reform must come from  the Chamber, and I welcome Members&rsquo; views in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, as we come to the final debate in this  legislative process, I remind the House that the amounts of cash and resources  sought in the Budget (No. 3) Bill for 2010-11 are substantial on top of the  Vote on Account approved in March, bringing the total cash to more than &pound;13  billion and the resources to more than &pound;14 billion. However, as stated in  earlier debates, the Chancellor&rsquo;s announcement on 24 May has already dented  those amounts, and the Executive are dealing with that as part of the June  monitoring round. As we await the Chancellor&rsquo;s emergency Budget tomorrow, we can  be certain that the financial road ahead will be rough. However, Members have  been elected to deliver high-quality public services to the people of Northern Ireland,  and we must still do that within our reduced resources. That is the challenge  that lies ahead, and I look forward to hearing Members&rsquo; views today in that  vein.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I want to speak first as the Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel and then as an MLA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I stated in an earlier debate on the Bill, the Committee  for Finance and Personnel is aware of the potential consequences for  departmental spending and front line services should the Bill not progress  through the Assembly before the summer recess. In that regard, the Committee  was content for the Bill to proceed under accelerated passage. However, the  Committee continues to be mindful of the concerns raised by other Statutory  Committees about the lack of engagement with their respective Departments  throughout the latest Budget process. Therefore, I am pleased that the Minister  has called on his Executive colleagues to engage early and meaningfully with  their Committees as we move into the 2010 Budget process, which will establish  departmental baseline expenditure for 2011-14.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following a request for assurances about improved  consultation and transparency in future Budget processes, the Minister provided  the Committee with an early timetable for the 2010 Budget process, and that has  been shared with the other Statutory Committees. On 30 June 2010, the Committee  for Finance and Personnel will take evidence from DFP officials on their  initial plans and priorities for the Budget 2010 process. I encourage other  Departments to engage with their Statutory Committee at the earliest  opportunity, because it is imperative that Committees are afforded adequate  time to properly perform their scrutiny role. Having reiterated those key  concerns, I support the motion that the Budget (No. 3) Bill do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an MLA, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s earlier comments. There  is a view that we are facing a situation in which we will have less money to  spend on public services. I apologise in advance if I repeat myself a little  today, but we must have the debate on how we can protect essential front line  services and ensure that the families and businesses that need help from the  Executive get that help. We often get caught up in the argument about where we  will find new money, but that is not always what is required; it is about using  the money that we have more wisely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes I feel like a parrot because I repeat myself so  much, but public procurement is one area that we can influence to ensure that  all public spending in that area maximises the wider economic and social  benefits to our community. I am aware that the Minister is looking at the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendations on public procurement, but that type of procurement  must be opened up to smaller businesses and the social economy sector to enable  them to access contracts in the same way as larger firms. Social clauses must  also be inserted. It is essential that we look at how we can target areas of  disadvantage and need and how we can ensure that companies that are awarded  contracts meet the basic conditions, including providing good wages and  employing apprentices and the long-term unemployed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  A number of weeks ago, I attended a conference in County Down with the  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development and other members of the  Committee. At that conference, a representative from the Welsh Assembly spoke  about how the Welsh have used procurement contracts to open up apprenticeships  and about how social clauses were included in those contracts. The  representative said that that approach has had a great impact on how things are  dealt with. There still seems to be some hesitancy here about adopting those  procurement ideas. Does the Member agree that, particularly in the current  economic climate, we should tap into the expertise in Wales and use  it here?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: That is certainly an issue that  we could look into. I also hope that the Minister and the Central Procurement  Directorate give weight to the 30 recommendations in the Committee&rsquo;s report on  public procurement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those recommendations will go a long way to helping the  public procurement spend be used as the strategic tool that we have discussed  in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to concentrate on areas in which money is already there,  as opposed to looking for new money. Credit union legislation is going through Westminster. Credit  unions have expressed an interest in investing in social economy enterprises in  local communities. Targeting social need would generate employment and regenerate  those communities. It is important that, when that legislation has passed  through Westminster,  the Assembly and the Executive take the necessary steps to ensure that credit  unions&rsquo; financial investment powers are brought into the arena. Credit unions  are currently investing their money in banks, which are coming in for criticism  for not lending to businesspeople here. We need to look at banks&rsquo; failure to  address their failings, because, we must remember, they were given public  money. I know that we have talked about that issue before, but the banks were  given that public money to try to kick-start the economy, and some businesses  cannot get loans from the banks or are having loans called in by them. It is  imperative for business that we look at the credit unions and at the way in  which they can make financial investment in areas such as the social economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look at all the different areas. We are facing  public spending constraints, so it is essential that we consider whether we are  getting the outcomes from spending that we need and that are set out in the  Programme for Government. I know that an opportunity is coming for the  Programme for Government to be reviewed, and it might be timely for that review  to reflect the current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether we choose to engage in that level of debate, we  need to engage with communities. The poverty in those communities is very real.  There are still 100,000 children living in poverty in the North of Ireland. It  seems that, no matter what we do to deliver services, we are not bringing  children out of poverty. Those children are still getting up in the morning and  going to school hungry because their parents do not have the money to pay for  electricity when the meter runs out at 8.00 am on a Monday. They do not have  the money for electricity to provide light and heat and to cook a breakfast.  Generational poverty is perpetuated, because those children are never given a  fair chance in life from birth. Children who are born into a household in which  two parents do not work or who are born in an area of social need should be  given the same life chances as a child from a more affluent area or family. We  need to take a strategic approach and put money into those families, children  and schools for early intervention. We need to look at that holistically and do  something for those children at a very young age to lift them out of poverty.  One of the main ways to lift a child out of poverty is to give the child&rsquo;s  parents a job. Public procurement can be used in a way that will create  employment opportunities for parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, there are ways to spend our money more wisely.  However, we need to measure that. We must also measure the outcomes. I sense  that, after government money has been invested in a service, there is no  measurement of whether it has worked and whether the targets have been reached.  When we consider the entire budgetary process, it is essential that we build  into it the cross between the Programme for Government and the Budget. We  should also build in a tool to measure whether the money that we spend delivers  the set priorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will, I hope, be given the opportunity to discuss that  issue in more detail. I hope that the Assembly and the Executive will take on  board the disadvantage and need in our communities and target spend on the  families, businesses and communities that need it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  On behalf of my party, I welcome the seamless and fairly painless passage of  this essential legislation. In doing so, I welcome the debate so far. The  Minister&rsquo;s criticism of the process is absolutely justified. We have gone  through the same process time and time again. In fact, I probably could have  reread a speech from the Final Stage of a previous Budget Bill, and no one  would have batted an eyelid.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: How do we know that you will not do that?<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I will repeat this speech next year to see whether anyone catches on. Given  that the process has many failings, which I want to touch on, it allows us to  have a debate. I hope that the Minister appreciates that today&rsquo;s debate has  been a little more mature than some previous Budget Bill debates. The debate  will be even more mature given the absence of certain Members. As the  Chairperson said and as the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks, the  context in which we now discuss Budgets has changed from that of three years  ago. We all know the context of public spending restraints, if not cuts, that  we must face. That has encouraged Members to be a bit more mature and more  measured in their comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the need to reform our entire  budgetary process, and I was glad to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that  today. It is, perhaps, typical that, during the Final Stage of a Budget Bill  that could have gone through easily, the Minister threw down a challenge to  Assembly Members. However, if I have read the comments from all parties in the  Committee for Finance and Personnel correctly, many of us will seize that  challenge with relish. The Minister is absolutely right to make those comments.  There is a growing sense of dissatisfaction among Members and a feeling that  the whole process is, in many respects, pointless. That is borne out of many  reasons and frustrations. The Minister has spoken of his frustration at the  lack of departmental engagement with Committees, the incompleteness of the  information provided to Committees and, at times, the complete lack of  transparency even when the information is provided. We should all be critical  of our own performance and question whether we truly test the expenditure that  comes before us. Even were all the available information provided in a timely  way, would our testing of expenditure be thorough enough? Sadly, the answer is  no. Budget Bills and monitoring rounds come around again and again, and I fear  that we fall into automatic pilot when scrutinising Budgets and expenditure in  the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is that fear or frustration that Members cannot  change anything. That has got to rub off on the general public and stakeholders  who may think that they cannot change anything either. Therefore, given the  context of the public spending constraints that we face, there is a deep desire  to change that process so that we are as thorough as possible and can walk away  from every Budget process and say that we tested everything with the degree of  scrutiny that was absolutely required. Therefore, the challenge that the  Minister has thrown down is one that I wish to seize with relish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even though there is a sense of doom and gloom about  Budgets in Northern Ireland,  it should be noted that this Budget still allows for considerable investment in  our public services, not least in ongoing record investment in our  infrastructure right across Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Final Stage of the Bill. It is, at least, one  Budget this week that we will all welcome; I am not too sure about the one that  we will hear about tomorrow. In fact, I suspect that we will run a million  miles away from it in respect of some of the pain that it will cause.  Nevertheless, I welcome the Final Stage and the challenge that the Minister has  thrown down to everybody in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I apologise to you, Mr Speaker, to the House and to the Minister for missing  his introductory remarks. I hope that nothing I say retrospectively steals his  thunder. It might, but I will go ahead anyway.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are at the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage. I have huge sympathy with  many of Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s remarks and with some of Ms McCann&rsquo;s. We seem to be in a  perpetual cycle of sameness, debating the same pot of money and the same sort  of issues in the same sort of way. Therefore, it may be opportune to take a few  moments to talk about what we might do differently during this Final Stage  debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose that it boils down to two basic questions. The  first is how we raise our money. There is a little bit of what we will want to  spend that we are able to raise ourselves. The second is a matter of  negotiation, for those who are much better at that than me, with the powers  that be in other places. However, I think that it is an opportune time,  possibly in light of tomorrow&rsquo;s Westminster Budget, after we come back after  the summer break and think about the next Assembly, our comprehensive spending  review and the heads of the new Programme for Government, to reflect on some of  the big questions that we need to pose about how we raise revenue in this  region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first question that I would like to pose is about the  rating system as it stands and whether it is fit for purpose. We have ended up  in a debate about water charges on the periphery of this Budget, a debate that  will continue to raise its head until, somehow or other, we settle the question  of that &pound;200 million that we keep pushing down the pipe &mdash; pardon the pun &mdash; and  find some mechanism for being able to fund it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am encouraged by the tone that the Member has taken in facing up to the reality  of revenue-raising. That has not always been the case on the part of his party.  In respect of the comment about pushing the issue down the pipe and the  implications of that, is the SDLP, in essence, now facing up to the reality  that water charges have to be introduced?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: If  Mr McDevitt is also saying no, what is the point of the line of argument that  he is taking?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Like the Minister, the SDLP says no. We do so proudly and consistently, because  water charges in the current budgetary structure are not the solution. That is  part of the point that I am in the process of making.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are probably at the point where we need to ask  fundamental questions about our rating system per se, because it is clear from  where we are sitting that it should accommodate the cost of water. However, it  is clear from where other people are sitting that it does not. It is certain  that every householder and, I suspect, most of us sitting in the Chamber pay  rates, but none of us feels that we get particularly good value out of what we  pay. None of us gets a sense of what we are actually paying for. We do not  really know or understand where our regional contribution goes, and we  certainly do not know where our local government contribution goes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I understand the point that the Member made about  the regional rate. So far as the Bill goes, there will be a separation.  However, as far as the district rate is concerned, most councils now detail,  with quite a lot of information, exactly what the money is spent on. The  regional rate does not go into pockets of money; it goes into general  expenditure and is a bit more difficult to define.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  They do so at a corporate level; the Minister is right in that regard. There is  still a significant disconnect between the ratepayer or the customer of  government services &mdash; be that at local government level or at regional  government level &mdash; and the rate bill. It may be a time for us to take a look at  what we believe falls within the rate envelope and to ask ourselves whether the  bodies, structure and policies that we have around rating are suitable for that  purpose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hear a lot of criticism, and I am sure that colleagues do  too, about the rating agency and whether it is able to do its job on a  day-to-day basis. I know that that matter has been debated at other times in  the Chamber, so I will not dwell on it too much, but now is the time for us to  start asking that first question about where our money comes from. Is it time  to start a conversation about what rates are, what they should pay for and how  we should formulate a policy around them?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second matter is about thinking of smaller, imaginative  innovations that could be used as revenue-raising opportunities. In the  Minister&rsquo;s reply, I would be most interested to hear his opinion on Mike  Smyth&rsquo;s suggestion of a levy on text messages, for example. We never seem to  think outside the box when considering how revenue could be raised elsewhere,  and I will come to that in the second part of my comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is the question of asset leverage. The investment  strategy sits slightly outside the Budget that we are talking about today for obvious  and important reasons, but again, in that regard, we stumble along. I suppose  that we can forgive ourselves for doing so over the first seven or eight years  of this millennium because of the bigger politics of the situation, but we are  yet to come to terms with the opportunity to leverage our asset base. There  also needs to be a big conversation on the broader question of equity release.  Although the Minister took a strong view during the Bill&rsquo;s previous stage on  the opportunities to release equity from such bodies as the Harbour  Commissioners, only 20 minutes ago and 10 yards from where I stand, the  Minister for Regional Development took an opposite view on whether that was  possible, never mind whether it was a good idea. As an Assembly, we should have  the debate about how to raise money; we owe it to ourselves and to the people  who sent us here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second debate relates to what we do with the money and  how we spend it. Ms McCann made a very important point when she talked about  need and the fact that, at every level in our society &mdash; be it at the most  deprived levels, where support is most needed from the state; at the level  where young people are leaving school or college and looking for work with no  prospects of finding any; at small businesses and their frequent argument to us  that they do not feel that the region is rolling behind them; or the other  government services, in which people argue that they are not being funded in  the way that they should &mdash; the question of whether our Budget is about funding  Departments or funding need is begging to be asked. If it is about the latter,  does continuing to fund Departments in the traditional, old-fashioned way enable  us to fund need or is it becoming an obstacle to it?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has talked about my next subject in the past, but  I have not, so I will indulge myself briefly. The first Executive had a  mechanism called the Executive programme funds. It was abolished the minute  that the first Executive fell. I know that, privately, the Minister is not  averse to us returning to the idea of programmatic funding. We need to stop  allowing Departments to act as gatekeepers rather than enablers, and we need to  return to this place, in the autumn or after the next election, with  imaginative ways that will allow us to send a signal to the people &mdash; the young  workers, those who need health and social services, carers &mdash; that we can fund  need. That need is not merely social, it is also economic. It is about  innovation and linking up what the Department of Education, the Department for  Employment and Learning (DEL) and the Department for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (DETI) need to do in order to realise the employment opportunity of  this region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the last level, we also need to be able to bring the  compassion and the opportunity to use regional funding and regional spending to  help those who are most on the margins of society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For most county towns in rural areas, nothing is more  important than investment. It is important in the cities too. Capital  investment means that jobs can be created, but when people in local communities  do not see themselves getting jobs when the road project or big regeneration  project comes through, they get disillusioned about the value of devolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Jennifer McCann that social clauses are hugely  important. My only regret is that, to date and for whatever reason, we have not  been able to get the most out of social clauses. Only last week, I asked the  Minister for Regional Development for figures. He has been able to produce only  eight jobs for long-term unemployed people in the past two years. It is not  that he does not want to produce more jobs, so it must be because there are  barriers in the process. If devolution is to mean something to me and to most  of us, we need to begin to address those barriers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his time  and efforts over the past couple of weeks. However, rather than talk about a  Budget, I agree with the Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development  that this is the easy part of what will be a very difficult conversation in the  months ahead. It is important at this stage that we reflect on the points that  have been made on the matter. How can we raise money differently? More  importantly, when we do so, how can we spend it in a way that changes lives?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Once again, I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Budget (No.3) Bill. In  some respects, this is a landmark, as it is the last formal debate on the  authorisation of the three-year Budget that the Executive and the Assembly  agreed. My party did not agree to it, because we were in opposition then.  However, today we are not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, as the Bill becomes law, some tidying up will  still need to be done through the monitoring rounds and, eventually, through  the spring Supplementary Estimates. Over the year, those monitoring rounds may  take on considerable importance in the context of what we have to do to  implement the cuts from the Treasury.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make a number of points, but I will do my best to  avoid repeating what was said during the debates on the preceding stages of the  Bill. The process has gone relatively smoothly overall. I emphasise the  importance of the economic interface in our approach to public expenditure in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, a lot of the macroeconomics lie outside the Executive&rsquo;s direct  control, but there are implications for the way in which we spend money. In the  light of the ongoing economic situation, that has to remain our primary  concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate the point that I made last week about the  importance of rebalancing the economy by balancing demand-side intervention  with the supply side to free up the costs for companies and individuals so that  they can spend money. I would tend to focus more on the supply side, because  investments in that area can have an impact on demand. However, as we emerge  from recession, it is important that we take every available opportunity to try  to shift the terms of the debate on our economy locally. Our economy has major  structural problems, not least the dependency on both the public sector and a  relatively small private sector with low productivity. To simply free up money  for the demand side often does not tackle those fundamental structural  difficulties. We must be mindful of the balance when we pitch the economic  assistance that we give through public expenditure, which is limited.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having reflected on some of the comments that were made  last week, in particular those of the Minister of Finance and Personnel in his  winding-up speech on the Second Stage of the Budget (No.3) Bill, I particularly  acknowledge what he said about North/South co-operation. I hope that I will not  get him into too much trouble with his party for saying this, but I found his  comments to be particularly encouraging. I apologise if I misquote or  misrepresent him, but, leaving aside the issue of structures, which may be  important in some cases and unimportant in others, he said that, in essence,  where there is logic in doing something on either an all-island or a more  limited cross-border basis and it makes financial and economic sense, there is  no good reason not to do it, as long as we respect and abide by our  constitutional situation. That is encouraging, and there should be scope over  the next few months for having more rounded debates in the Chamber and  elsewhere on how we can take that agenda forward for our local benefit here in Northern Ireland,  leaving aside any other benefits that may accrue from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to take up the comments made by Conall McDevitt  on revenue raising &mdash; he has gone quiet all of a sudden. It is important that we  are realistic about the need to raise revenue. I was encouraged by the start of  his comments but became more disappointed as he went along, because he was  raising the issue in a tantalising way, but not actually grasping some of the  essentials. When he was challenged about the issue of water charges, he ducked  it and said that it is a flat no. The fundamental reality we have to face in  this society is that the continued deferment of water charging &mdash; or, as Conall  McDevitt described it, the funding that we keep &ldquo;pushing down the pipe&rdquo; &mdash; costs  our block grant around &pound;200 million every year. The deferral of water charges  is not covered by the block grant; it is a decision we have to take, and it  comes at an opportunity cost for revenue that could be invested elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Mr Farry seems determined to have the debate within the confines of the status  quo and on the assumption that there is nothing wrong with the rating system,  that it is absolutely fit for purpose and delivers exactly what is was designed  to do. However, there is the opinion, not just on the SDLP Benches, but  outside, and probably across the House, that, in fact, the rating system has  some big problems. My question is not about whether we need to fund water. We  all agree that we need to fund water, but differ on the question of how. That  is the issue. Does Mr Farry agree that the rating system is, at very best, just  about fit for the job it does?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful for those comments as they have teed up some of the comments I need  to make on the issue. Whether we raise revenue through a standing charge based  on the value of property or we simply add the cost of water on to the rates, in  effect, the overall net impact is fairly similar: households will be paying  more. It could be done as part of the rates or as a separate charge, but the  overall net effect is fairly similar. That particular point is something of a  distraction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The one downside about making that increase in order to  fund water as part of the regional rates process is that essentially it is  being said that the only way of funding water is according to the value of property.  That does not take into account the potential for reflecting usage of water in  households through metering, for example. There may well be advantages in doing  it separately.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There is, of course, an additional problem that has  not been considered: as rate payments are subject to housing benefit  opportunities, I imagine there would be a difficulty with Treasury if we were  to include a charge for a service in a tax on which people could obtain some  alleviation through housing benefit. Therefore, leaving aside the charges that  were mentioned, whether funding for water should be raised through rates is  another matter that we need to take into consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Further to the Minister&rsquo;s comments, the other consideration has to be the  implications in relation to the European Union, and what the expectation would  be from that source on how income for water is going to be raised. I appreciate  that the Minister is not a fan of the European Union, but I understand that  Conall McDevitt and I share a common interest in supporting it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth bearing in mind that we have had a significant  discussion in the Assembly regarding rates. It was one of the first issues  raised during this mandate back in the spring of 2007, and we have had a  comprehensive piece of legislation since then. In some respects, the issue of  rating reform has now been settled, at least for a decade or so. I do not think  there is a huge appetite for returning to that. There were certainly aspects of  that that I was uncomfortable with. I have always said that I would rather that  we levied rates or local charges based on people&rsquo;s income as opposed to the  value of their property. Although property is a fairly good measure of ability  to pay, it is a blunt instrument in some respects. Given the problem of people  who are asset rich but income poor, an income-based approach would be better.  That may be what Mr McDevitt intended when he suggested that we need to reform  the basis on which we raise revenue. However, his party was not prepared to  entertain such a suggestion when rating reform was discussed a matter of months  ago.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make a final point about rates. If we go down the  line of, as was suggested, explaining for what the regional rate is used, that  rate will become, by implication, a hypothecated tax, which means that it is  raised for particular purposes, rather than for general revenue. The current  approach is the fairest one, because money can be spread across all  Departments. If revenue were raised for particular areas, flexibility in the  management of resources would be curtailed. That could create some distorted  and bizarre outcomes and lead to certain areas that receive public money being  regarded as privileged, and vice versa. I have concerns about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt raised the issue, but I do not want to be  completely unfair to him in my comments. Therefore, to widen my comments, I  must say that I detect a lack of maturity in this debate from a whole host of  quarters in the Assembly. Economists are saying in public that the Executive  and Assembly simply have to bite the bullet and raise additional revenue.  Householders here are not being asked to pay at the same levels as people  elsewhere, and, as a consequence, our ability to invest in public services and  to improve the economy is being compromised. Parties that stand up and complain  about cuts need to put their hands up and say that they are not prepared to  take the leap. They must be realistic and accept that, in return for providing  better public services, we need to ask people to pay more. That is the only  honest and frank way in which we can approach the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth reinforcing the point that the method used for  raising additional revenue will be linked to ability to pay. The measures that  we have at present may not be perfect, but that broad relationship exists.  However, the inverse is true in another respect. The vulnerable in society  depend proportionally more on public services, particularly the Health Service.  We need only look at the issue of health inequalities to see those figures  appear in stark relief. We are robbing those services by continuing with what  is, in effect, a subsidy for the better-off in society. Water charges, if they  are introduced, will be linked to ability to pay. The approach that not only  certain political parties but trade unions have taken to the issue of water  charges is utterly baffling. They cannot have it both ways. We have to make  tough decisions and choices. It is about more than rhetoric. We must be  prepared to put our hands up for some very difficult choices that we must make  to move the situation along.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final issue that I wish to talk about is health. I was  most disturbed by comments that the Health Minister made during last Tuesday&rsquo;s  Question Time when I asked him about consultant provision. He referred to the  justice budget and made disparaging remarks when he spoke about his attitude to  healthcare for prisoners and that for the ordinary population.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s points were not in any way disparaging of health provision for  prisoners. It seems to be a priority for the Alliance Party Minister and Members from the  Alliance Party to spend money on prisoners rather than on protecting the budget  for patients.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  First, Mr Kennedy needs to go back and read Hansard. His comments confirm the  point that a number of Members made, in particular Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n. There are  circumstances in which prisoners are patients, and not either prisoners or patients.  The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is responsible,  through the South Eastern Health and Social Trust, for healthcare in the Prison  Service. The implication of the Minister&rsquo;s remarks was that certain patients  will be prioritised over others who happen to be prisoners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was the intent that most Members took from the  comments made by the Health Minister. He was skirting a very fine line around  his equality responsibilities to all people in Northern Ireland who use the services  provided by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  He is the victim of a political ambush.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the issue was raised, I said that I recognised the  importance of ring-fencing the budget for the Department of Justice in the  short term, not least given the dissident threat. I draw Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s attention  to the fact that his party, along with many others, is lobbying hard for the  Chief Constable to be given the correct resources to take on the dissidents.  However, I regard ring-fencing as a short-term solution. In the medium term,  the Justice Department will have to compete for scarce resources and,  therefore, cut its cloth accordingly, just as every other Department has to.  The Executive will have to decide between the prioritisation of health,  education and justice services. That is the situation in which we find  ourselves at present.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I hope that the Member is not indicating that his party is being complacent  about the threat posed by dissidents, particularly in south Armagh  in my constituency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Far from it. I must point out to the Member that it was his party that cast  aspersions on the ring-fencing of funding for the Department of Justice, which  is critical to ensuring that resources are passed on to the Police Service. The  Member cannot have it both ways. He knows quite well that the Justice Minister  is standing four-square behind the Chief Constable on the resources that are  required to take on the dissidents, not just in south Armagh, but across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on the health budget. Last week, I said  that we needed to compare spending profiles in Northern Ireland with other areas  to find out whether we are spending proportionately more in areas such as  health and education and proportionately less in areas such as transport and  the environment. We must try to learn the lessons from that while respecting  our ability to make our own priorities. We must draw on what is happening  elsewhere for guidance. That also applies within Departments. Given that the  Health Department receives such a large proportion of our Budget, MLAs should  focus most of their attention and debate on that in the coming months. As the Westminster cuts come in  greater force over the coming years, the situation will become more acute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I go back to my remarks about funding need rather than funding Departments.  Does the Member accept that the Health Department is, in fact, the best  possible example of that? Health is a massive bureaucracy, which includes the  NHS with all its layers, the Department and the ancillary agencies that have an  input. Does the Member agree that we should identify priority areas of health  and social service need and prioritise those areas in financial terms? To do  that, we need to acknowledge that the solution may not just lie in the Health  Department&rsquo;s budget. For example, in the area of public health, money from the  education budget may be needed for investment, or, in other areas, money from  the DETI budget, the DEL  budget or the Department for Social Development (DSD) budget may be needed. That  is why, from the point of view of transforming societies, a programmatic  approach to funding will always be more effective than a departmental silo  approach.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Having been very critical of Mr McDevitt earlier, I now agree with every word  that he has said &mdash; I say that to encourage him. In health, there is a need for  focus on areas such as early intervention and prevention, and many of those  initiatives require co-operation between Departments and an ability to think  outside the context of narrow silos. Therefore, I am more than happy to concur  with the thrust of what the Member said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a similar vein, we need to look at the spending profile  in the Health Department. In Northern Ireland,  we spend less per capita on mental health &mdash; about 9% &mdash; than the UK average of  13%. In other areas of health, local spending profiles are different from  profiles elsewhere in these islands. That begs the question; what are we doing  more of or spending disproportionately more on than is the norm elsewhere? In  examining that, we will find some immediate savings, which can be reinforced by  the trend of how we approach outcomes, as Mr McDevitt outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to reinforce the point that health is an important  service. In Northern Ireland,  our health spending per capita is well ahead of the UK average. That is justified on  the basis of our having health needs which are much greater than elsewhere in  the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, our investment in health has been flatlining  during the three-year Budget period that we are coming to the end of, so we  have been falling behind in our level of health investment. Despite that, I  have great difficulty with the Health Minister coming here time after time and  lecturing other parties for saying that he has to take his share of the cuts.  We have to remember that the Health Minister referred to the final Budget  settlement that was agreed in February 2008 as a good deal for health. What was  a good deal back then cannot be a bad deal today. I thought that it was a bad  deal, but he thought that it was a good one. By saying that it was a good deal,  he was putting his money up front.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Leaving that aside, it is important that we be realistic  about how we take health forward in the context of falling budgets. I reiterate  that it is not productive to ring-fence the health budget. That is a difficult  thing for people to say, but the budget realities suggest that that must be the  situation. There are two reasons for that. First, we need to encourage changes  in the Health Service, just like everywhere else, and if you fix a budget, the  prospects of reform are diminished. Secondly, if the health budget is  ring-fenced, the implications for all other public services will be tremendous.  So, there are huge issues there that we need to get to grips with within  health.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need partnership between MLAs, rather than a situation  where we keep hitting a brick wall because the Minister simply says that he  wants his budget ring-fenced and that he is not prepared to entertain or  discuss how he will manage cuts that are agreed by the Executive until they are  forced upon him. That is not a productive way forward, and in the area where  the Executive are spending the greatest amount of money we need a much more  productive relationship than we have at present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments about looking at a new  way of budgeting. No doubt, that will be the subject of much greater  discussion, and he has given us plenty of food for thought. Given that the hour  is passing on, I will not entertain myself on that subject now. I look forward  to returning to that debate in due course.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill. In the past, in the Committees that I  am on, I have spoken out against the use of accelerated passage. However, when  there is no other option, we need to support its use. This is one such time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I realise the difficulties that Committees have faced in  trying to get information from Departments. I certainly believe that that  information was required at the Committee Stage to allow a good and  constructive debate. By the time we finally received that information from  Departments, there was not enough time to scrutinise the departmental budgets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the nature of many of the issues that we deal with at  the Committee for Social Development, the lack of time that we had to debate  our departmental budget caused problems for all of us. The Committee deals with  issues such as poverty, social deprivation, housing in its many elements,  social security, community regeneration and town and urban regeneration. In  many ways, those are issues that go to the heart of service provision for those  in society who are most in need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of our Committee felt that they had been treated  shabbily and short-changed when it came to the proper scrutiny of the  departmental budget. That was made all the more difficult because of some of  the issues in terms of where the reductions in budgets will fall and the impact  that they will have on front line services. We ended up with a figure of how  much will be cut, but it contained nothing on how that would affect those who  rely on that money or how the reductions would impact on those organisations  that provide front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard MLAs on other Committees saying the same thing  about the lateness and lack of information from Departments. Such behaviour is  wrong at any time, but it is doubly wrong in the present economic climate.  Ministers and Departments need to understand that we are all in this together.  People expect us to work efficiently. Departments should not see Committees as  enemies; they should see them as additional assets that will make good  suggestions and observations and, at times, raise concerns that will help  Ministers and Departments to come to the right decisions. That will also ensure  that issues are taken on board, especially in the dire economic times in which  we find ourselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel recently received a  briefing from NISRA on its findings on deprivation throughout the North, and it  was quite shocking.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those areas that have suffered from generational  deprivation, unemployment, poor health and poor educational attainment are  getting worse, and there is always a fear among many organisations that work in  those areas that the services that they provide are the first to be targeted  for cuts.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I heard the Health Minister, who receives more than half  the Budget, saying that he should be getting more of the block grant or that  his budget should be ring-fenced against cuts. It is his right to say that, but  people who live in areas that suffer from serious community safety problems  also face severe deprivation, unemployment, lack of housing, poor educational  attainment, lack of proper childcare, poor diets, and poor health and low life  expectancy because of their postcodes. All those issues must be tackled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If areas that have nothing in the way of services are not  dealt with, it will cost the Health Service many millions of pounds to deal  with the serious consequences of poverty and deprivation. A strategy to deal  with that will lead to huge savings not only for the Health Service but for  other Departments. Those who live in areas of high social deprivation should  have an equal shout for additional resources, even in times of financial  hardship, or such resources should, at least, be ring-fenced against cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Budgets should be allocated on the basis of need. We need  to deal with those issues by targeting social need and deprivation in their  many facets. If we fail to do that, the next NISRA report will show that the  same areas are continuing to get worse, and we will again have failed those  most in need. We have the power to make change, but what we need is the will to  make that change. That can be done by the proper targeting of resources to  those areas of severe need, which have, for generations, been left out of the  boom times and the times of plenty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When Ministers are looking to cut their budgets, I appeal  to them to ensure that those services that deal with areas of social  deprivation and front line community services are not the first port of call  when the cuts axe falls. We all know that we are in tough times and that tough  decisions will have to be made, especially in the aftermath of tomorrow&rsquo;s  Budget. However, I appeal to Ministers to ensure that, whatever happens, we  keep in mind those most in need and take on board that even a small cut to  those services could have a devastating impact on the communities that depend  on them. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Not so many are interested in  following the debate today, but the interests and issues are exactly the same.  It is vital that although we are taking a new look at the whole business of  strategy or, indeed, how we go about the Budget in the future, we look after  those most in need. That is the key.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I spoke about the cutting of the cake. If anyone  looks at the pie chart of any Department, they will see that, year on year, the  area on the chart for capital spending or anything else, outside salaries and  looking after the departmental budget, gets smaller and smaller. It is for  Departments to look at how that can be reduced, and also for the Minister or,  indeed, perhaps us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned that if the public think that the  money that is available is not being used effectively, they will frown upon  what we do here. The public have been asked by a number of people here to take  more cuts or, indeed, to accept an increase through something such as water  charges. Domestic bills, and the number of bills that come into an average  household, have increased enormously over the years. A lot of people will  certainly look badly upon what we do here if that does not change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I tried to find figures for various Departments. There is  no single document concise enough to show the cost of salaries and privileges  in each Department or the minutiae of spend in departmental budgets. There are  more than 100 different bodies in the public sector &mdash; some would call them  quangos. Other bodies, such as those that deal with IT in health, and so on,  may not be referred to as quangos, but there can be as many as two people for  every nurse, or maybe three in some instances. Those are the kinds of things  that raise costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Someone from the UK mentioned on a news programme  over the weekend that some people receive salaries of as much as &pound;200,000 or  &pound;250,000. That eats into the pensions budget for years to come, and we need to  watch it. No one is able to tell me exactly how many salaries are at that level  and how many we will have to carry in the years to come. The Assembly has not  looked at that area so far. Many will not like to hear it, but I am sorry to  say that if cuts are to target everyone, we must look at everything.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Early intervention was mentioned. Our approach to obesity,  type 2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses that are costly to society and the  health of society is to try to fix them. We focus on fixing problems rather  than on early intervention, educating kids at school, and so on. We need to  operate in a manner that will bring about future savings and efficiencies. We  must look long and hard at issues such as water charges. We cannot introduce  water charges unless we have already looked at everything else. It is important  that we do not raise our revenue artificially just to prop up and bolster the  ever-increasing impact on budgets so that people can milk the system even more  than they have done in the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support Jennifer McCann&rsquo;s point that there has not been a  tremendous change for people in the have-not category. Those who live in  poverty now lived in poverty through the boom and into the bust. The lot of  those people, in the North and South of the island, has not really improved  that much. Some communities, such as west Belfast  and parts of Enniskillen and wider Fermanagh, have improved through their own  efforts, but that needs to be sustained. Areas must not lay as wasteland for  another 10 years while we make up our mind about what we want to do in the  future. People who do not have fortune must be included.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I am glad that the Member mentioned west Belfast.  Although many communities in west Belfast and  right across the North have built fairly good community infrastructures, recent  NISRA statistics show that the lot of people in areas of west Belfast,  Derry, Strabane and north Belfast  has worsened rather than got better. Resources must be targeted to ensure that  those people catch up with the rest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>: I  agree entirely. It is easy for people at arm&rsquo;s length and in paid government  positions to make cuts in the areas that Fra McCann mentioned. It is easy for  them to say that that is the extra that we do not need and that we do not need  to get into all that social stuff, because we do. That is quite an easy way in  which to improve an area, and including those areas is quite an easy way in  which to improve them. It is important that families and kids in those areas  feel that they are included in society as a result of the peace dividend and  the Assembly. It is intolerable that NISRA figures prove that that is not  happening, and we must tackle that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I agree that that area should not be targeted,  because it is cheap to pay people who work at a community level. As many people  do an enormous amount of voluntary work, and others do an enormous amount of  work for very low pay, community services are not particularly costly. It could  be expensive to deliver similar services through government and the Civil Service.  Many people who work in the community sector have little pension provision, but  they still deliver a tremendous product at a low cost, compared with almost anything  else, to government. The private sector could not match it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From a DETI point of view, the elements of job creation and  growing the economy are also important. The Minister might say that I am simply  looking for fewer cuts and not providing the mature level of debate that is  required. I want a mature debate, and I am all for dealing with the issues and  making the tough decisions on how to increase the amount of money that comes  into our budgets, but I will not give way on job creation and the strategy for  growth over the next 10 years, because they are important. We must not resort  to making cuts and living in an increasingly downward situation for the next  number of years, because that will not get us anywhere. To get back to a proper  financial position, we will have to make savage cuts, but the lowering of the  standard of living in certain areas would not resolve the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although our aim is to reach a financially sustainable  position, it is important that the Minister realises that there are areas in  which it would be crazy to make cuts. The management of the entire Civil  Service and throughout government should be examined thoroughly, not just on  the surface. When it has been determined that everything is correct and in  place, we can consider other ways of increasing our budgets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We are at the end of a long and, as I said,  repetitive process, but it has been a valuable one. I appreciate all Members&rsquo;  contributions, particularly those made over the past week. I appreciate the  role that the Committee played in the process. Its members demonstrated that  they wanted to be constructive during the discussions, and the fact that they  agreed to accelerated passage helped the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note the Chairperson of the Committee&rsquo;s point that some  people had expressed concern that accelerated passage might mean a lack of  engagement, but that has not been the case. We have had three debates, without  time limits, on the Bill. Perhaps, as was a constant theme in a number of Members&rsquo;  contributions, the lack of engagement was at the stage at which Committees  should have been scrutinising their Departments&rsquo; proposals. It is sad that many  Departments and Ministers did not provide the information that they should have  provided. Even when information was provided, it was not always in a  sufficiently timely manner to allow for discussion. A number of Members,  including Mr McCann, raised that point. I hope that doing so will not get him  into trouble because, of course, when he criticised Ministers, he criticised  his party&rsquo;s Ministers, just as I criticised some Ministers in my party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I see that Mr McCann wants me to give way. Perhaps he wants  to dig himself into a deeper hole or to extract himself from that hole.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I cannot stand here and criticise the former Social Development Minister and  her Department for not providing the information that would have allowed the  Committee to have a proper debate without including all Ministers, because they  are probably all guilty.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am glad that the Member has clarified that he is  in a hole and that he is happy for his comments to apply to all Ministers. He  can rest content that he will sit on the Back Benches a while longer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is an important point and one that I have  indicated that I want addressed through the process that we will follow. I have  already laid out with the Committee a very strict timetable in which we want  Departments to bring forward spending plans, which we want an opportunity to  discuss with Ministers during August. In the autumn, there should be an  opportunity for Committees to talk to Ministers about those plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is only one part of the process. The other is the  debate that I hope that I have started today about how we can ensure that, even  if Ministers agree to co-operate and play ball in a way that many of them have  not been prepared to do so far, Assembly Members and Committees are equipped to  question their proposals. It is important that we look at the information  provided, the way that that is done, the breakdown of that information and how  it is presented, so that we can get to the point to which Mr McCann and others  have referred. We want to get to a point whereby, when a Minister says that he  that will reduce a certain part of his budget, Members know what that means for  programmes and projects in their constituencies. Mr McHugh made the same point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As that information is available, why should it not be made  available to Assembly Committees for scrutiny? It may make life more  uncomfortable for a Minister and his officials when he attends the Committee to  speak about budgetary proposals, but that is the only way in which the Assembly  can do its job. At a time when we are faced with constrained Budgets, that type  of information is essential because it allows Assembly Members to find out  whether money is being spent on things that it should not be spent on and  whether it could be spent on something different? Could matters be handled  better on a cross-departmental basis because we can see how they interlink?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I made a genuine appeal to the Assembly, and some Members  have responded; others may not have had time to think about it. Assembly  Members are the people who have to scrutinise departmental budgets, and I want  to know the kind of information and approach that Members and Committees  believe would be most appropriate in helping them to do their job. The outcome  may prove to be uncomfortable at times, but everyone should benefit from it,  especially at a time such as this. I suppose that we do not care too much about  how we spend money when we have stacks of it, but we need to be very careful  about how we spend it when we do not have as much. That is one of the things  that we will have to face in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me turn to another couple of points made by the  Chairperson of the Committee. Again, she raised the issue of social  procurement. In last week&rsquo;s debate, I outlined the kind of things that we have  built into procurement policy with respect to the long-term unemployed,  apprenticeships, etc. I accept that the scope is limited, but nevertheless it  is there. Departments have to seek to get best value for money when it comes to  procurement and, therefore, the more restrictions one puts into the procurement  process, the more difficult it is to achieve that particular objective. Also,  we all recognise that we must move away from dependence on the public sector.  We do not want to build a bias into the procurement process that reinforces the  bias towards the public sector in the economy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Does the Minister accept that,  when we talk about the social value of procurement, we are not necessarily  saying that economic value, or value for money, should not be measured as well?  If social clauses are included in the procurement policy, there will be better  economic effects in the longer term.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That conflict will not always exist. However,  sometimes it will, and we have to bear that in mind at a time when we are  trying to get best value for money. If we want to help people in poverty, the best  thing that we can do is to grow the economy and ensure that we provide  employment across the board. We need to grow the economy in all areas and be  aware of the skills that are available, as well as the lack of skills.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee also mentioned child  poverty. I emphasise that that is the responsibility of all Departments. It  should be part of their programmes, and there are targets that we will be  required to meet. Having proper detail of the budgets will enable Committees to  scrutinise and work out whether Departments are meeting those objectives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton raised the issue of the Budget process. I have  made clear what I believe the changes in the process should be for: they should  be designed to help the Assembly to do its job. I am sure that I will be given  plenty of ideas from his Committee and others as to what they believe is  essential to ensure that the Ministers and departmental officials that are  being scrutinised are held to account and required to give the greatest level  of detailed information on budgets. I look forward to his support on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must admit, I shared Mr McFarry&rsquo;s view of Mr McDevitt.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="BoldText">Dr Farry</span><span class="Italic">: &mdash;  [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister of Finance and  Personnel</span><span class="Italic">: </span>Sorry, Mr Farry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When Mr McDevitt started by saying that we need to look at  how we raise our money, I was looking forward to some juicy thinking on that  issue. At least he raised the point, although it was a bit disappointing how  that panned out. He immediately said no to water charges; that is the safe  option. He said that we need to look at the rating system, which has been  revised and is now based on capital values; it is just settling in. Mr McDevitt  did not develop the point, so I do not know whether he was suggesting that we  should try to re-revise and look at the whole rating system again, or that we  keep the current method, but seek to raise revenue through it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt said a lot of things. He asked whether we could  raise money through the rating system. I have pointed out to the Assembly  before that a full 1% increase in domestic and business rates would raise  around &pound;5&middot;8 million. He can see, as can others, that if we are simply relying  on the current rating system and increases in rates to raise the kind of money  that we are talking about, the required increase would be enormous and, of  course, would have a political impact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He was quite right to say that people like to know what  their money is going to be spent on. However, given the fact that the regional  rate simply goes into the pot, it would be a retrograde step to simply say that  rates will be raised only for certain items of expenditure, before sending  people nice glossy publications with pie charts stating that 10% of their rates  go on this, 10% on that, and 50% on the other.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not so difficult for councils, for which the main  source of revenue is the district rate. Councils know what their range of  services is and can say how they are divided, but it would be a bit difficult  for the Assembly to do that. Although we would like to have that transparency,  unless we were prepared to ring-fence rates for certain purposes, it would not  be technically possible to provide that information.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I fully acknowledge that there was a significant debate during the early part  of this mandate about rating. I am still deeply sceptical about whether the  system is fit for purpose in meeting our needs in the next decade. Given that  he is slightly better able to have a sense of confidence about the changes that  took place, how confident is the Minister that the changes made to the rating  system in the past couple of years will deliver the outcomes that we all  believe are needed? More particularly, how confident is the Minister that those  changes will deliver increased public confidence in our rating system? I take  his point about the regional rate, but most consumers do not separate them.  They just see the rates &mdash; in which their confidence remains low.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: If the question is how confident I am that the  rating system can be used as a source of revenue to overcome the financial  difficulties and fill the financial hole that we will face over the next few  years, the answer is that, for the reason that I have given, it cannot. It  would require huge increases in rates to enable us to raise the amount of money  that we will need. That is one of the reasons why I have emphasised that we  must make tough choices about what we do about our current spending patterns  and the way in which we deliver some services in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I understand and have put on record that I believe  that raising some more money from the public in Northern Ireland &mdash; whether  through charges, limited tax increases or services that we sell &mdash; has a role to  play, the scale of the problem is such that we are going to have to rely on  changes in the amount that we spend. However, the one thing that I am fairly  sure of is that we cannot look again at a radical change in the rating system.  We would be criticised for doing so. Charging for water through the rating  system, which seemed to be what the Member was suggesting, would create massive  difficulties, some of which have been fairly well rehearsed. The Member went on  to talk about asset leverage, but did not really develop the point. Those are  issues that we need to look at again in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt, Mr Fra McCann and Mr McHugh made the point  that we should be spending to fund needs rather than Departments. That is the  whole point of public spending. It should not be to sustain a system, structure  or whatever. It should be to provide things that the market does not and the  public purse, therefore, must. Once implemented, some of the changes that I  have recommended in the Budget process and sharing of information will,  hopefully, help Members to drill down to see exactly whether money is being  directed towards particular needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If sufficient detail is there, Members will be able to see  whether the way in which a Department spends its money changes as needs change,  or whether it is simply, as he suggested, for the benefit of the Department:  &ldquo;There has always been somebody who has done that job, we have always used  money in that way and really we do not want to change it so we just keep on  doing it.&rdquo; Having that degree of information should enable Members to make that  kind of judgement. Hopefully, that will be one of the benefits of the changes  that I have suggested, albeit that they may be a bit uncomfortable for  Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt raised Mike Smyth&rsquo;s idea of taxing text  messages. The one thing that I remember from my teaching days is that one of  Adam Smith&rsquo;s canons of taxation was that a tax should be collected cheaply. I  do not know the administrative cost involved in distinguishing between phone  calls and text messages.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As far as I know, my monthly mobile telephone bill  &mdash; Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise for going off on a tangent in the middle of  the debate &mdash; is a summation; it is not divided between text messages and phone  calls. Therefore, administratively, I do not know how that would work or,  indeed, whether it would be within the competence of a regional Assembly to  gather money in that way.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry spoke about North/South co-operation. I repeat:  although I have no political ambition for greater union between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,  I recognise the fact that, where there is a land boundary, services can be  provided more cheaply or there are other advantages, and it makes sense to  explore them. There is no constitutional point of contention; it is simply a  case of good economics. Therefore, ideas that come forward should be  considered. However, that is a job for individual Ministers; it does not need  to be done through expensive North/South structures. In fact, such co-operation  can sometimes be an impediment, because it introduces the suspicion that things  are being done for the wrong reasons. Sometimes, direct departmental or  ministerial contact might be a better way to achieve North/South co-operation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also raised the Health Minister&rsquo;s attitude towards  his Department&rsquo;s funding. When I spoke about whether the Assembly is fit to  look after the Budget, I had the Health Minister in mind. When someone is head of  the biggest-spending Department, it is the height of irresponsibility to don  the cloth cap, join the protesters against the cuts and then claim to be a  responsible Minister. Many members of the public would regard that behaviour  either as juvenile or the height of cynicism. All the studies indicate that  savings can be found in a budget as large as the health budget. The McKinsey  report into the health budget in England identified savings of 15%  to 22% over the next four years. Given that productivity in the Northern  Ireland Health Service is lower than that in other parts of the United Kingdom,  it must be possible to find at least that level of savings, if not more. If  such savings can be found, the opportunity to direct money towards providing  extra services will always be available. Therefore, people should not be afraid  to look for savings, because resources can then be released to provide more  services, and that benefits everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also raised the policing and justice budget,  which, of course, is not part of the Bill. Although the Executive agreed to  ring-fence the budget this year, I agree that that cannot be sustained. As time  moves on, we will have to consider all budgets in the round. In the future, the  Executive will face new challenges, so we must have total flexibility in how we  spend our money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann and others raised the matter of Ministers&rsquo;  engagement with their respective Committees. I repeat: as far as I am  concerned, Ministers should engage. I have done my best to force them to do so.  I have written to them, raised the matter at Executive meetings and named and  shamed them, no matter from which party they come, and I will persist in doing  that. However, it is up to Committees to insist that they be allowed to fulfil  their role, and Ministers who do not co-operate should be dealt with robustly  by the Committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann also raised the need to prioritise areas of  deprivation. I cannot remember whether he or someone else from his party raised  the issue during Question Time, but the way to address pockets of deprivation  across Northern Ireland  is to ensure that, through economic growth, we create employment opportunities  for all. That means doing two things. First, some people cannot access the  labour market at present because they do not have the skills or the education;  perhaps they have been institutionalised as far as unemployment is concerned.  We must address that, and the Department for Employment and Learning and the  Department for Social Development, through some of the welfare reforms, have  sought to do that. Secondly, once those people have the ability to access the  market, we have to make sure that we provide the opportunities for jobs to be  created. That is why one of the priorities in the Programme for Government was  the growth of the economy and small, medium and large firms. Does that mean  that we should direct employment towards areas of deprivation? It is not always  possible to do that. Perhaps Fra McCann will intervene at this point.  Sometimes, getting firms to look at Northern Ireland is all we can do,  rather than tell them to locate their business at the ends of certain streets.  The international market is now so competitive that one does not have the  ability, through grants, cajoling or whatever, to push people towards  particular locations. That may well mean that some people have to travel to  find opportunities, but that may not be such a bad idea as it may stop the kind  of ghettoisation that sometimes reinforces deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  In north and west Belfast,  the IDB has a very poor record of encouraging industry towards areas of high  social deprivation. One of the difficulties is that most of that deprivation is  ingrained; it has been there for generations. Besides work on the economy,  which is right, interventions need to be made to ensure that those who suffer  from poor health because of deprivation, poor housing and a wide range of other  factors are targeted. Resources are needed to take them out of that situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The record of the Executive in that regard has been  very good. Last year, we had the highest number of new social housing units  built for 15 or 20 years, and many of them were directed towards the areas  about which the Member talked. Ultimately, although we can provide programmes  to give people the skills to get them off benefits and into employment, it is  not possible &mdash; there is no point in pretending that it is &mdash; to ensure that we  can direct companies to set up in particular areas, especially in areas that  have a long history of terrorist activity. Sometimes, the image of the past  still lives with us as a legacy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will give way in a minute or two.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, businesses may not be happy to locate in a  certain area because of its crime rate. Perhaps the Member will have a go at  me, but I find it difficult to understand how some people say that they find it  impossible to travel a mile outside the area in which they live, into the city  centre or whatever, to take up employment opportunities. There is a level at  which we must cease to indulge people who come up with those arguments against  taking up employment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. He talked about people travelling. This is  not about travelling across other parts of Belfast; it is about not having jobs to  travel to. We are talking about equality of opportunity so that people can  access those jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has said that we cannot ask for investment in  particular areas, but Invest NI&rsquo;s corporate plan states that it tries to  encourage FDI to be located within a 10-mile radius of an area of disadvantage  and need. Does the Minister agree that a way around that would be to put that financial  investment into the social economy sector? We have talked about that, and we  have paid lip service to it. The social economy sector, in all areas of  disadvantage and need, creates employment opportunities for those who can  access them, and it regenerates communities.However, until now, only a small  proportion of money has gone into the social economy sector. Would that be a  way to lift those families and areas out of deprivation and need that the  Minister and his Executive colleagues would be prepared to look at as a way  forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The first thing to say is that the final decision  does not rest with me. Other Departments, including DSD and DETI, will make  those decisions. Secondly, although there are many examples of companies in the  social economy sector that do good and valuable work and contribute to what  goes on in their area &mdash; I can think of many in my constituency and many that I  have visited &mdash; those tend not to be very high-value jobs. One must bear in mind  the fact that we are trying to lift not just the number of jobs but the quality  of jobs and to give good opportunities to individuals. Thirdly, there are  limits to what can be done in the social economy. Although some of the  enterprises have been very inventive and have done good service to the local  economy, the point is that many of them are still dependent on the public  purse. There must be a reconfiguration of the economy. When enterprises lose  contracts or grants from the public sector or lose European money, they are in  difficulty. We all know that because we have heard the stories. The Member must  accept that there is a limit to what we can do through the social economy if we  are trying to rebalance the economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The last Member to speak was Mr McHugh, who talked about  the difficulty that increasing domestic bills would have on hard-pressed  households. That is one of the reasons why I have said that, if we are to raise  revenue, we must ensure that we have demonstrated to people that we have used  their money in the most effective way so far. That is a big challenge for the  Assembly. However, we cannot ignore the fact that there are two sides to the  equation: how we spend the money and the amount of money that we raise. There  must be a balance to that equation, as Mr Farry reminds me continually. The  issue is where that balance rests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will draw my remarks to a close. There are difficult days  ahead and difficult choices to be made, and that has been a recurrent theme in  these debates. The Chancellor will deliver his Budget tomorrow, but I do not  know whether it will give us a clear picture of where we will be with Budget  2010 and the CSR period to 2014 or 2015. It may well be a month or two before  we get the detail of the picture for Northern Ireland. I have noted the  genuine concerns of Members. They want to best serve the people whom they  represent, and they want to safeguard our public services. That is the goal  towards which we must all work. Of course, there will be differences of opinion  at times, but I hope that we will approach the issue responsibly. We should not  have the attitude of letting someone else take the tough decisions, which has,  unfortunately, been the approach taken by some parties over the current period.  They see a tough decision and decide to let the other parties vote it through  while they vote against it. If that is the way in which we conduct the process  over the next number of months and into the new Budget period, we will not be  serving the people of Northern    Ireland very well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we vote on the Final Stage of the third Budget Bill of  this session, I ask for Members&rsquo; support to vote those resources in cash to  enable the continuation of services throughout the remainder of 2011. I commend  the Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that the vote  on the motion requires cross-community support.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="B1SpeakersNameChar"><span style="font-size:10.5pt; ">Mr  Deputy Speaker:</span></span> <span class="B1SpeakersNameChar"><span style="font-size:10.5pt; ">The next five items of business are motions to approve  Statutory Rules.</span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Pensions Regulator Tribunal (Transfer of Functions)  (2010 Act) (Consequential Provisions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In advance of outlining what the Order will achieve, I want  to thank the Business Committee for tabling these five items en bloc this  afternoon and the Committee for Social Development for considering these  matters during its recent meetings. Some of the proposals are technical in  nature but necessary; some are about setting new rates and are essential; and  some represent significant adjustments to the regimes that currently exist in  the North. As with the Welfare Reform Bill, which had its Consideration Stage  last week and will have its Final Stage next week, the proposals before the  House today deal with matters of parity. We have had that debate before, and I  am sure we will have it again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Pensions Regulator Tribunal was an independent appeal  tribunal established to hear appeals against determinations of the Pensions  Regulator, such as the imposition of financial penalties, suspension or  prohibition of a trustee, a contribution notice or a winding-up order. Unlike  the appeal bodies for social security, the Pensions Regulator Tribunal operated  on an UK-wide basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Lord Chancellor, by way of a transfer Order made under  the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, transferred the functions and  members of the Pensions Regulator Tribunal to the new unified Tribunals Service  with effect from 6 April 2010, and from that date the Pensions Regulator  Tribunal structure ceased to exist. However, the Lord Chancellor did not have  the power to affect the transfer of the tribunal&rsquo;s functions in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The functions of the Pensions Regulator Tribunal in Northern Ireland were transferred to the new  Tribunals Service structure under the Pensions Regulator Tribunal (Transfer of  Functions) Act (Northern Ireland)  2010 simultaneously with the transfer of the same functions in England, Scotland  and Wales,  which ensured that the right of an independent appeal tribunal was maintained  for people here. Section 2 of that Act provides for the Department to make  consequential amendments, repeals or modifications to any statutory provision  for the purposes of giving full effect to the transfer of the functions of the  Pensions Regulator Tribunal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This Order does not make any policy changes. It merely  makes minor technical consequential amendments to UK-wide provisions, in line  with corresponding amendments made by the Lord Chancellor for England, Scotland  and Wales  to give full effect to the transfer of the Pensions Regulator Tribunal  functions to the new Tribunals Service structure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development considered the Pensions Regulator Tribunal (Transfer of  Functions) (2010 Act) (Consequential Provisions) Order (Northern Ireland)  2010 during its meetings of 4 March 2010 and 25 March 2010. Prior to that, the  Committee had considered the related 2010 Act, which was subject to accelerated  passage through the Assembly. As the Minister has indicated, the related  primary legislation transferred the functions of the Pensions Regulator  Tribunal in Northern Ireland  to the Tribunals Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was satisfied that the transfer will have  minimum adverse impact on the services that were previously provided by the  Pensions Regulator Tribunal in Northern    Ireland. Most Committee members welcomed the  fact that the Order will continue the long-standing principle of parity between  Northern Ireland and the  rest of the United Kingdom  in pensions matters. Consequently, the Committee agreed that it would recommend  that the statutory rule be confirmed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am sure that the Minister and  Committee members will be pleased to learn that Sinn F&eacute;in voted for the  statutory rule; that can be checked in the Committee minutes and in Hansard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been stated, the statutory rule unifies the appeals  system. As far as I am aware, an appeal never went to the Pensions Regulator in  the North, so it was not used widely anyway. The legislation will benefit  people here in that they will continue to have the right to an independent  tribunal on their pensions. On behalf of my party, I agree with that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Hamilton and Mr Brady for their support, and  I thank the House and the Committee for their consensus in support of the  legislation. I have only one comment to make, and I am not saying that it will  be relevant at all. The issues of pensions and pensions regulation are vital,  and they become more vital during an economic recession when there may be  pressure on pension funds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency there continue to be major issues around  the pension entitlements of Visteon workers, a matter that is under  investigation in Britain  by the appropriate authorities. I am not saying that that matter will come  across the desk of the tribunal here, but it captures the importance of the  proper regulation of pensions and of the proper conduct of those responsible  for the management of pensions, including trustees. Therefore, as Mr Brady  said, an appeal does not arise often, but it is vital that we have the power to  regulate the structure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that Members recognised the importance of the  technical and consequential amendments that the Order makes to give full effect  to the transfer of functions. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Notice taken that 10 Members were not present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">House counted, and there being fewer than 10 Members  present, the Deputy Speaker ordered the Division Bells to be rung.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Now we may proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Pensions Regulator Tribunal (Transfer of  Functions) (2010 Act) (Consequential Provisions) Order (Northern Ireland)  2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="15"></a>Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order (Northern Ireland)  2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order (Northern Ireland)  2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Order certainly has the potential to invite a little  bit more controversy, and it very much impacts upon the lives and welfare of  people in the North. It is an annual Order that sets out the rates of  contributory and non-contributory benefits, together with the various premiums  that form part of income-related benefits. In general, the amounts are based on  changes to the relevant price indicators over the 12 months ending in  September.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Income-related benefits are increased in the usual way by  the Rossi index, which is the retail prices index (RPI) less housing costs.  That index is used because housing costs are usually met separately from those  benefits. For example, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, employment and support allowance  and incapacity benefit are increased by 1&middot;8% this year. Members will be aware  that it is usual to increase the state pension and most social security  benefits in line with the retail prices index. However, in September 2009, the  retail prices index showed negative growth of -1&middot;4%. In order to uprate a  number of benefits that normally increase in line with the RPI, a proportion of  next year&rsquo;s expected increase has been brought forward. For example, certain  benefits, such as carer&rsquo;s allowance, attendance allowance, disability living  allowance and the severe disability premium in income-related benefits, are  increased by 1&middot;5% this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The basic state pension, which for many is the foundation  of income in retirement, is increased by 2&middot;5% in line with the commitment that  was given at Westminster.  That means that, this year, the basic state pension for a single person is  increased by &pound;2&middot;40 a week to &pound;97&middot;65 and that the standard rate based on a  spouse&rsquo;s or civil partner&rsquo;s contribution is increased to &pound;58&middot;50. That gives a  pensioner couple a total of &pound;156&middot;15 a week. Increases in pension credit mean  that no single pensioner will live on less than &pound;132&middot;60 and that no couple will  live on less than &pound;202&middot;40 a week. The above-earnings increase in the pension  credit guarantee underlines our commitment to tackling pensioner poverty. I am  sure that Members will welcome those increases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The total cost of the new benefit rates for this year is  approximately &pound;46&middot;3 million. I hope that all Members will wish to ensure that  people in Northern Ireland,  including some of the most vulnerable in our society, can continue to receive  those new rates of benefit, and I hope that they will join me in supporting the  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development considered the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order (Northern Ireland)  2010 at its meetings on 18 February 2010 and 25 March 2010. As the Minister  said, the Order is part of the annual cycle of statutory rules, which, in this  case, uprates benefits in line with inflation generally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The uprating of benefits is usually a simple matter of  measuring inflation and increasing payments accordingly. In this case, as  inflation was less than 0% for the measurement period, the Department for Work  and Pensions chose to adopt a different approach. I am pleased to report the  Committee&rsquo;s approval for the fact that, for certain benefits, the decision was  taken to anticipate some expected increases from next year. Consequently,  carer&rsquo;s allowance, attendance allowance, disability living allowance and the  severe disability premium were increased by 1&middot;5%. The Committee was also  pleased to note that the basic state pension and some other benefits increased  by 2&middot;5%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the House is aware, the majority of Committee members  support the maintenance of parity of social security, pensions and child  maintenance matters with the rest of the United Kingdom. Our adherence to  the principle of parity sometimes means that the House must adopt unwelcome  welfare provisions. In this case, with the exception of the reduction of  incapacity benefit age additions, for example, the measures in this statutory  rule are generally very welcome. Therefore, the Committee was happy to  recommend that the Assembly confirm the rule.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It is essential that benefits are  uprated annually. The problem is that people are still being left to live on  subsistence level, and, although there is an increase in state pension, we  still have the meanest pension scheme in the entire developed world.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is no great solace to people who are expected  to live on it, if we consider that couples in receipt of pensions, as well as  pension credit, are left to live on &pound;202&middot;40 a week, considering fuel,  electricity and transport costs, which are much higher here than in Britain.  That puts things into perspective. However, if those benefits are not uprated,  people will suffer. Therefore, I support the uprating. Sinn F&eacute;in Committee  members voted in favour of the statutory rule.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Committee and the House for their consensus  in support of the Order. I do not think that anybody will disagree with the  sentiment that was expressed by Mr Brady &mdash; whatever our issues might be on  parity and social security &mdash; that proper and adequate income for vulnerable  people, including pensioners, whose only source of income in many instances is  their pension, is something that we all sympathise with. If we compare social  security rates in this part of Ireland  with the Republic   of Ireland, we can see  how the differentials have grown over recent years. However, there needs to be  a health warning, because we may be comparing apples with oranges, given that  the costs in the Republic   of Ireland on many of the  indices are higher than they are in the North. Therefore, the differential  between pensions in the North and the South are not what they might appear at  face value.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we have a lot further to travel in respect of  pensions, pensioners&rsquo; incomes rose by about 29% in real terms between 1996-97  and 2005-06. That is not a reason for complacency, but, to some degree, a path  has been travelled in recent times in respect of addressing historically low  pension rates for those who have served our society so well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order (Northern Ireland)  2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="16"></a>Mesothelioma Lump Sum Payments (Conditions and Amounts  (Amendment) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Mesothelioma Lump Sum Payments (Conditions  and Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations are made under the Mesothelioma, etc., Act  (Northern Ireland)  2008, and increase the compensation payable under the Act to persons who are  diagnosed with that diffuse condition, or, if the person has died, to their  dependants. The increases in the amount payable under the Act maintain parity  with the corresponding scheme in Britain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline briefly the purpose of the scheme. The  scheme provides financial support within a matter of weeks, without the need to  establish an occupational link or any causal link. Many people who previously  were not eligible for help &mdash; for example, those who were unable to pursue a  civil claim or to claim a lump sum under other legislation &mdash; will, for the  first time, have access to financial help for this terrible disease. That means  that sufferers are eligible for a payment whether they are employees,  self-employed, or, indeed, have never worked, provided that they have not  already received a compensation payment from another source.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Act provides for lump sum payments made under the  scheme and the 1979 scheme to be recoverable from subsequent civil  compensation. The scheme payments are set so that the overall expenditure is  estimated to match the recoveries from civil compensation. In light of that, when  the scheme was introduced in 2008, the lump sum payments were set at a lower  level than those under the 1979 scheme &mdash; the intention being that payments  under the scheme would be increased over time to the same level as those under  the 1979 scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In line with this year&rsquo;s uprating of industrial injuries  benefits, the Assembly agreed, on 22 March, regulations to increase the amounts  payable under the 1979 scheme by 1&middot;5%. In addition, to reduce the differential  in the amounts payable to sufferers and dependants, the regulations increased  the amounts payable to dependants under the 1979 scheme by up to &pound;5,000. That  was widely supported across the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations that we are considering today increase the  amounts payable under the scheme to sufferers and dependants up to the level of  those payable under the 1979 scheme from April 2010. That is in line with the  commitment given by my predecessor, Margaret Ritchie, during the passage of the  Bill to provide even greater help to sufferers of this terrible disease at the  earliest opportunity. Therefore, the amount payable to a person aged 37 or  under at diagnosis, for example, will be increased from &pound;52,772 to &pound;75,176.  That is an increase of &pound;22,404 or 42%. I am sure that Members across the  Assembly will warmly welcome that uplift in payments to the level of the 1979  scheme, particularly the significant increase in the amounts payable to  dependants only 18 months after the introduction of the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development considered the Department&rsquo;s proposal to make the  Mesothelioma Lump Sum (Conditions and Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2010 at its meeting on 18 February 2010 and considered the statutory rule at  its meeting on 15 April.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the House has heard from the Minister, the rule  increases the payments to sufferers and their dependants. Although no amount of  money can compensate for the misery and suffering caused by such diseases, the  amounts payable offer some assistance to sufferers and their dependants. As the  rule provides more money for those people, the Committee for Social Development  is happy to recommend that the statutory rule be confirmed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I want to say &ldquo;mesothelioma&rdquo; early in  my contribution and get it out of the way. The Committee has had a lot more  practice saying it than the Minister has had, because we have discussed it over  a period of time. Mesothelioma is a terminal condition. Most sufferers are,  unfortunately, dead within six months of their diagnosis. The regulation is to  be welcomed, because it makes access to compensation easier for the sufferers  and their dependants, among whom will be the victims&rsquo; wives, for instance, who  will have been involved in washing clothes that were contaminated by asbestos,  etc, which is the cause of mesothelioma. The regulation is to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the benefit and thank the Minister for bringing it forward again this  year. I hope that the people who suffer from the awful illness will get some  comfort from the benefit. I think that everyone in the Chamber will know  families &mdash; parents and children alike &mdash; who are affected by mesothelioma. It is  a very severe illness. I hope that those families can get some comfort from  this regulation, and I thank the Minister for bringing it forward again.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I support the motion. I am sure that most Members have constituents who suffer  from the disease. It is a most distressing and disabling condition and one for  which, we must remember, there is no cure. The cause is most likely to be  exposure to asbestos, with 90% of cases being asbestos-related. Sufferers and  their families are in need of special consideration due to extra expenses that  they have as a result of the disease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A sad fact of the disease is that it is rarely caught at an  early stage. Therefore, it is only when the condition becomes advanced that a  diagnosis can be made. I note that some of the outlay will be recovered from  compensation awards, so that will, hopefully, lessen the impact on departmental  budgets. That will also help to fund the scheme in the long term. I believe  that the lump sum is to be a payment instead of, or in advance of, compensation.  I support this crucial motion, and I have great pleasure in doing so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Those four contributions captured the importance of the  issue. As Mrs Bradley and others indicated, Members will have heard in their  offices about individuals who have the condition and the acute situations that  they are in as a consequence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Mesothelioma, etc., Act (Northern Ireland)  2008 provided for a scheme to break the link with workplace exposure to  asbestos and provided upfront financial support to those people who have not  already received compensation in connection with the disease. That is an  important principle, and we can see the outworkings of it. As Members said, it  concerns not only about the person who contracted the disease at work, because  it could affect the spouse of that person. There has been more than one case in  which the disease was passed to the children in the family. Therefore, it is a  devastating disease that has immediate and serious consequences and crosses  generations within families. The regulation is particularly useful, because,  among other things, it reviews the rates of compensation, and those will be  reviewed annually hereafter. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Mesothelioma Lump Sum Payments (Conditions  and Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="17"></a>Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Automatic  Enrolment) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes  (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my judgement, this is an important set of regulations.  Given the situation across the social security framework and the potential for  changes and adjustments to that, allied to the fact that some people are  calling for a review of pensions, pension entitlements, pension payments, and  so on, it is important to create a level of stability in the management of  pensions. That applies particularly to those who, historically, may not have  had access to pensions, may not have been offered pensions or may have been  denied pensions. It is important to create some certainty in the system for  people in such situations. That is why I ask that the Occupational and Personal  Pension Schemes (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Pensions (No.2) Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 and the  corresponding provision in the Westminster Pensions Act 2008 introduced a duty  on employers to enrol eligible jobholders on a qualifying workplace pension  scheme and to make minimum contributions to that scheme. Under the legislation,  employers will be able to choose the qualifying workplace pension scheme that  they adopt to discharge that duty. A qualifying scheme is one that meets  specific criteria, such as occupational pension schemes, including the National  Employment Savings Trust (NEST) that was established on a UK-wide basis under  the Pensions Act 2008, or a workplace personal pension scheme. In enacting the  Pensions (No.2) Act (Northern    Ireland) 2008, the House has already agreed  the policy of automatic enrolment. Although the 2008 Act set out the framework  underpinning the automatic enrolment requirements, the detail is set out in the  regulations that are before the House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may be helpful to explain briefly that no one will be  forced into workplace pension saving; everyone will be free to opt out, should  they so wish. However, the intention is to make it as easy as possible for  those who choose to opt out and those for whom automatic enrolment is not  appropriate at a particular time to enter pension saving when the time is right  and to ensure that the processes by which they can do so are simple. Equally,  it is important for individuals to have confidence in the continuity of pension  provision. The aim is to allow as many existing schemes as possible to meet the  required standard, thereby making it easy for employers who already have good  schemes in place to meet the requirements and to protect good, existing  provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The intention is to make it as simple as possible for the  pension industry to provide schemes of sufficient quality and to keep a level  playing field between schemes. The new automatic enrolment regulations, which  form part of a comprehensive package of regulations, set out the practical  arrangements underpinning the Pensions (No.2) Act (Northern Ireland) 2008. In  particular, they outline the process for employers to achieve active membership  for jobholders and the time limits that apply; the information flow that is  required between employers, pension schemes and jobholders; the process and  arrangements that apply when a jobholder chooses to opt out of pension saving;  the arrangements and time limits by which the employer must re-enrol eligible  jobholders who opted out or left pension saving; the arrangements by which  jobholders or workers who are not eligible for automatic enrolment can  voluntarily opt in to pension saving; and additional scheme quality  requirements for certain schemes whose main administration is outside Britain  and Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Automatic enrolment is being introduced in stages. New  employers established after October 2012 will have a bit more breathing space  to prepare for the duties, and will be staged between March and September 2016.  The automatic enrolment regulations set out arrangements for employers who  already operate a higher-quality scheme to postpone automatic enrolment for  three months if they so wish. They also outline the arrangements and time  limits by which the employer has to re-enrol eligible jobholders who have opted  out of, or left, pension saving.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations also amend two other sets of regulations to  extend the due date by which an employer must pay over employee contributions  deducted from earnings to a pension scheme and to specify how the Pensions  Regulator can determine that both employer and worker contributions are overdue  for the purposes of issuing an unpaid contributions notice. We are aware of the  problems posed by the aging demographic and likely constraints on public  spending in the years ahead. Many people are currently not saving enough to  deliver the pension income they are likely to want or expect on retirement.  Under the reforms, for the first time, many people will have access to a  private pension scheme and will have their own contributions boosted by  contributions from their employer and from the state through tax relief.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development considered the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes  (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 at its  meetings on 4 March and 22 April. The Committee has spent quite a lot of time  considering the new occupational pension scheme arrangements. Although the  Committee welcomes a new opportunity for the low-paid to save for their  retirement, members are concerned about how some of the set-up costs of the  National Employment Savings Trust scheme will have to be borne by savers on low  to medium earnings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have also taken some time to consider how the new  requirement for all employers to provide work-based pension schemes will  actually be implemented. It is anticipated that, as these new and welcome  measures are brought forward, the Committee will be hearing more from all  stakeholders on how they are actually being delivered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations in question provide welcome guidance on  automatic enrolment and opting out for occupational pension schemes. The  regulations also set out rules in respect of the payment of employee pension  contributions. As I have indicated, the Committee welcomes the prospect of a  work-based pension option for everyone. That said, the Committee does not  underestimate the challenge for employers or for those charged with  implementing the new retirement savings option. The Committee believes that the  regulations provide necessary guidance and rules for employees and employers.  Despite the reservations that I have identified, the Committee is content to  recommend that the rule be confirmed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I agree with what the Chairperson of  the Committee has said in relation to the regulation. The important thing is  that it gives people who would previously not have had the opportunity to go  into an occupational pension scheme that opportunity, particularly people who  are on low pay. I agree with the regulation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I welcome the endorsement of the Committee, the Members  who spoke and the House.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Question put and agreed to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes  (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="18"></a>Social Security (Contributions Credits for Parents and  Carers) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Social Security (Contributions Credits for  Parents and Carers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose by this stage the Business Committee is beginning  to wonder whether it was wise to table all of these motions at the one time.  This is the final regulation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 introduced a  new class 3 national insurance credit for parents and carers. The regulations  are necessary to give full effect to the new credit and to provide the detailed  provisions that enable the credit to be awarded. In part, they are the  outworking of a childcare strategy not just in Britain  but in Northern Ireland  to help people in that particular situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new carer&rsquo;s credit replaces and builds on the existing  home responsibilities protection provisions that help carers to qualify for the  basic state pension and bereavement benefits. The new credit will ensure that  caring counts for state pension and bereavement benefit purposes by crediting  the parent or carer with class 3 contributions for each week that they are  engaged in caring. A full year spent caring will provide one qualifying year  towards basic state pension entitlement. Additionally, part years spent  parenting or caring can be combined with a period spent working and earning in  the same year to make it a qualifying year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Act provides that a class 3 contribution will be  credited for each week in which a person is awarded child benefit for a child  under 12, is an approved foster parent or is engaged in caring as defined in  the regulations. The regulations define a person engaged in caring in four  different categories, and, if Members wish me to do so, I will place that  information in the Library. The contributions will also be available for a  12-week run-on in circumstances where care ceases, for example, due to the  permanent admission to residential care of the person being cared for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations also set out the application and  certification process and the time limits within which applications must be  made. The range of people who are able to certify the need for care is designed  to be as broad as possible. Foster parents, the partner of a person in receipt  of child benefit and people caring for 20 hours or more a week will be required  to complete an application form. Together with other pension reforms, such as  the reduction in the number of qualifying years that a person needs to get a  basic state pension and the introduction of a single contribution condition  that will enable a person to build up entitlement based on credits only, the  regulations form part of a package of beneficial measures that will enable  people who take time out of work to provide care to build up entitlement to a  state pension.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development considered the Social Security (Contributions Credits for  Parents and Carers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 at its  meetings on 25 February and 15 March. The Committee was pleased to consider the  regulations, which, as has been indicated, introduce credits for carers and  parents to ensure that time spent caring will count towards eligibility for a  state pension and bereavement benefits. As I indicated earlier, maintaining  parity with the rest of the United    Kingdom in respect of welfare provision can  often be challenging. The majority of the House will agree that the social  security and pension benefits that we have heard about today go some way to  justifying the position taken by most Members on the issue of parity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee noted that the Department had undertaken some  publicity in relation to the credits, and members trust that that has generated  interest in them and in the uptake of related benefits for carers. The Social  Development Committee and other Committees have spent some time considering how  best to improve the lot of carers, who do a great deal of work for often little  reward. Consequently, given that the regulations are expected to be beneficial  and will contribute to the process of giving recognition to carers, the  Committee is pleased to recommend that they be confirmed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The regulations are beneficial to  parents with young children and to carers as they give them the opportunity to  access state pensions eventually. I hope that Members have noticed that I have  not used the word &ldquo;parity&rdquo; once today. We have all agreed today on legislation  that is beneficial to people. However, I feel that it is our duty as members of  the Committee for Social Development to oppose legislation that is prescriptive  and not beneficial to people and to try to make that better. I just wished to  make that point.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I wish to speak on the regulations that the Social Development Committee  agreed, in February of this year, should become statutory rules. It is  important to recognise the role and service of parents and carers in Northern Ireland  in this way. Under section 23A of the Social Security Contributions and  Benefits Act 1992, the regulation provides the definition of those involved in  caring. Importantly, part 2 of the regulations provides a definition of &ldquo;foster  parent&rdquo; and &ldquo;engaged in caring&rdquo; for the purpose of section 23A.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I draw attention to regulation 5, which provides that  credits will be awarded to a person who provides 20 hours&rsquo; care each week for  an individual who receives disability benefit and to those people receiving  income support who care for a sick or disabled person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Regulation 7 allows for a person who is caring for an  individual still to be considered as engaged in caring during periods of  sickness, respite care and holidays of up to 12 weeks. I am pleased that the  Bill recognises and allows for those periods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also pleased that, in the framework of the Bill,  caring will act towards qualifying years for pension credits. That flexibility  is to be welcomed. Therefore, I am pleased that, under section 23 of the 1992  Act, a class 3 contribution will be credited for each week in which a person is  either awarded child benefit for a child under the age of 12, is an approved  foster parent or is engaged in caring.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome regulation 12, which specifies that the time  limit for making an application will be the end of the tax year following the  tax year that is the subject of the application.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I again thank the Members who spoke in the debate and  the House and the Committee for their endorsement of the regulations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to confirm what was said by the Chairperson of the  Committee for Social Development. In 2009, a communications campaign commenced  on the main state pension reforms, and that went live in April 2010. The new  carer credits were one of the reforms that were part of that communications  activity. My predecessor, Margaret Ritchie, wrote to all MPs, MLAs and  councillors to raise awareness of the reform package. Details of that package,  and of this measure in particular, can be found on the NI Direct website.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with Mr Brady. What he said need not detain us  now, but it will come up next week during the Final Stage of the Welfare Reform  Bill. However, even in the past few days, I have met officials and others to  identify whether there are ways and means, operationally, by which we can  assist people in need in the North without prejudicing the Assembly when it  comes to parity. I do not want to be prescriptive. Operationally, I want to be  as flexible as I can be, but in a way that does not do damage to people in need  in the North. We will take the benefits when they come, and, where they exist,  exploit the opportunities not to be prescriptive. That is the principle by  which I work. Therefore, I have absolute sympathy with Mr Brady&rsquo;s position. I  commend the motion to the House.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received several briefings, during which  members raised a number of issues. Overall, the Committee was generally  satisfied with the briefings and the clarification provided by the Department.  However, the Committee&rsquo;s work programme is heavily committed, and it has had to  prioritise its business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the current economic climate, it was considered  important and timely to press ahead with an investigation into efficiency  savings in the public sector. The House will debate the Committee&rsquo;s report on  that issue in a few moments. Also, in view of the forthcoming Budget 2010  process, which is likely to come to the Assembly and its Committees in the  autumn, the Committee considered it essential to aim to complete the next stage  of its Budget scrutiny inquiry in advance of the summer recess.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has liaised with the Department of Finance  and Personnel, which has confirmed that it is content with the proposal to  extend the Committee Stage to 26 November 2010. I assure the House that the  Committee will endeavour to complete its work well in advance of that date, and  I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the  period referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 26 November 2010, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Construction Contracts (Amendment) Bill  [NIA Bill 16/09].</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="21"></a>Preliminary Inquiry into Public Sector Efficiencies</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 15 minutes in which to propose  the motion and 15 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly approves the report of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel on its preliminary inquiry into public  sector efficiencies; and calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel, in  conjunction with Executive colleagues, to implement, as applicable, the  recommendations contained therein.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the  Committee and the Committee Clerks for the detailed report that we are debating  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to debate the Committee&rsquo;s report  on its inquiry into public sector efficiencies. At all times, governments  should be examining ways to make the most efficient and effective use of public  funds. Given the increasing pressure on Departments to deliver more with less  money, the report is timely and makes a positive contribution to the debate on  how our public sector can meet the challenge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee decided to undertake the inquiry at its  meeting on 14 October 2009. As part of its role to scrutinise strategic public  issues, the Committee agreed to examine the efficiency programme for  Departments with a focus on how savings can be maximised without affecting  priority front line services. Committee members also agreed to seek advice from  expert witnesses on a range of matters. Such matters included the nature and  definition of efficiency savings and how they differ from other savings and  budgetary measures; approaches to measuring and reporting on efficiencies,  including possible improvements to departmental efficiency delivery plans;  advice to Assembly Statutory Committees on the scrutiny of departmental  efficiencies; and opportunities for realising further savings in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the preliminary inquiry was to help to  establish a framework for examining the efficiency agenda locally, inform  approaches to indentifying further savings and monitor departmental delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once the quantum of the savings required becomes clear, it  will be for the Executive and Departments to identify the areas of spending  where they can be realised; it will be for the Assembly and its Committees to  scrutinise delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To inform its work, the Committee received evidence from  expert witnesses with experience in efficiency programmes locally and in other  jurisdictions. Oral evidence was received from Victor Hewitt, director of the  Economic Research Institute; Kieran Donnelly, Comptroller and Auditor General,  and other senior Audit Office officials; and Professor Colin Talbot of Manchester Business  School, University of Manchester,  who was a special adviser to the House of Commons Treasury Committee in its  recent inquiry evaluating the efficiency programme. Written submissions were  received from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and  from Professor Arthur Midwinter, who has undertaken major studies of local  government finance and devolution finance and who was recently a Budget adviser  to the Finance Committee of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having concluded its inquiry and in bringing forward these  recommendations, the Committee in no way underestimates the scale of the  challenge facing the Executive as they seek to deliver the recently announced  savings and to tackle further budgetary reductions for 2011-14. The Committee  has acknowledged the fact that Departments have been striving to achieve efficiencies  of between 2% and 3% over each of the past six years. Extra pressure will be  put on Departments by the Westminster Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are various predictions about the quantum of  additional savings that will be required of Departments here during 2011-14,  ranging from &pound;150 million to &pound;300 million a year. The Committee recognises that  the scale and immediacy of public expenditure pressures means that efficiency  gains alone are unlikely to be sufficient and that straightforward budgetary  savings will also be required. The Committee believes that those savings can  and should be achieved without having an adverse impact on essential public  services and strategic policy priorities. The existing annual budget baselines  for Departments total more than &pound;9 billion in current expenditure and about  &pound;1&middot;4 billion in capital expenditure. No one can reasonably claim that that  funding is being utilised completely efficiently or that there is no waste in  the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of important themes emerged from the inquiry,  including the need for clarity and consistency in what is meant by efficiency  savings; the need for transparency in how savings are achieved and applied; the  need for a strategic approach to targeting the areas where real efficiencies  can be realised, to prioritising the services and policies that must not be  affected adversely, and ensuring that the savings being claimed at a  departmental level are not counterproductive to the efficiency of the wider  public sector; and the need for a systematic approach to verifying and  monitoring the achievement of efficiencies. All of us need to be clear about  the difference between straightforward budget cuts and valid efficiency gains  and the implications of both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is of the view that for Departments to plan,  deliver and monitor efficiency savings effectively and for proper scrutiny by  the Assembly through its Committees, the Department of Finance and Personnel  (DFP) should set down a formal, central definition of what is meant by  efficiency savings. The lack of consistency and transparency in that area risks  confusion in the public sector, and controversy in the political and public  domain with regard to a rationale and outworking of the efficiency programme.  In addition, without a clear audit trail it is impossible to gain any assurance  that the savings deducted from Departments&rsquo; budgets have been allocated to key  front line services and Programme for Government priorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Money saving initiatives should be more than just cuts to  the quality or level of important public services; the impact of those savings  must also be visible in a way that can be clearly understood by the Assembly  and wider public. That is why the Committee has recommended that the Executive  develop a co-ordinated strategy to protect essential front line services and  strategic policy priorities and avoid the crude salami slicing of departmental  budgets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In developing the strategy, Executive Ministers should  undertake a fair assessment of spending programmes to identify those that have  not achieved or are no longer fulfilling their intended purpose and those that  are the lowest priority and, therefore, offer scope for savings that can be  allocated elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is also the advice of the Audit Office, which in  conjunction with its counterparts in Scotland  and Wales,  recently published a good practice efficiency checklist. It sets out the key  elements to securing greater efficiency and productivity, including the  adoption of a priority-based approach to budgeting and spending. The Audit  Office has also advised that there will be a need to segregate policies and  services into three categories: those that are absolutely essential to  delivering agreed outcomes and are already being delivered as efficiently and  effectively as possible; those that should continue but need to be redesigned  or reshaped to deliver them more efficiently and effectively; and those that  could stop without significantly affecting public services and outcomes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government is due to expire in the  current financial year. It is vital that the Executive review it urgently and  set out clearly the services and policies that should receive the highest  priority during the upcoming period of further budgetary savings and efficiency  gains. Following the requirement to achieve 3% efficiency savings in the Budget  period 2008-2011, DFP issued guidance for the development of departmental  efficiency delivery plans. Professor Arthur Midwinter considered that guidance  and stated in a written submission to the Committee:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Guidance Paper on Efficiency Delivery Plans  (EDPs) is mostly concerned with inputs &ndash; how financial savings will be  delivered and monitored. Whilst there is reference to impact on services and  the need &lsquo;to provide evidence there has not been a detrimental impact on  services to the public&rsquo; &hellip; this is not a systematic approach.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He went on to say that, in the main, the approach reports  economies and not efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Midwinter also considered the responses to a  series of Assembly questions, which asked each Executive Minister what services  in their respective Departments had been affected by efficiency savings in the  2008-09 financial year and in the first six months of the 2009-2010 financial  year. He concluded that the responses were not fit for purpose and did not  facilitate robust scrutiny of current practice. Professor Talbot also  considered the responses to the Assembly questions and told the Committee that  he thought that there was a certain amount of laxity around the definitions and  descriptions of efficiency savings. He also told members that he saw little  evidence in the responses of any Department measuring any aspect of service  delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While gathering its evidence, the Committee learned that,  across the 11 Departments, more than 80 efficiency delivery plans are published  on departmental websites, with varying levels of detail provided. Therefore, it  is with some urgency that the Committee calls on the Department of Finance and  Personnel to facilitate a process whereby a single efficiency delivery plan for  each Department is published in a central location to allow effective  monitoring of the plans centrally by DFP and by the Assembly&rsquo;s Statutory  Committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The role that Assembly Committees have to play in  scrutinising the efficiency delivery plans for their respective Departments  cannot be emphasised enough. The Committee heard much practical advice from the  expert witnesses that could assist in that regard. Professor Talbot stressed  that Committees must act as counterbalancing forces that put pressure on  Departments to deliver effectively and efficiently. He told the Committee:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If no such countervailing forces exist, the services  tend to go their own merry way&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">and</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;are operated in the interests of the people who run  them, rather than in the interests of those to whom they deliver services.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could go on to discuss the need to embed a culture of  efficient delivery into the routine responsibilities of public sector managers  or the additional efficiencies that can be achieved through further use of  shared services, better management of government accommodation and assets and  more collaborative procurement. However, I will allow others to explore those  matters in more detail during the debate. I look forward to hearing Members&rsquo;  contributions. I commend the report to the House.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The term &ldquo;efficiencies&rdquo; has characterised discussions about budgets and  spending since the restoration of devolution in 2007. It is not new, unique or  novel; it has been focused on for some time, and we should note this  Executive&rsquo;s achievement in realising 3% savings, equating to nearly &pound;1 billion.  Even though we are told that that has happened, and I accept that it has and  that it should be welcomed, it is very difficult for us as individual Members  to put our finger on exactly where that has been achieved and the quality of  the achievement of it, to the point where many who hear the term &ldquo;efficiencies&rdquo;  believe that it is a euphemism for cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A basic first principle is that we all support the idea of  efficiencies. When I talk about efficiencies, what I mean is certainly not  cuts, and definitely not cuts to front line services. Sometimes cutting  projects or programmes that are not delivering or have delivered is no bad  thing. However, when we talk about efficiencies, we are not talking about  cutting front line services. We are talking about doing more with less or  spending money upfront to allow savings in the longer term. That is what most  of us mean when we talk about efficiencies, but, as the Chairperson  highlighted, there is no clear definition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of a clear definition has given Departments the  breathing space or the wriggle room to come up with their own definitions, and  we sometimes see very different interpretations of efficiencies, compared with  what the rest of us believe them to be. We see very differing performances by  different Departments. I do not have time to go through deficiencies in every  Department, but I think that, at times, we have all been concerned by what has  come forward from various health trusts and through the Health Department,  masquerading as efficiencies when they are very clearly cuts to front line  services. The reduction in ambulance cover is one example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, when asked to come forward with its efficiencies  in respect of the revised expenditure plans, the Department for Social  Development simply took the 2&middot;6% adjustment in its total budget and apportioned  it to each of its main budget headings. There was no discernable attempt by  that Department to look at each individual line within each section of its  budget to decide what could take less. That was in complete contravention of  what had been agreed at the Executive, when some Departments took bigger hits  than others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson highlighted, questions put by Members to  Ministers about efficiencies and where they have had an impact on our  individual constituencies have, at times, been answered completely  ineffectively. I can personally recall asking questions of one Minister about  efficiencies within their Department; I asked the same question every possible  way to the point where I just gave up. That is not right, I should not be  giving up; I should be getting the answer and the information that I require  the first time. I should not have to repeatedly ask the same question to the  point of exasperation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the report highlights, there is evidence of Departments  charging more for services and saying that that is an efficiency. Yes, it might  sometimes be required that we raise the price of services being bought from the  public sector by the public, but sometimes that masks inefficiency. More money  coming in is not an efficiency and does nothing to drive further efficiency  into the system; in fact, sometimes it can encourage inefficiency. We have also  seen evidence of technical movements or reclassifications of money, which do  not mean that any more real money is produced. I could go on and on; for  example, about there being no clear evidence trail between the money that has  been saved and reinvestment back into Departments. I could talk at length about  investment delivery, efficiency delivery plans and whether they are any use,  given the number of them that there has been and the fact that some were not  published in good time. However, given the context of reduced spending, more  efficiencies and more cuts &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  We are going to have to learn many of the lessons that are included in this  report if we are to achieve what all of us want to achieve, which is actual  efficiencies, not cuts to front line services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Like Mr Hamilton, I thank those who sit on the Finance and Personnel Committee  for their work in bringing forward this report. It is undoubtedly an important  topic. In the brief time available to me, I want to focus on a couple of the  recommendations and some of the issues that emerge from them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note the flaws that are now appearing in  the way we do our Programme for Government and public service agreement (PSA)  planning and the inability of the PSAs to drive the change that we all hoped  for when they were agreed. I am glad to see that picked up on by the Committee,  which says that it:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;believes that the 2008-11 Programme for Government  and Public Service Agreement framework is cumbersome and overly complex in  terms of the need to prioritise at a time of exceptional budgetary constraint.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth noting that the culture in the Civil  Service may pose a difficulty in delivering the sort of behavioural change and  outcomes that the report seeks. On page 18 of the report, the authors consider  that at some length. I was struck by the recommendation at the bottom of that  page, which states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Committee recommends that, in its central  personnel role, DFP should ensure that the skills exist and are marshalled  within departments and their arms-length bodies to effectively examine systems  and processes for the purpose of identifying valid efficiencies; and, more  generally, that a culture of efficient delivery is embedded into the routine  responsibilities of public sector managers. The Committee also believes that  assurances are required in terms of the capability of departmental boards and  the governing bodies &hellip; to lead and oversee the efficiency drive.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is my experience of the system, too, which I  have gained during a previous role as a special adviser in the first mandate of  the Assembly when I worked as an official and since returning to the Assembly.  Furthermore, it was certainly my experience of the public service when I worked  outside it in private commerce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No organisation becomes efficient without a significant  change in its own culture. No amount of targets will make it efficient; no  amount of pieces of paper will drive efficiency. What those will do is lead the  system to find its old way of fixing the problem. It will find an old type of  solution to what is being presented to it as a new problem. Therefore, I hope  that, in his response, the Minister acknowledges that there may be some  capacity issues but also that there will undoubtedly need to be considerable  internal leadership, not just at senior departmental board level, as is  indicated by the report, but also at management level throughout the  Departments and the public bodies under this Assembly&rsquo;s responsibility, to  adopt a culture of efficiency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the report there is ample evidence that, whilst  we talk about efficiencies, we really engage, as Mr Hamilton alluded to, in  cuts. We just make them through the back door &mdash; stealthy, subtle cuts. I am  sure that Mr Storey, who is looking at me intently from across the Floor of the  Chamber, can find plenty of examples in education of stuff that is called  efficiency but is actually a cut. It may suit Members to walk into the Chamber  and make a political argument about that, but the truth is that it is probably  an administrative or systems failure. It is a capacity failure. When the system  is told to find a saving, it only understands one or two ways of being able to  do that. What is really welcome about the report, and what it says to me, is  that it is time to think differently about the way we manage our public service  budgets and to think differently about the type of manager we need in the  public service in order to deliver more efficient &mdash; rather than less &mdash;  government to the people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like previous Members who spoke, I could give ample  anecdotal examples of where efficiencies may be found, but, since I do not  speak for the SDLP on health any longer, I resist the temptation to go down  that route. However, in my new portfolio of regional development, one specific  area jumps to mind: rural transport. We have an education transport system, a  health transport system and Translink, all of which run buses around the  country, and they do not pick up the same people. That is not a cuts question;  it is an efficiency question. It is about how the system behaves differently &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  In order to guarantee a service for the people whom it should be serving.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  is a privilege to follow on from Mr McDevitt, who is doing a grand job as the  SDLP&rsquo;s unofficial acting spokesperson on finance, if I have put that correctly.  The debate and, more importantly, the report, have been sparked by widespread  concern about the difficulties Departments have had in wrestling with the  initial round of efficiency savings, in this case cash-releasing efficiencies,  as part of the 2008-2011 Budget. That concern is not just within the Assembly  but the wider community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The real concern is that, in many cases, what have been  billed as efficiency savings have become cuts. There have been real drops in  and consequences for services. The implications in the recommendations of the  report are not just of relevance in looking at how things could have been done  better; they are now much more relevant as a useful starting point for how we  can begin to grapple with the looming challenges that will come to us over the  lifespan of the next comprehensive spending review (CSR) period and over the  course of this financial year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The starting point is the question of what is meant by  efficiency savings and the distinction between those savings and cuts, which a  number of Members commented on. Another aspect worth stressing is that, when  the Government centrally, whether through Finance Departments or Executives and  Cabinets collectively, make decisions and ask for efficiency savings, there is  no real policing of what happens from there on. The expectation is that  Departments will rise to the challenge, but there is no understanding or  clarity around what they will do in practice. The realisation of efficiency  savings is a bottom-up process within government, and the patterns, policies  and practices used can vary greatly. There is a desire to see greater policing  at a central level to try to reach common understandings in government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an aside, there is concern among some members of the  Committee, and no doubt elsewhere in the Assembly, about the use that has been  made so far of the performance and efficiency delivery unit. It may not be  perfect, but it is a useful tool to assist Departments. The willingness of  different Ministers to engage with the unit and avail themselves of its  services is patchy. Sometimes, the Departments doing better with efficiency are  more willing to engage than those that have struggled and have been least  willing to engage. There is clear irony there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Productivity is important because it is at the heart of  what is meant by efficiency savings &mdash; getting greater levels of outputs with  less input and avoiding the temptation to have what are, in effect, false  efficiencies. Simply increasing charges for a particular service is not an  efficiency. Doing away with something that has been on offer is not an  efficiency; it is a cut.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Budget debate earlier, we mentioned the new  opportunities that may arise in things like prevention work, early intervention  and better joined-up action among Departments in more rounded ways of finding  efficiencies and better ways of reaching the outcomes and focusing on them as  being the way forward. Too often, the difficulty for Departments is that they  fall back on their statutory responsibilities and functions. The way they  operate is to draw the wagons around what they want to protect. It is often the  core costs, or at least what the Departments view as core costs, that are more  expensive. There is not the same legal authority or responsibility to do early  intervention work or co-operate with other Departments. That is viewed as  voluntary, and so does not happen. In many respects, that type of action can,  in itself, be a better way of doing things or avoiding the cost pressures,  which are ever arising for Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the Alliance Party&rsquo;s perspective, tackling the costs  of division in this society is part of an efficiency drive. Those costs are a  major distortion in our public finances. They are a major inefficiency in the same  way that the existence of a land border on the island of Ireland  may create inefficiencies in the provision of some public services. Those are  areas where we need to take the recommendations of the report and turn them  into practical reality to tackle those distortions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: As Chairperson of the Education  Committee, I have already reported to the House that the Committee was not in a  position to give its views on measures to address the savings and budget  pressures facing the Department of Education in the review of spending plans  earlier this year. That was because the Committee was not provided with the  information that it needed to assess the impact that potential reductions in  spend might have on education services, particularly front line classroom  services.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak about this in my capacity as a private Member  later, but, to date, the Committee for Education remains uninformed of the  impact of the current cuts in the Minister of Education&rsquo;s budget for 2010-11.  For that reason, I believe that the Committee for Education will welcome this  very timely report from the Committee for Finance and Personnel on its  preliminary inquiry into public sector efficiencies and will support its  conclusions and recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education has been briefed on the  Department of Education&rsquo;s efficiency delivery plans by departmental officials  on a number of occasions. In 2008-09, those efficiencies totalled some &pound;63  million and &pound;124 million in 2009-2010, and they will amount to &pound;184 million in  2010-11. More than half of those efficiencies &mdash; some &pound;215 million in total &mdash;  came or will come out of the aggregated schools budget. The Committee asked how  that impacted on schools&rsquo; staff numbers year on year. The Committee was  informed:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it would be difficult to assess the impact of the  overall efficiencies as this could differ from school to school.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was also told:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it would be difficult to assess the direct impact of  the efficiencies on staff numbers&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">in schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That situation, coupled with the fact that the Committee  has not been provided with information to assess the impact on schools of the current  cuts in education, leads me to conclude that the Department of Education&rsquo;s  school report on the subject might read &ldquo;could do better&rdquo;. I note and welcome,  in paragraph 4 of the Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s report, the call  for DFP and the wider Executive:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to make the necessary arrangements to ensure that, in  future, the requisite information and transparency is provided to enable the  Assembly and the wider public to track how such savings are applied.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, I remind Members of a recommendation,  which I hope will be actioned, that the Committee for Education recently put to  the Committee for Finance and Personnel on the Budget process. My Committee  recommended that standard guidance to Northern Ireland Departments on the  timing and the provision of relevant information to Assembly Statutory  Committees be drawn up by DFP, in consultation with Statutory Committees, and  submitted to the Executive Committee for consideration and agreement. Such  guidance could and should include a requirement that Departments provide timely  and clear information to Statutory Committees on efficiency savings,  particularly their impact on front line services. The commitment of individual  Ministers to that guidance would be essential, and DFP, again in consultation  with Statutory Committees, would monitor adherence to the standard guidance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude by commenting as a private Member. It is  imperative that we do not allow Departments to move away from their  responsibilities. Although I appreciate and accept much in the report on the  need for the Executive to take a lead, it is imperative that each Department be  in a position to provide relevant information to its Statutory Committee. It is  very difficult for the Education Committee to scrutinise the possible impact of  any efficiencies, without the relevant information about issues that were  raised by, for example, Mr McDevitt.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the  Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s report to the House.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Mitchel McLaughlin.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was in the middle of writing my speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome this debate. I want to develop a theme that  emerged from the earlier discussion this afternoon and that has been reflected  again in this debate. Informed debate about, and ownership of, the decisions  and policies that emerge in the Assembly require that common language,  parameters and definitions are deployed when we are challenged to respond to  budget reductions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People have a view that budgets were very challenging even  during the more benign circumstances that pertained when the Assembly was  restored. We have to be realistic and accept that our region is very small.  Many county councils and, indeed, cities in Britain and elsewhere have larger  budgets, provide more services and have more constituents than we represent. We  must address the question of efficiencies with the corporate vision that has  been referred to in previous discussions, and we must recognise that further  efficiencies can be identified. I was pleased when, during Question Time this  afternoon, the First Minister affirmed that greater efficiencies can be  identified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members, as I have said in previous debates, have set out  their difficulties in relating to Executive decisions or departmental  efficiency targets and the definition of &ldquo;efficiencies&rdquo; as achieving the same  output for less input, which is a fairly straightforward formula that should  help to eliminate the confusion that is sometimes deliberately contrived to  mask what are in fact cuts, as opposed to genuine efficiencies. A related  issue, and a major contradiction for the Assembly to consider, is the hard evidence  that the per capita cost of delivering front line services here is higher,  sometimes considerably higher, than elsewhere. Other regions are much closer to  achieving the axiom of the same output for less input. Indeed, in some  instances, they provide better services than us for less input. We must ask  ourselves why that is the case and what we can do about it in a practical way.  Even if it has to be a strategic approach that has to be dealt with over a  period of time, achieving parity over time is a genuine and measurable goal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another interesting word that crops up is &ldquo;inescapables&rdquo;.  In my opinion, it is a neat way to divert Ministers and Committees. What does  it actually mean? Should we accept the argument that efficiencies do not  include inescapables? I do not think that we should, especially as it often  refers to issues that have been dealt with over a considerable period of time,  long before the Assembly came into being. If we are to take responsibility for,  and ownership of, our Budget, we should set our own definitions and ensure that  we have relevant, measurable and transparent guidance that works across all  Departments to determine bona fide inescapable costs. Surely that is something  that the Assembly, rather than departmental officials, no matter how senior,  should decide at a political and policy level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes the Assembly is diverted by jargon and the  confidence with which people argue that money cannot be touched because it is  already committed. That is a form of ring-fencing and, I believe, of  ring-fencing inbuilt efficiencies. I am not arguing that the Assembly has to  take responsibility for how that situation emerged, because, as I said,  sometimes there is a considerable period of time involved. However, we should  take responsibility for examining it and for deciding whether we will stand  over it. We should start that process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, there has been much talk about the cost of  division &mdash; it came up during this debate and earlier this afternoon. We do have  to address historic underdevelopment and underinvestment in this tiny region.  The range of disparities is a challenge. If it is not addressed, we will not  heal those divisions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend the Committee for  Finance and Personnel for undertaking this report. It raises major and  important issues that need to be addressed not only about the efficiency of  government but that of the Civil Service. However, I will come to that later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is the Assembly&rsquo;s duty to debate such ideas. The SDLP  has been calling for such a debate for the past two years. Indeed, it was the  Finance Minister who, in the first instance, stubbornly refused to admit that  there was a problem with the finances. He then refused to redraw the Budget to  deal with the problem, and, last week, he claimed that MLAs needed to recognise  that the good times were over. Any MLAs who are in touch with their  constituents know that the good times have been over for quite a considerable  time. That includes people in my constituency. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know  that the construction and light engineering trade has been very badly hit. That  is not something new or sudden and it is not something that has emerged out of  the air recently and hit us bang in the face. Anyone who is in touch with their  communities knows that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister asked the Assembly to come up with proposals  to assist in the downturn. However, he refuses to recognise the SDLP&rsquo;s  proposals. We have stated continually our willingness to take on the challenges  of scoping the Budget to ensure that front line services are protected. Perhaps  the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in should end their policy of exclusive government and  engage with us on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we outlined in previous in-depth finance documents that  we published, we must restructure and redefine the Budget process to recast  Budget lines. Those lines should be demarcated according to the degree to which  they support front line services. As the report highlights, and as the SDLP has  said constantly since we voted against the current Budget, crude and disjointed  salami slicing will get us nowhere. Rather, it will simply put the most  vulnerable at risk. It is apparent from the report that there has been a  failure to achieve such demarcation throughout government. The report outlines  the Committee&rsquo;s concerns that there is no clear audit trail and that  arrangements must be made to ensure that the requisite information and  transparency be provided to enable the Assembly and the wider public to track how  such savings are applied. To do that, the Assembly should consider establishing  new Committees. One such Committee should be in the style of the Westminster  Public Accounts Committee and should permanently interrogate the cost of  government, and another should be charged with tracking and proofing  performance on capital investment across Departments and the Strategic  Investment Board.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Rather than the SDLP suggesting that we  have another Committee, would it not have been in its interests to have  supported Members on this side of the House last week when I said that we  should have fewer Committees? We do not need 108 MLAs or 12 Departments.  Instead of setting up another Committee, let us get rid of a lot of the ones  that we have. That would bring some efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I do not need any lectures from Members on that side of the House, given that,  last week, his party colleague blew &pound;9&middot;3 million on the review of public  administration, which was supposed to create efficiency around this place. If a  Committee had appropriately advised his colleague on such efficiencies, I am  sure that we would have been in a position to have done something about the  reform of local government and would have been able to achieve efficient,  accountable good governance about the place as opposed to blowing millions of  pounds. Anyway, I shall move on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the proposals in the report to provide Committees  with the expertise to better scrutinise departmental budgets. A Committee can  be efficient and effective in delivering efficient good governance for us. I  assure the House that we have seen the best of the Civil Service, but we have  certainly seen the worst of it. We have seen foot-dragging, inefficiency and,  at times, the inability to make a decision. That is not because people in the  Civil Service can blame their political masters; they are just unable to make  decisions and, therefore, are unable to deliver the proper good governance that  we are supposed to represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problems that the report outlines with Peter Robinson&rsquo;s  flagship PEDU projects illustrate the overall difficulties that exist with  efficiency. It is damning that the report has to conclude:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the delay in publication of the PfG progress and  delivery reports severely hinders the ability of Assembly statutory committees  to scrutinise departmental performances against PSA targets.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That brings us back to the question of public  sector efficiency.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report highlights what many of us have known for some  time, and what has been shielded by direct rule, which is that the Executive  are failing to work together and Departments are working on a silo basis. When  the Assembly was in its infancy, the SDLP implemented Executive programme funds  to encourage better joined-up working between Departments and to help to  protect the vulnerable. I urge the Executive to consider reinstating such an  approach of good, efficient governance in the interests of the entire community  to deliver what we all should be here to do: to deliver proper, effective and  transparent good governance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  First, I will comment on some of Mr McGlone&rsquo;s remarks. Some of the stuff that  he trotted out was amazing, bearing in mind that, for a long period of the time  that he spoke about, he was Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment,  which was supposed to be policing and shadowing the Minister and making him  accountable. Nevertheless, he came into the House today to tell us that &pound;9&middot;3  million has been blown. That just goes to show how well he was holding  everybody to account, which is what the Committees are supposed to do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Just sit down a minute and listen a bit more. He ranted on about Sinn F&eacute;in and  the DUP not talking to anybody else. I was not aware that the SDLP had left the  Executive. I was of the clear understanding that the SDLP still held on to its  ministerial post, even after it changed its leadership and its Minister.  However, perhaps that is something that Mr McGlone wishes to forget when  difficult decisions have to be made and difficult times have to be faced.  Everybody knows that we are in a difficult climate. It is no different in Mid  Ulster than it is in Fermanagh and South Tyrone or, I suspect, in any other  constituency. I can assure Mr McGlone that he does not have the monopoly on  hard times down there. They are all around for us to see on a daily basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the report on the preliminary inquiry into public  sector efficiencies by the Committee for Finance and Personnel. The Justice  Committee will be receiving a detailed briefing on the Department of Justice&rsquo;s  budget and the financial position on any emerging pressures at this week&rsquo;s  meeting on Thursday afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Justice has a budget of &pound;1&middot;4 billion, of  which 95% goes to arm&rsquo;s-length bodies, mainly the Police Service. It is,  therefore, important that the Committee familiarises itself quickly with the  various budget strands so that it is in a position to closely monitor the  Department&rsquo;s performance. For that reason, I welcome recommendation 12, which  should enable Assembly Statutory Committees to better assess departmental  efficiency delivery plans. I hope that Mr McGlone is listening: recommendation  12 will allow Assembly Statutory Committees to better assess departmental  efficiency delivery plans and will ensure that we are kept informed of any  changes to those plans, which is equally important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, given the current economic climate and the  undoubted need to reduce costs substantially, I will ensure that the Committee  for Justice follows up on the Department of Justice&rsquo;s efficiency plans and  measures. The Committee will be seeking clear, quantitative and qualitative  evidence of the services provided by the Department to enable the delivery of  any proposed efficiency measures to be accurately measured.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has already identified at least two areas of  spend &mdash; the cost for each prisoner place and legal aid funding &mdash; which it is  clear are much more expensive than most other countries. Although there may be  some unique features to our systems, they are not sustainable in the longer  term, given the economic realities that we all face. The key for Committees is  to have clear, timely and accurate information on spending plans, efficiency  targets and performance. The report&rsquo;s recommendation that there should be more  robust central monitoring of departmental efficiency plans, with the outcomes  reported to Assembly Committees on a timely basis, is helpful and should be  implemented as soon as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for Justice, I commend the  report of the Committee for Finance and Personnel to the House. I am delighted  that Mr McGlone has taken such a keen interest in listening to the debate. It  is obvious that he had not been doing so in his Committee, even when he was  Chairperson.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  I thank all the Members who took part in the debate. It was a constructive  debate, with the only sour note being introduced towards the end by Mr McGlone,  who, I suspect, is a bit miffed at not being asked to replace Mr O&rsquo;Loan as the  finance spokesman for the SDLP. However, having listened to his speech I can  understand why that decision was made. He did not seem to understand what the  debate was about, because he spent most of his time telling the House how  wonderful the SDLP&rsquo;s alternative Budget plan was. It seems that I know a bit  more about that plan than he does, because a lot of it was not about  efficiencies. It was about how money should be redirected in one direction or  another.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, had Mr McGlone listened to what other Members said  during the debate, he would have immediately recognised that one of the core  conclusions of the report was that efficiencies are not about cuts, redirecting  money or raising revenue, which were all part of the SDLP&rsquo;s alternative Budget  plan. That plan was created two years ago. Nevertheless, he has got the wrong  end of the stick.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone also said that if Committees were supervising  their Ministers properly, situations such as that which occurred with RPA would  not have happened. That was surprising, because he was the Chairperson of the  Committee for the Environment when I was Minister of the Environment, and I do  not remember him challenging the Minister too much then. In fact, he got  involved in trivialities and spent half his time investigating my views on  climate change, rather than looking at what I was doing in other parts of the &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I knew I would provoke him. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I am aware of the Minister&rsquo;s views on climate change, but will he accept that  it is not a triviality?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As far as I am concerned, the view that it is  man-made is a trivial response to an important issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind all Members to return to the subject of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I had to say that, because you let him off with five  minutes of wandering away from the report.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.] </span>I  only took two minutes to respond to him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is very timely and helpful. It is also  pragmatic, thoughtful, does not seek to score points and brings forward many  recommendations that we would do well to adhere to and examine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is timely because we are facing a period &mdash; as we  talked about during today&rsquo;s debate on the Final Stage of the Budget (No. 3)  Bill &mdash; in which there will be far greater resource pressures on Departments,  and we will need to examine how Departments do things and make changes. It is  also a period in which we must examine how Departments continue to deliver  services, what types of services they deliver and whether the current model for  delivering those services is the most efficient. We will have to try to get  more results from the money that we spend. Given that we are going to  experience a real reduction in budgets, with increased inflationary pressures  placed on Departments, new demands being made of them, and the current 3%  efficiency savings possibly increasing to 5% or more, the issues addressed in  the report are very important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members raised issues that I want to respond  to. Mr McDevitt and Dr Farry raised the issue of how we drive forward  efficiencies. Mr McDevitt made the very important point that it is all about  culture, and it is important that the culture starts with the Minister. As the  report indicated, there is no point in Ministers closing their eyes to the fact  that there must be changes in Departments, saying that things cannot be done,  or that their Department is too important. It must start with the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, it must be driven, and the Minister has to know  that he is being scrutinised by the Department. Thirdly, I understand that,  sometimes, Departments will need help. At that point, PEDU can come in. I have  been a Minister in two Departments where we brought PEDU in. In one case, I  made the decision, and, in the other case, I inherited the outcome that  resulted from a decision that was made by my predecessor. Therefore, I know  about the real work that can be done by an outside pair of eyes in identifying  the efficiencies, delivery and performance of Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In turn, that can help to generate the culture of thought  that is required to look at it as more than a one-off exercise. Mr McDevitt  made an important point when he said that this is not about fixing a problem  now. It is about continually looking at how things can be done better. That  requires a change in culture at lower management level, and there is no easy  answer to how that is done. In any big public sector organisation there will be  a degree of inertia, the attitude that because this is the way that something  has been done, it is the only way that we can do it, and we should not forget  that if we try to do things differently, it will have an impact on the people  we have worked with for years, and everything else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if there is no direction from the top and no help  with building the capacity, the change will not happen. That is another reason  why Committees must be continually involved in asking questions and looking at  what is being done. I am going to come to that point in a moment or two.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second point that has been made generally is on the  question of how efficiencies are measured and whether efficiencies are simply  about scaling back what Departments do. Is it simply about giving new charges  and raising money, saying that they become more efficient because they are  spending less money? What are pure efficiencies? There has been some criticism  of the way in which the efficiencies have been measured. One of the reasons why  the whole budgetary process is important here is that we do drill down and get  Departments to explain where savings have been made, what they have done with  the money, where front line services have been affected and where additional  savings have been made from them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I disagree with the report&rsquo;s point that perhaps we needed  more central control over how efficiencies were measured, recorded and driven.  Mervyn Storey made the point, and it comes back to the point that Conall  McDevitt made as well. I believe that efficiencies should be under the  ownership of individual Departments. That would reinforce the culture that is  being talked about, and Departments would not be able to run away from their  responsibility and blame DFP: &ldquo;They are imposing this on us, and, anyway, what  do they know about the way our Department operates?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, it is important that individual  Departments should retain control and oversight over efficiency savings. They  can be published centrally, but the role of the Department of Finance and  Personnel is to issue guidance so that there is a uniform measure and a uniform  way of looking at efficiencies and at what the content of any report should be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  As the Minister rightly points out, in large public sector organisations, a  documented, processual approach to management is needed. One of the key  attributes of successful efficiency is that it is often organic. It is by  empowering middle-ranked managers, who know their area most and best, that we  find solutions &mdash; a health solution to a health problem, or a transport solution  to a transport problem. By empowering them and giving them an incentive to  think outside their normal area of work and outside the box, they will find the  answer. Therefore, although I welcome the idea of formalising the process, I  hope that the Minister is not suggesting that we become bureaucratic in dealing  with efficiencies. That would become counterproductive.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That is right. The guidance must be flexible enough  not to be ignored and, at the same time, it must recognise that the approach in  different Departments might vary. Organisations and the efficiencies that they  must find may well be different. The debate has shown that the guidance cannot  be so loose that people do not know the meaning of an efficiency and simply  interpret it in whatever way they want. They may stop doing something and call  it an efficiency when, of course, it is not. The guidance must be structured in  a way that allows that kind of flexibility but, at the same time, ensures that  real measures of efficiency are obtained.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the important point about the role of Assembly  Committees in dealing with the issue. The report is very strong on that. I am a  bit worried about the proposal for monitoring and audits and for having  Committees to look at all of this. Mervyn Storey challenged Mr McGlone on that  point. That takes the role away from the Assembly Committees, and the report  rightly recommends that Assembly Committees should take a more prominent role  in scrutinising the efficiencies on a more regular basis and in calling  Ministers to account. Such an approach will also avoid bureaucratic problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said time and time again in the Assembly, it is  very easy for Members to call for more audits here and more information and  scrutiny there. That involves costs and has resource implications. It means  that data must be collected and reports must be written. There is no point in  making recommendations if we do not scrutinise them and ensure that they are  being implemented. Of course, that adds another layer on top of the work of  Assembly Committees. It may well stop Assembly Committees that are skirting  around the issues from taking up frivolous issues and may encourage them to get  on with the real job of doing the work that is required to ensure efficiency  savings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the recommendations are not only for DFP. They are  for the Executive and for Ministers right across Departments. As we have done  with the procurement report, we want the Executive to consider how all  Departments could engage with and respond to the report as it has been  presented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for, by and large, the constructive way in  which they have dealt with the issue, their endorsement of the efficiency  programme, their desire to ensure that the efficiency programme delivers what  it is meant to deliver and their support for the role of PEDU. Given that every  party &mdash; I have not heard from the Ulster Unionist Party, although I am sure  that Mr McNarry will give his view of PEDU during his winding-up speech &mdash; has  given a ringing endorsement of the proposals, I hope that those Ministers who  have been reluctant to allow PEDU to look at issues in their Departments will  reconsider the matter. I hope that the points about an outside group looking at  Departments will filter back to the Ministers in each of the parties, some of  whom have resisted the involvement of PEDU so far.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thanks very much to all those who have taken part in the  debate. We will look at the recommendations in the report and come back to the  Committee with a more considered response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McNarry)</strong>: With  the Minister in the House, it is a rare occasion on which I have the last word.  Indeed, it is rare for anyone else to have the last word. It is tempting to  take advantage of that situation, but, reluctantly, I must concede that the  report is more important even than my using such an opportunity, appealing as  it is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee report contains some constructive criticisms.  They were printed not for the sake of it but to elicit a response and, the  Committee trusts, action by the Department. It is clear from the debate and  from the Members who spoke that five minutes was not sufficient to allow most  Members to cover the extensive, wide-ranging nature of this excellent report. I  was pleased, on the Committee&rsquo;s behalf, that some Committee Chairmen  participated in the debate and brought to it the issues specific to their  Committee. However, this evening&rsquo;s significant debate was all the poorer for  not having enough Committee Chairmen participate in it. All Members know how  the five-minute rule works. If any Members feel the need to add to their  comments, I am sure that they will write to the Committee, which will welcome  them and take them on board. Even though the report is finalised, there remains  work in progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Wilson paid attention, as he demonstrated in his  response to the debate, and the Committee is grateful that he gave his time and  participated in the debate in a constructive manner. I am not sure whether he  would want that theme to be taken up &mdash; particularly by me. Nevertheless, he is  present for the debate, and he probably considers, given the nature of  Committee reporting, that it is his duty to be here. The Committee wants any of  his ministerial colleagues who were not listening to the debate to make it  their business to do so. We will see to it that their officials bring them a  full briefing on what has been said today and on their analysis of the report.  I am sure that the Hansard report will fulfil that role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It goes without saying that the debate was extremely  useful. I thank Members and the Minister for their contributions. As the  Committee Chairperson said at the outset, we intend the report to provide a  useful and positive contribution to the discussions on the best way forward in  driving on further public sector efficiencies. Today&rsquo;s debate has given all of  us an opportunity to consider those matters, and I trust that the Minister and  his Executive colleagues will take on board the views that have been expressed  as they deal with the pressures that will be made known to us in the coming  days.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before turning to the various issues that arose during the  debate, I will speak briefly about the performance and efficiency delivery unit  (PEDU) in DFP, which was mentioned by some Members. In April 2008, when the  former Finance Minister made a statement to the Assembly on the creation of  PEDU, he told the House that it would have a twin focus on efficiency and  delivery. Members were told that PEDU would fulfil the efficiency aspect of its  remit when invited by an Executive Minister to investigate a particular  departmental business area. At the time of PEDU&rsquo;s creation, the Committee was  broadly supportive of the intention behind it. However, only two Departments  have commissioned its services for two specific business areas, and the  Committee, therefore, has concerns about the outworking of the unit. Perhaps an  external figurehead, as originally envisaged, would have enhanced the  willingness of Departments to engage with PEDU, as it would then have been  regarded as having more independence. In its report, the Committee has,  therefore, called on DFP to bring forward options that would seek to improve  the uptake of PEDU services among Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to some of the key themes that have emerged from the  inquiry and this evening&rsquo;s debate. I shall endeavour, on behalf of the  Committee, to link any key points made by Members with the themes that we have  raised, rather than simply rehearse each contribution to the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first theme that we wanted addressed was the need for  clarity and consistency in terminology. When we talk about efficiency savings  or when that term is used by the media, terms such as budget cuts and  value-for-money savings are used interchangeably to describe approaches to  addressing public expenditure pressures. At the same time, there is increasing  concern over the impact of delivering more with less on priority public  services. Efficiency savings can be effectively delivered only when the  Executive and DFP establish a clear and consistently used definition of valid  efficiency savings. In simple terms, efficiencies are about achieving the same  with less or achieving more with the same, and that is what the report calls  for. I think that that is the point that the Minister was making earlier. The  report has highlighted the work of the National Audit Office, which makes it  clear that efficiency is not about reducing costs if it compromises the quality  or quantity of outputs. That point is worth making.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our second theme focused on the need for transparency in  how savings are achieved and applied. The Chairperson has mentioned the helpful  contribution of the Northern Ireland Audit Office, alongside its counterparts  in Wales and Scotland, in  producing a good practice efficiency checklist. That can be used by board  members and senior managers in their oversight function and can be used to  self-assess an organisation against good practice and to identify actions for  improving efficiency and productivity. In the Committee&rsquo;s opinion, the use of  such a guide, alongside a clearer definition of valid efficiencies from DFP,  can only help to improve the transparency of information that is available.  That will be a useful tool for elected representatives as we seek to effectively  scrutinise departmental activity. Importantly, it will also help the wider  public to understand what Departments are seeking to deliver and how efficiency  savings are being redirected to fund the services on which they rely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third theme is the important need for a strategic  approach. I think that all of us agree that a strategic approach is required to  achieve the savings that the Executive have been tasked to deliver. That  confirms the view of Professor Colin Talbot, to whom the Chairperson referred.  Professor Talbot told the Committee that the worst way to implement  efficiencies is by top-slicing across the board, because it damages what one  wishes to keep and protects what one does not want to keep. Although that may  represent, to some, a quick fix, Professor Talbot also warned Members that it  can be extremely damaging to public services, especially in the long term. We  have taken note of that. He also advised that some areas of the public sector  will find it easier to achieve efficiency savings and a system should,  therefore, be developed to identify where major efficiencies could be made and,  conversely, areas where no efficiency savings are achievable. It is vital,  therefore, that that strategic approach is also adopted by individual Members  and, collectively, by the Executive to avoid salami-slicing, a term which  Members have used.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the Executive finally decide on the matter, robust  safeguards must be in place to ensure that there is no reduction in the level  and quality of service provision in priority areas. Furthermore, it is vital  that efficiencies being claimed at a departmental level are not having a  negative effect on the efficiency of the wider public sector.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth theme of the report on the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry  concerns effective monitoring. During its evidence sessions with DFP officials,  the Committee learned that primary responsibility for planning and delivery of  the 3% efficiency savings that were required after the 2007 comprehensive  spending review lies with individual Ministers and their Departments. The role  of DFP, it seems, is only to monitor the delivery of savings and collate  information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not speaking personally in this debate; I am speaking  for the Committee. However, I will deviate from that slightly: one thing that I  would like to see changed is the role of the DUP &mdash; DFP when it comes to  savings. [Laughter.] I would also like to see the role of the DUP changed, but  as I am not into predictions any more, I will probably have to wait to see what  happens this time next year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will give way.  May I ask a question to which you know the answer, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you  would be so obliging? Do I lose time if I give way, or do I not?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You do not gain any time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Aye, all right. I  am still having the last word, whatever the Minister says.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member makes an important point. Is the danger  of going down the route that the Deputy Chairperson suggests not that Ministers  then lose responsibility and can say that the responsibility lies with DFP and not  them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Perhaps we will get  to that debate on another day. Part of the problem has been that Ministers have  been passing the buck. I exclude the Minister of Finance and Personnel from that  because he seems to be taking a stand at present, and more power to him. The  Committee is saying that, if decisions are to be taken, Ministers will be held  accountable. Other Members made the point earlier, as did the Minister, that  scrutiny Committees have a role in holding all Ministers to account. That is  what we have got to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s report makes an important point about where  we are now. I can answer the Minister&rsquo;s question by saying that Departments  must provide quantitative and qualitative evidence &mdash; I heard that phrase being  used earlier &mdash; of the inputs and outputs that are associated with the specific  services that they provide for the purpose of ensuring more effective valuation  and measurement of efficiency gains.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fifth and final theme of the report concerns the scope  for further savings. That is crystal ball-gazing stuff, but the challenges are  right in front of us and the Executive now, and they are not here for only the  short term. There must be and we believe that there are benefits in achieving  real public sector efficiency gains in the medium to long term, as that will  assist in minimising and managing any further expenditure pressures in the year  ahead, and that is key.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The evidence presented to the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry pointed  to several broad areas where additional efficiencies could be achieved, such as  measures to further reduce bureaucracy, eliminate duplication of services and  improve human resources management practice; further use of shared services,  not just across Departments but covering arm&rsquo;s-length bodies and local  government; more strategic co-ordination of the public procurement functions,  including collaborative purchasing between the different levels of government;  measures to achieve savings from accommodation expenditure, including a central  policy on remote working and fundamentally good practice; and asset management  and capital realisation, including the urgent establishment of a comprehensive  mandatory central asset register for all public bodies to assist in identifying  surplus property.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we move into a period of constrained public spending,  there is much more work to be done. Input will be required from key  stakeholders, other Statutory Committees and the wider public to allow for  fuller exploration. I can do nothing else as a keen and proud member of the  Finance Committee but ask the House to support the Committee&rsquo;s motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the report of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel on its preliminary inquiry into public sector  efficiencies; and calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel, in  conjunction with Executive colleagues, to implement, as applicable, the  recommendations contained therein.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 7.20 pm.</p>
