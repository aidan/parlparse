    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a1" id="a1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Before we begin, I wish to advise the House that a valid petition of  concern was presented on Thursday 10 February relating to the votes on the  clauses and the long title, whether amended or not, of the Armed Forces and  Veterans Bill. The votes on those matters, which will be on a cross-community  basis, may take place later today.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a2" id="a2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget Bill 2011: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: Morning, Mr Speaker. You are looking  fresh and well after last night&rsquo;s long session. However, I see that some other  Members have not made it here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Budget Bill 2011 be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Accelerated passage of the Bill is needed to ensure Royal  Assent as early as possible in March and, therefore, legal authority for  Departments and other public bodies to draw down and spend the cash and use the  resources in the Bill in 2010-11 and to ensure the continuation of public  services into 2011-12.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the House is by now well aware, preparation of the  detailed Estimates and the related Budget Bill under consideration today,  sandwiched between the December monitoring outcome announced to the Assembly as  late as 17 January and the urgent need for Royal Assent of the Bill as quickly as  possible to allow drawdown on the additional cash voted, is a difficult task  for all concerned. I am, therefore, grateful that the Committee for Finance and  Personnel has confirmed, in line with Standing Order 42, that it is satisfied  that there has been appropriate consultation with it on the public expenditure  proposals in the Bill and is content that the Bill may proceed by accelerated  passage. I welcome and appreciate the assistance of the Committee in the  matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now briefly outline the purpose of the legislation  and draw attention to the main provisions of the Bill. The debate follows the  Bill&rsquo;s First Stage yesterday, which, in turn, followed the debate on and  approval of the Supply resolutions for the 2010-11 spring Supplementary  Estimates and the 2011-12 Vote on Account. The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to give  legislative effect to the 2010-11 spring Supplementary Estimates and the  2011-12 Vote on Account, which were laid before the Assembly on 7 February  2011. Copies of the Budget Bill and the explanatory and financial memorandum  were made available to Members today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to take up valuable debating time with  unnecessary repetition of the detail that I gave Members yesterday. However, in  accordance with the nature of a Second Stage debate, as envisaged under  Standing Order 32 and for the benefit of Members, I will summarise briefly the  main features of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the issue of  &pound;15,345,417,000 from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund in 2010-11. That is  an additional &pound;695,505,000 since the Main Estimates were presented last year.  That cash will be drawn down on a daily basis as needed from the Northern  Ireland Consolidated Fund, which is managed by my Department on behalf of the  Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also authorise the use of resources totalling  &pound;16,233,236,000 by Departments and certain other bodies, which is some  &pound;631,768,000 more than was approved in the Main Estimates last March and June.  Those amounts are detailed in part 2 of each spring Supplementary Estimate for  2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Bill revises the 2010-11 limit on the  amount of accruing resources that may be directed by my Department to be used  for the purposes that are listed in column 1 of schedule 2. That limit includes  operating and non-operating accruing resources or, in other words, current and  capital receipts, and amounts to &pound;2,356,226,000. Under section 8 of the  Government Resources and Accounts Act (Northern Ireland) 2001, a direction  on the use of accruing resources will be provided by way of a Department of  Finance and Personnel (DFP) minute, which will be laid before the Assembly in  March, following Royal Assent to the Bill. Therefore, not only will the Bill  authorise the use of resources, it will authorise accruing resources, bringing  resources for use by Departments and other public bodies to over &pound;18&middot;5 billion.  The sums to be issued from the Consolidated Fund are to be appropriated by each  Department or public body for services as listed in column 1 of schedule 1 to  the Bill. Resources, including the accruing resources, are to be used for the  purposes that are specified in column 1 of schedule 2 to the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amounts now requested for 2010-11 supersede the Vote on  Account in the Budget Act (Northern Ireland) 2010, which was passed this time  last year, and the Main Estimate provision in the Budget (No.2) Act (Northern  Ireland) 2010, which was passed in March prior to the stage two devolution of  policing and justice in the Budget (No.3) Act (Northern Ireland) 2010, which  was passed by the Assembly in June.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also authorise a 2011-12 Vote on Account for  cash of &pound;6,645,663,000 and resources of &pound;7,336,432,000 to allow the flow of  cash and resources to continue to public services in the early months of  2011-12 until the Main Estimates and related Budget Bill are approved later  this year in June. Again, the cash and resources are to be appropriated and  used for services and purposes set out in column 1 of schedules 3 and 4  respectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, clause 5 authorises temporary borrowing by the  Department of Finance and Personnel at a ceiling of &pound;3,327,331,000 for 2011-12.  That is approximately half the sum authorised in clause 4(1) for issue out of  the Consolidated Fund for 2011-12, and is a normal safeguard for any temporary  deficiency arising in the fund. I stress to the House that clause 5 does not  provide for the issue of any additional cash out of the Consolidated Fund or  convey any additional spending power but it enables my Department to run a very  efficient cash-management regime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is little more that I can usefully add on the detail  of the Budget Bill, but I will be happy to deal with any points of principle or  detail that Members wish to raise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McKay)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat,  a Cheann Comhairle. The Budget Bill provides statutory authority for  expenditure as set out in the spring Supplementary Estimates 2010-11. The Bill  also includes the Vote on Account, which allows Departments to incur  expenditure and use resources in the early part of 2011-12 until the Main  Estimates are voted on by the Assembly in early June.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 42(2) states that accelerated passage may be  granted for a Budget Bill provided that the Committee for Finance and Personnel  is satisfied that it has been appropriately consulted on the public expenditure  proposals contained in the Bill. At its meeting on 2 February, departmental  officials briefed the Committee and took questions on the Budget Bill being  debated today. That evidence session represented the culmination of a process  of scrutiny by the Committee of the public expenditure issues of DFP as a  Department and at a strategic and cross-departmental level throughout 2010-11.  Following that evidence session, the Committee was content to grant accelerated  passage, and I wrote to the Speaker informing him of the Committee&rsquo;s decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The forthcoming financial year will be the first year of  the 2011-15 Budget, which is yet to be finalised and agreed by the Assembly. In  line with convention, the Finance and Personnel Committee will publish a  co-ordinated response to the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget 2011-15 proposals. To  inform its report, the Committee examined a range of strategic and  cross-cutting issues. Those include, for example, the budgetary process, the  presentation of the draft Budget document, the basis for the proposed  allocations, savings delivery plans, longer-term efficiency savings, levers for  rebalancing the economy, and preventative spending. In addition, responses to spending  and savings plans for each Department have been received from the respective  Statutory Committees and submissions have also been received from the Assembly  Commission and the Audit Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Committee expects to finalise its report tomorrow,  and urges the Finance Minister to ensure that it is brought to the attention of  the Executive at the earliest opportunity. The Executive must take full  cognisance of the findings and recommendations contained therein before the  draft Budget 2011-15 is finalised and laid before the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking from a party point of view, it is worth bearing in  mind that the Budget shortage of &pound;4 billion is a direct result of the British  Conservatives and their colleagues in the Ulster Unionist Party, and their ideological  position that deep public cuts somehow make economic sense and the private  sector will balance the economy: a concept that I do not agree with. As we  know, the cuts are far too deep. We want to see small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs) and indigenous businesses grow and develop, and we want a  healthy balance between indigenous businesses and foreign direct investment  (FDI), which will bring highly paid jobs and create more local jobs and more  SMEs through the services sector, etc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why concepts such as the devolution of corporation  tax are so important. The Minister has expressed some concerns about  corporation tax, and I recognise that there are concerns. We need to be careful  in how we use those powers. We need to ensure that we adopt a strategy on  corporation tax that is balanced and brings in money at the right time and that  we present that in such a way that is successful for the local economy.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also want to see front line public sector jobs being  protected. The education budget, in how it was drawn up, is a good example of  how to protect front line services. That has been recognised by the Irish  National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation (INTO). The British Government have cut the  Budget too deep, and the danger is that, by doing that, the wheels of the  economy could grind to a halt. That is why we need to take responsibility for  our own economic destiny.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to a bit of &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; on my way  here. There was talk about the Ulster  Unionist Party possibly walking away and Michael McGimpsey walking away as the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. I wonder whether anybody  in the Health Department would notice if he walked away because we need to bear  in mind that the Assembly shuts down next month for the elections. At the end  of the day, it is about political posturing. If the Ulster Unionists run away  from their responsibilities, someone with a backbone should tackle the absolutely  obscene salaries that are being paid to consultants and senior managers in that  Department and channel such moneys towards front line services. Michael  McGimpsey should have done that job for the past four years, but, quite  frankly, he has not been at the races.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for giving way. Does he also note  a certain irony that the Health Minister and, indeed, the Ulster Unionist Party  are threatening to walk away from the Executive but that they have waited for  four years to walk away? They have pocketed their salaries for four years, but  perhaps they will sacrifice their last two days&rsquo; salary. Does the Member think  that the public will have a certain amount of cynicism about that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I fully agree with the Member.  Last night, when I went home, I caught a repeat of the leadership debate from  the Southern elections, in which the five leaders discussed issues such as the  need for some of the Ministers down South to return the vast sums of pensions  and bonuses that they will receive in the wake of stepping down. If the Ulster  Unionist Ministers or Ministers from other parties step down, I think that the  public will recognise that as Ministers running away from the job. As such,  perhaps they should hand back some of the money because they have not done the  job that they have been placed there to do. It is very petty for the Ulster  Unionist Party to be playing politics with an issue as significant &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come back to the Bill, as far as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: &mdash; as health because it is a  vital issue. Health is a big part of this Budget, so it is important that we  make those points.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the debate ahead. The Executive and the  Assembly &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member and his colleague opposite seem to be acting in unison in the  DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in coalition leadership. As regards salaries in the medical  profession, does he accept that there can be difficulties in attracting  professionals to places such as Altnagelvin Area Hospital and the west of the  Province, and that if salaries in this part of the United Kingdom for jobs that  are in short supply were reduced below those in other parts, there would be  even more calamity and shortages of essential posts? Is he prepared to accept  the responsibility for the delays, such as in reassessing X-rays, which might  follow?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am glad that the Member  raised the issue of Altnagelvin and the north-west because we all know of the  scare stories that the Health Minister has put out about the cancer centre in  the north-west, which will be built but not staffed. There have been other  stories about x thousands of jobs being lost, but the Health Minister has not  provided any detail to his Committee. To be honest, he has treated the members  of his Committee like mushrooms because he has kept them totally in the dark.  That is disgraceful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, in the debate on whether to extend the Committee  Stage of the pleural plaques Bill, we discussed how Committees relate to the  Executive and the Assembly. In this instance, the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety needs to be treated with respect and provided with  detail of the Health Minister&rsquo;s draft budget because, if Members look at the  detail on the budgets from each Department &mdash; for example, there are about 40 or  50 pages worth of detail in the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s (DRD)  draft budget &mdash; there is very little detail in the Department of Health Social  Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) one. The Minister and the Member should  reflect on that and ensure that, in future, when Ministers from the Member&rsquo;s  party bring budget details to the House or to their respective Committees, they  should provide full details. DHSSPS has around 50% of the entire Budget, so it  is absolutely scandalous that the detail &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The Chairperson makes a good point about the level of detail and the way in  which Ministers present their budgets to the Assembly. Does he agree that we  should allow Ministers to scrutinise one another&rsquo;s budgets and that we should  have a budgetary Committee &mdash; separate from the Chairperson&rsquo;s Committee, which,  as the Committee for Finance and Personnel, has broader responsibilities &mdash; that  is capable of scrutinising budgets and exists just to do that? Does he agree  that the system is broken and that, unless the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in work to fix  it, we will continue to have bad Budgets?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: It is important to recognise  that each Department has a Committee to shadow it and that each Committee  should have full details of its Department&rsquo;s budget and be treated with respect  by its Minister. In this instance, that has not been the case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Chairperson for giving way. Although I happen to agree with  Conall McDevitt&rsquo;s comments about the importance of having a proper scrutiny  process and, indeed, having a budgetary Committee rather than simply a  Committee for Finance and Personnel, does the Chairperson agree that central to  making the system work across the board is parties taking seriously their place  on the Executive and not playing games?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I absolutely agree with the  Member&rsquo;s comments, because one cannot &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Chairperson give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me finish my sentence  first. I will give way in a moment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I just want to know whether it is my party that is playing games. Which party  is it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will give way. Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Who exactly is the Chairperson accusing of playing games? Who is playing games  with the Executive? Who is playing games with the lives of the people of Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: You are &mdash; short and simple.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Me personally?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: No, the Tory boys in the corner  generally.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members should make their remarks through the Chair. Order. Allow the  Chairperson to be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I recognise and agree fully  with Mr Farry&rsquo;s comments. The Executive should act cohesively and coherently.  Members from the Ulster Unionist Party and the member from the SDLP cannot  continue to go into the Executive and mess about. In Michael McGimpsey&rsquo;s case,  sometimes he does not bother to go in at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another example is the way in which the SDLP went into the  Budget review group, which was set up, collectively, to look at ways of  generating revenue to mitigate the impact of the cuts. What did the SDLP do? It  left the Budget review group, taking all the good suggestions, which it then  put into a nice document that it released in December last year &mdash; two months  after all the other parties released their respective proposals on the  comprehensive spending review.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Perhaps he was not paying attention during  last night&rsquo;s debate, but is he aware that, in April 2009, the SDLP produced  comprehensive proposals on the Budget and how to reform it to protect front  line services and to create jobs? I shall quote from the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; at  the time:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The SDLP proposals are most appealing in terms of  employment protection, enhanced training schemes, a wage subsidy scheme and  support for nursing jobs&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will the Chairperson point out which of those  useful proposals the Executive actually adopted?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I love how the SDLP refers  continually to &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Ah.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: How are you doing, Dolores?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I love how the SDLP refers continually to its 2009 document  and to how all its great ideas emanated from it. I remember one of its Members  saying on the radio that the SDLP came up with the idea of the plastic bag levy  &mdash; it was in its 2009 document, so everybody else copied the SDLP. When the  SDLP&rsquo;s document was released in 2009, I and other members of Sinn F&eacute;in were  drafting proposals for a Bill to introduce a plastic bag levy. Therefore, I  will not accept anything from that document as fact, because although the SDLP  was, at that time, putting forward what it sees as proposals, we were already  implementing them, and that is a fact.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Again we are hearing SDLP Members&rsquo; suggestions,  allegations, assertions or whatever. Does the Member agree that during  yesterday&rsquo;s lengthy debate on the SDLP amendment, not one member of the party  who spoke addressed the amendment? It was so lacking in substance that SDLP  members could not even address it, so they spent the day criticising everybody  else. They told everybody what was wrong. Having tabled an amendment, they did  not have the courtesy to address it, or I suppose they were intelligent enough  not to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, on the SDLP&rsquo;s point that it wants to have a  budgetary Committee or other ways of scrutinising the finances, is it not the  case that there is an Executive subgroup on the Budget on which the SDLP has a  member? Is it not also the case that there is a Finance Committee in the  Assembly on which the SDLP has members? Do we not also routinely debate all  matters of finance in the Assembly? Will anybody tell me, or can the Minister  or the Committee Chairperson tell me, whether there is any opportunity that the  SDLP does not have to discuss and scrutinise all matters of finance? It has the  same opportunities as everybody else, but the party lacks so much substance  that it cannot address even its own amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his  intervention. I fully recognise &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, in a point of order to the Deputy  Speaker, our party asked whether you, as Speaker, would confirm that the advice  given to our party on how we could bring forward an amendment was based on  advice from the Business Committee, and that it was the only opportunity for us  to raise &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. We are having a different debate this morning. All that I can say to the  House is that the amendment that was tabled was competent. Let us move on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. I agree with what Alex Maskey said. It is clear that although other  parties in the Assembly have tried to approach the Budget constructively  because of the seriousness of the situation, the party to my left is more  concerned about getting PR out of this. I do not know who is behind that party  strategy, but it has left the party with egg on its face, as was clearly  demonstrated last night. We will not take any lessons on economics from the  SDLP. I am addressing the Member for Upper Bann Dolores Kelly. Let us remember  that her party has had coffee mornings with Fianna F&aacute;il and Brian Cowen and has  canvassed and knocked doors with Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  May I once again encourage the Member to come back to the Budget? Let us not  discuss tea parties. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Of course, the politics of  Fianna F&aacute;il and the D&aacute;il and their economic strategies have an impact on  economic flow, trade, and so on, on this part of the island. The SDLP should  reflect on that. Margaret Ritchie has clearly demonstrated that she is quite  close to Fianna F&aacute;il. Indeed, on a recent episode of &lsquo;The Politics Show&rsquo;, she  said that Brian Cowen did a good job. Well, I am sure most people on this  island would not agree with you, Ms Ritchie.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I once again say to the Member; as far as possible, let us come back to  the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Executive and the Assembly have many  challenges ahead. We should approach those head on in a collective and  constructive manner, without any messing about by any of the parties. I hope  that all parties in the House take cognisance of that, because the British  Government, supported by the Ulster Unionist Party, have cut the block grant by  &pound;4 billion. They have cut capital funding by some 40%. More recently, they have  stolen millions of pounds of end-year flexibility. Actions such as those &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Actions such as those are  reason enough &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Actions such as those are  reason enough for this Assembly to move to devolve fiscal and taxation powers  because the British Government clearly do not act in the best interests of  those we represent. That has been made quite clear by their actions over the  past year and in many years before it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice (Lord Morrow)</strong>: Follow that. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>One of the key issues to be resolved in  relation to the Department of Justice budget for the next financial year and  beyond was whether it could continue to be ring-fenced. The Executive&rsquo;s draft  Budget proposes that the Department of Justice budget will remain ring-fenced  for the Budget period. The Justice Committee wishes to dispel any  misconceptions that, as a result of ring-fencing the Department of Justice  budget for this period, the budget will be protected and will not face any  reductions. The outcome of the proposals to continue to ring-fence the budget  is that it will receive the direct Barnett consequentials arising from changes  in the level of funding of the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice as a  result of the UK  spending review settlement for Whitehall Departments. The result of that is  that the Department of Justice faces an overall reduction in its cash baseline  of some &pound;82 million, which is 7&middot;2%, by 2014-15.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Taking into account the effect of inflation, the real term  impact is significantly greater. The Justice Committee notes that ring-fencing  the Department&rsquo;s budget results in it having a slightly worse resource baseline  than the average Northern    Ireland settlement. However, the Committee  welcomes the fact that, as part of the ring-fencing of the budget, the  Department of Justice has guaranteed access to underspend generated this year  and throughout the Budget 2010 period. That will provide important flexibility  for the Department and, as far as the Committee is aware, is not available to  any other Department in Northern Ireland  or the United Kingdom.  The Committee views the retention of end-year flexibility for the Department of  Justice as a distinct advantage. Taking everything into account, the Committee  is of the view that ring-fencing is the most appropriate position to take on  the Department of Justice&rsquo;s budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now want to move on to one of the most crucial issues  with the proposed budget for the Department of Justice, namely the continued  access to the Treasury reserve to fund exceptional security pressures faced by  the PSNI. The Chief Constable has indicated a requirement for approximately  &pound;250 million over the next four-year period. In the draft Budget, the Executive  have allocated an additional &pound;45 million to the Department of Justice, and the  Department intends to use that to contribute to meeting the security funding  pressures facing the PSNI. A bid for &pound;200 million has been with Treasury for  some time, and the Department is waiting for confirmation that the bid has been  successful. Those who attended yesterday&rsquo;s debate will recall that I mentioned  that. It is a vital part of the Justice budget, particularly in relation to  policing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is extremely concerned about the implications  for the Department of Justice budget if that bid is not met in full. In  response to questions from members, departmental officials indicated that there  is no contingency plan in the event that the bid is unsuccessful and admitted  that taking &pound;200 million from the rest of the Department&rsquo;s budget would result  in it being in severe difficulties. The Committee believes that, if the bid is  unsuccessful or only partially successful, the implications for the  Department&rsquo;s budget in 2011-12 and up to 2012-15 are such that it will not be  possible to agree the Department of Justice budget until confirmation of the  granting of the bid is received.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee urges the Minister of Justice and the  Minister of Finance and Personnel to press for a decision to be made as a  matter of great urgency. Given that we are now debating the Second Stage of the  Budget Bill and being asked to approve the Vote on Account that relates to the  first year of the four-year Budget period, it is imperative that confirmation  is received from Treasury as soon as possible that that security funding bid  will be met in full from the reserves.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Given that, only last Thursday, the Chief Constable again indicated that the  dissident threat in Northern Ireland  continues to be severe, will the Member agree that meeting the security bid of  &pound;200 million is imperative if the level of security in Northern Ireland  is to be maintained? Furthermore, given the Home Secretary&rsquo;s previous comments  that the dissidents pose a threat not only to Northern   Ireland but to mainland United   Kingdom, will he agree that security is an issue for the  whole of the United Kingdom?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice</strong>: I thank my colleague Mr Spratt for his  well-made point that funding for security is not only vital to Northern Ireland  but has wider implications. If that bid were not made, there would be  implications not only for this region of the United   Kingdom but for other regions of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  As part of the agreements reached at Hillsborough, was it not the understanding  that the first &pound;12 million of claims for hearing loss would be met out of  Executive funds? Is he surprised to discover that the money is in the budget  line for the PSNI this year and that there is considerable concern in the PSNI  that it will remain in its budget line for the next four years? Will he agree  that such funds detract from the fight against terrorism and that those funds  ought to be made up by the Executive?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice</strong>: I heard what the Member said, but he can rely  on the Committee for Justice to debate and discuss those issues. We have gone  through all of those matters in great detail, and, if his party colleagues who  are members of the Committee were in attendance when that happened, I am sure  that they will confirm that. I take his point about that &pound;12 million of  funding, and, as a Committee, we are extremely concerned. We are keeping a  close eye on that, and I assure the Member that it will not go by default.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s decision to allocate  an additional &pound;45 million to the Department of Justice budget. I turn to the  key funding priorities for the 2011-15 Budget period and the funding for the  next year, which the Vote on Account will support initially at the beginning of  the 2011-12 Budget period. The Minister of Justice has identified those  priorities: first, protecting front line policing; secondly, protecting other  front line areas across the Department with the aim of protecting outcomes for  the public; and, thirdly, protecting the voluntary and community sectors as far  as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In scrutinising the Department&rsquo;s draft budget allocations,  the Committee notes that the figures provided indicate that funding has been  skewed towards the priorities of policing and justice. However, based on the  information that has been available to date, the Committee is unable to assess  properly and accurately the likely implications of funding reductions on the  delivery of front line policing and other services. The Committee is concerned  that nearly all of the draft savings plans that have been provided by the  Department refer to achieving savings through the suppression of posts,  redeployment of headcount, workforce modernisation, observing vacancies,  natural wastage, reductions in office equipment, reductions in training costs,  reviews of the frequency of research work, etc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of particular interest are indications from two justice  organisations, the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and the Probation Board, that  redundancies may be needed to achieve the savings that they are being asked to  deliver. The Committee has considerable concerns about that. The Committee is  also concerned about the likely impact on the ability of those organisations  and, indeed, the Department as a whole, to deliver services. The Committee  wishes to see detailed impact assessments from each area of the Department of  the implications of the proposed savings measures. Until those are available,  the Committee is not in a position to make an accurate judgement of the  Department&rsquo;s draft budget. In the meantime, the Committee also wants further  consideration to be given to the situation facing the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s office  and the Probation Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Committee welcomes the Minister of Justice&rsquo;s  commitment to protect the voluntary and community sectors as far as possible,  we have reservations due to the lack of information available about the level  of protection that is being afforded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to delivering savings, the Committee notes that  the Prison Service cash baseline will reduce by &pound;18 million by 2014-15. That is  to be achieved through an invest-to-save programme, for which &pound;13 million is  being provided in 2011-12, and a strategic efficiency and effectiveness  programme. The Committee is concerned about the ability to deliver the savings required  and about whether the provision of &pound;13 million is a realistic amount to achieve  the possible range of reforms that may be required. The Committee wishes to see  the details of the proposed efficiency and effectiveness programme as soon as  possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Justice Committee welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s decision to  allocate an additional &pound;57 million capital funding to the Department of Justice  budget, &pound;30 million of which is for the Desertcreat training college.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  The honourable Member will be aware of the frustration felt by those who are  dealing with the Desertcreat training college. For some time, the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety held back on announcing any capital  funding for the Fire and Rescue Service aspect of the project. Does it surprise  the Chairperson to know that, at a meeting of the Policing Board last Thursday,  members of the PSNI senior management team indicated that the latest stalling  tactic of the Minister of Health is to say that if the college were built and up  and running, he would not have the funding to pay for his part of it. I would  have thought that the Minister of Health already had the running costs for  training for the Fire and Rescue Service factored into his budget to carry out  that training. It is another stalling tactic by the Minister of Health to  frustrate that project.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice</strong>: I was coming to the point that my honourable  friend made. The Department of Health&rsquo;s stance, particularly the Minister&rsquo;s, to  the project has been regrettable. He could have been much more constructive and  forthcoming.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is very pleased with the Executive&rsquo;s decision  to allocate &pound;30 million to the Department of Justice to fund the fire and  rescue aspect of the Desertcreat training college. That major scheme can now  move ahead in the coming financial year. However, the Committee is very  concerned about reports in the media that the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety has indicated that he may not have the recurrent  funding for the running of the fire and rescue part of the college. The  Committee wants clarification of the position and confirmation that recurrent  funding will be available for the Fire and Rescue Service so that Desertcreat  training college can be fully operational.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Justice made no provision in its budget  proposals in 2011-12 or thereafter for any requirements that may arise from the  implementation of the Bamford review findings. The Committee has been advised  by departmental officials that the principle on which they are working is that  the lead Department, in this case the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, will make bids for any changes that are proposed as a result of  new legislation. Although the Committee is not yet in a position to make  decisions on whether it supports the detailed breakdown of the Department of  Justice budget, it supports the overall approach to the budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, in relation to the legal aid bill, there is some  confusion and considerable disappointment in the Committee that the figure that  the Committee understood was available as part of the Hillsborough agreement  was &pound;79 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We are now being told in the draft Budget proposals  that the figure that is allocated to the Legal Services Commission for 2014-15  could be &pound;75 million. The Committee has covered that in its submission on the  Department&rsquo;s budget. We wait with apprehension to hear the final outcome on  what that figure will be. Certainly, we always understood that it would be &pound;79  million and not &pound;75 million as we are now being told.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  First, I want to address some issues that relate to the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development. I serve as Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development. From the outset, the lack of  information has concerned me and, indeed, the Committee. I will give examples.  During the past week, a couple of issues emerged outside the Committee. We were  unaware and did not see that a proposal was hidden in the budget to remove  funding for the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster entirely. I declare an interest  as a former member, many years ago. My daughter was a recent member, although  she is not a member at present. I am, therefore, aware of how a relatively small  amount of seed funding results in the co-ordination of many volunteers who  carry out vital youth work in the rural community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another example that I noticed in the farming press at the  weekend is that funding to support agricultural shows has been reduced. Again,  the Committee did not see that proposal. I have reread the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, and no issue of that nature became apparent to me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Committee queried officials about the Young  Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster. They said that it is not a priority funding area and  that the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster did not teach recognised qualifications  such as NVQs. I argue that those clubs are a feeder unit to the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise  (CAFRE). We are already aware of the need for younger farmers, and the clubs  act as a feeder unit for future farmers. With increasingly fewer full-time  farmers, that is an area of opportunity. With the increase in world  agricultural food prices and value added to the economy by food processing,  there is a huge opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I declare an interest as I am still a member of the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of  Ulster. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I will probably have to leave  when I turn 30. I have a good four or five years yet.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it appropriate that Mr McCallister would  willingly mislead the House about his age?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I was just seeing whether anyone was stupid enough to believe me. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a serious note, I agree entirely with the Member&rsquo;s points  about the contribution that the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster have made to the  well-being of rural youth in Northern    Ireland. During the past 80 years, that  contribution has been immense. The one growth sector in the economy has been  the agrifood sector. It is the one light on the horizon in the economy. Those  proposals will feed into that and impact on training and skills throughout the  rural community. It is vital that we maintain that training and provide leaders  for the agriculture industry. I am sure that when the Minister of Finance and  Personnel meets leaders in the agrifood sector, many of them will have been  through the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster. We must fight to get a fair outcome  on that issue</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  will illustrate that with examples of what the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster  deliver, which, I believe, is important. They deliver stock judging  competitions. Young farmers and people in rural communities are trained how to  assess good qualities in animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs. If that did  not happen, that type of detailed training would not be provided by the  Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That happens at a very early age. There are other  activities, such as silage assessment and fencing competitions. I am not aware  of what happens elsewhere. Those who end up going to the agricultural colleges  may not learn those skills until later. Not all will reach agricultural  colleges, but, at the very least, the clubs are part of the feeder process of  encouraging young people into agriculture, to specialise in it and to learn the  best technical systems and values to take back from college to their home  farms.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  It is not only the young people in the agriculture and rural sector who are  adversely affected. Does the Member agree that young people and children right  across the North will be adversely impacted? The Children&rsquo;s Commissioner produced  her response to the draft Budget today. Does the Member agree with the  Commissioner&rsquo;s remark that she finds the lack of equality-proofing and due  regard for the equality of opportunity in the Budget proposals extremely  alarming? She also said that the spending proposals demonstrate that very  little account was taken to minimise or mitigate the potential adverse impact  on children and young people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The influence of the young farmers&rsquo; clubs extends beyond the farming community.  Many people in the rural community link into the young farmers&rsquo; clubs, many of  which are located in areas where there are no youth clubs or other activities.  As the activities are run entirely by volunteers, they are provided in an  efficient manner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member try to come back to the subject of the Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  is important funding for an activity that is similar to that offered by a  preschool facility. Would anyone dream of cutting preschool funding? The young  farmers&rsquo; activity is an early farming activity for young people and trains them  for the future. I view it as essential in that regard. In the past, its funding  has involved the relatively small sum of &pound;75,000 a year. However, when I look  through the detailed Budget, I see &pound;16 million listed against anti-poverty  measures. As there is no detail, I do not know how it is proposed that it will  be spent. Young farmers&rsquo; clubs feed into that area as well, because they  provide social activities in rural communities in which young people can become  involved and learn good techniques for farming in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was also alarmed to see a &pound;16 million commitment for a  new DARD headquarters. When we discussed the issue with officials, however, we  discovered that the value was &pound;32 million. That was hidden in the written  submission that we received from the Minister. She committed to &pound;16 million,  but, in fact, &pound;32 million is required towards that capital expenditure over a  longer period. It is much better if everything is open and transparent so that  people understand what is happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under recurrent capital expenditure for the four years, the  Minister indicates that there is &pound;2&middot;3 million for the Department; &pound;2&middot;8 million  for new equipment, etc, for the Forest Service; &pound;4&middot;1 million for the Rivers  Agency; and &pound;3&middot;3 million for CAFRE and AFBI. That is a total of &pound;12&middot;5 million.  However, there is a sting in the tail: the Minister says that that is only 50%  of what those services need during the period. She is, however, prepared to  commit &pound;16 million to a new structural building as headquarters for her civil  servants. Meanwhile, those who deliver essential services, such as the Forest  Service, the Rivers Agency, CAFRE and AFBI, will receive only 50% of what they  need. I question the wisdom of the Civil Service feeding money into itself  through building new headquarters. There must be other means of delivering that  so that we can prioritise delivering services on the ground. I question the  commitment of that &pound;16 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to wider issues. I am alarmed about the A5  road. Over the four years, some &pound;675 million, which is 60% of Roads Service&rsquo;s  capital budget for that period, is earmarked for that project. However, it does  not even have planning permission. The level of road usage is about 10,000  vehicles a day, which is not high. Another important factor is that the funding  is in the at-risk category, because the leader of the Irish Labour Party  clearly indicated that the supposed 50% funding from the Republic of Ireland  was in doubt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One can examine what some of the trade bodies have been  saying. I understand that the Road Haulage Association is saying that the A5  does not hit the top of its priority list of roads, bottlenecks and delays to  industry. It is not the priority, yet the Budget proposes committing 60% and  cutting lots of smaller schemes that can have a much bigger effect on the  economy. We must invest our money carefully to get the best results from it.  The A5 does not do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I am also aware  of concern among the local farming community. The Committee hopes to go to the  area later this week to view some of the issues ourselves. I fully accept that  there are areas of that road that need improvement and overtaking  opportunities, but would it not be better, at the very least, to investigate a  sectional approach if that has to happen to improve road safety on that road?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am minded of the experience of the A2 in my constituency,  which was in the headlines today. That road is a bottleneck. It has gone  through the entire planning process. Blighted property has to be bought by the  Department, though vesting has not yet started. Because &pound;4 million has been  spent on the planning process and in developing the scheme, which has been  granted planning permission, a further &pound;12 million had to be committed to  buying properties that have been blighted. Almost one third of the cost of that  scheme has been committed, and it is now proposed to put the scheme on hold. It  is apparent from the Budget that one reason for that is that the money will be  put into this one big basket, which, frankly, has lots of holes in it &mdash; the A5.  I argue that it would be much wiser to complete the many smaller projects  throughout the Province that are more advanced and will have a bigger effect on  our economy and on reducing congestion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The A2 in my own constituency is certainly one such  project. The accident and emergency department at Whiteabbey Hospital  has closed and people have to travel further. Ambulances have to come through  that congested route, and delays are occurring. The local police response  officers have actually been moved from Carrickfergus to Whiteabbey. Again,  there are delays. I do not understand why that issue has been wiped from the  planned programme. It was identified in the Belfast metropolitan area plan as  one of the top five priority areas but, with the stroke of a pen, the Minister  proposes to put it into cyberspace, leave all those blighted properties and  neighbours dangling there, uncertain of their future, and disrupt those  communities without finishing the job. I strongly argue that that route should  be finished.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having seen what happened in my own constituency with the A2,  I would take a look at the A5. I would not want to cause similar blight up  there. Huge disruption could potentially occur to communities there. We have  already learned of disruptions to farmers. What is the point in causing all  that disruption, causing blighting, and causing a requirement to invest money  in properties that have been blighted &mdash; the statutory process if we reach that  stage &mdash; if perhaps the money will not be available to complete the route?  Surely it would be much wiser to look at taking a sectional approach to deal  with overtaking opportunities or accident black spots, rather than to commit to  what would be the biggest capital roads investment that I have ever been aware  of in Northern Ireland  for a road with 10,000 vehicles a day. I understand that the A2 in my  constituency has about 30,000 vehicles a day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is not a good use of public money. In fact, it may  even endanger more public funding in a scheme that may never be delivered  should funding not be available, never mind within Northern   Ireland, but within the Republic of Ireland,  which has been linked up in partnership with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that is important is our transport  infrastructure. The east Antrim railway line is the only one that is largely  reliant on the older train sets. Thankfully, 20 new train sets were ordered and  are due for delivery from this month onwards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Wonderful, but those new trains will have to be  commissioned, and additional trains will mean that additional funding will be  required for their running costs. Will we have ordered trains to the value of  hundreds of millions of pounds and will they be on the road or will they be  parked in the garage? <em>[Interruption.]</em> That is, will they be on the railway line  or will they be parked in the garage?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important when we make investment that we think it  through and ensure that we are able to deliver on it. Mention was made about  not building buildings when you cannot staff them. Potentially, there is a  similar situation with public transport, so I seek reassurance that that will  not be the case. We must make careful use of our money so that our investment  can be delivered and improve things on the ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue in my constituency involves the health  sector. For Members&rsquo; information, East Antrim  has no accident and emergency or minor injury units. What we have in Taylors Avenue,  Carrickfergus is an ageing, overflowing health centre that is not fit for  modern standards and needs significant improvement. We have a building of a  similar age in Gloucester Avenue,  Larne, which has disability access issues. They put buckets out at times of  rain because the roof leaks. There are lots of problems with its layout and it  needs to be renewed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have suffered as a result of decisions on capital  investment priorities, in that Whiteabbey   Hospital&rsquo;s accident and  emergency unit has closed, as has the unit at Mid Ulster Hospital. The  Whiteabbey unit not being available is affecting my constituency by increasing  pressure on Antrim   Area Hospital.  I understand that improvements to the accident and emergency unit there are  planned or proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If investment also went into local health and care centres  in my constituency, which were just missed in the previous spending period, the  delivery of health services in my constituency could be improved. On top of  that, many people with minor ailments who go to major hospitals, such as Antrim Area Hospital or further afield, may well be able to be  assessed and dealt with in the local community, with pressure being taken off  the already burdened Antrim   Area Hospital.  I am arguing for joined-up thinking so that we prioritise our capital  expenditure and improvements can occur in some very outdated areas of the  health estate to improve the health of the people of East   Antrim, who have been badly dealt with over many decades.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  What discussions has the Member had with the Health Minister about those  issues?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  raised those issues with the Health Minister on a number of occasions. I am  aware that in deciding the overall capital budget, the Assembly has choices to  make. We can choose where we put our capital budget. Are health centres our  priority, or is it roads or headquarters for civil servants? There are choices  to be made and I vote that we should put money into improving basic, essential  services for the people. For the people of East Antrim,  that means improvements to our health centres in Larne and Carrickfergus.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Good morning, Mr Speaker. The SDLP understands that the Budget Bill is largely  the application of what has been handed down by the coalition Government.  However, trying to abdicate all responsibility shows a lack of leadership.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cuts of &pound;4 billion were envisaged for Northern Ireland  in the Chancellor&rsquo;s comprehensive spending review settlement. When we leave out  receipts and a rates increase, the draft Budget plans cuts of more than &pound;3&middot;2  billion. In other words, the Executive have succeeded in uncovering new revenue  equal to the cancellation of only a single road-building project. That shows a  lack of imagination and a lack of a fight for the people of this region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel  has withdrawn from the Chamber. The Finance Minister would never withdraw from  a debate on finance in the House and he does put in his hours here. It is  regrettable that his Committee Chairperson is unavailable to participate fully  in the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in saying that it is fighting Tory cuts is about as  credible as Gerry Adams&rsquo;s denial that he was ever in the IRA; it just does not  stack up. Unfortunately, nor does this Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP will not be part of a cosy DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in and,  since yesterday, Alliance Party consensus on cuts. Much more can be done to  raise funds that can be spent on job creation, job protection and front line  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In December, we published a detailed Budget plan,  &lsquo;Partnership and Economic Recovery&rsquo;, which we submitted to the Executive in the  hope of influencing the draft Budget. As colleagues have said, that was not our  first attempt at influencing the public finance debate in this region. It built  on a previous attempt in April 2009. We are not going to stop attempting to  influence public finances in this region. Our mandate is big enough to give us  a seat, if not two, at the Executive table by right, and Members should reflect  on that. We will continue to exercise our mandate on behalf of the people who  have voted for us and the many thousands &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Of course I will give way. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  That was a wee bit of a surprise, I must say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested to hear the Member state all the  contortions and distortions that his party has gone through to provide this  wonderful document, which seems to be the cure of all ills. It is a wonderful  document, but I must be truthful: I have not got round to reading it. I will  make a point of reading it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that the SDLP sent the document to the  Executive. Will the Member clarify, for those of us who are not as close to  this as he is, how it was delivered? Was it delivered by the Minister or by  post? Does he accept that his party has a Minister in the Executive, and did  that Minister not deliver for them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I commend the document to Lord Morrow. I know Lord Morrow from working with him  on the Justice Committee, and he is a very fine Chairperson of that Committee  and represents us very well in this House. Lord Morrow will know that I am very  committed to sustainability. In fact, I am one of the people who have put  themselves up for the paperless Committee system. I clarify that we e-mailed  the document to colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Partnership and Economic Recovery&rsquo; document includes  detailed proposals for new revenue streams and receipts and for cash-releasing  efficiency savings. We are pleased to see that the Executive have taken some of  our suggestions on board, many of which we have been highlighting, as I said  earlier, for nearly two years. Our document contains many more good ideas that  the Executive should consider, and we hope to continue a constructive  engagement through the Assembly and the Executive during the budgetary process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the draft Budget is simply not joined-up. Each  Department has had cuts imposed, and there has been little evidence of thinking  outside of departmental silos. The result is a Budget that has been generated  by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in private negotiation, rather than being collectively  agreed. It is a Budget that the Alliance Party seems willing to sign up to  pretty blindly. The SDLP believes that the experience gained &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. It would be helpful if the Member  clarified something. There seems to be two different arguments going on. One  argument is that the Budget is the product of a DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in carve-up, whereby  the two parties went off, within the Budget review committee, by themselves and  presented a fait accompli to the other Ministers. On the other hand, even  though it published its document at the eleventh hour &mdash; two months later than  every other party &mdash; the SDLP is saying that its fingerprints are on the draft  Budget, because all the good ideas in the document have been included in the  Budget. So, which version is it to be?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr Farry for giving me the opportunity to remind the House  that the document that we published last December was the second one that we  published in two years. I have a copy of the first here that I am happy to pass  around the Chamber, and we can refer to it during the course of the day. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>I know that the Minister of Finance and  Personnel has enjoyed referring to it in the past, but he may wish to refresh  his memory.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The document that we published in April 2009 includes many  of the provisions in this year&rsquo;s Budget that we are able to welcome. However,  there is no getting away from the simple fact that the draft Budget before the  House is a carve-up, and a carve-up for political reasons. Fair play to the DUP  and Sinn F&eacute;in, because those parties have the numbers to get the Budget through  the House, and I wish them good luck with that mission. What I cannot  understand &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Perhaps the Member will explain where he gets the  idea of there being a carve-up, because there is as much fantasy in that  assertion as there is in some of the stuff that is in his document. The budgets  that were most generously treated in the draft Budget were those for DHSSPS and  DEL, neither  of which are DUP or Sinn F&eacute;in Departments. Indeed, the Member&rsquo;s colleague Mr  O&rsquo;Loan, who is sitting behind him and who will probably put his head down in a  minute or two, complained last night that the budget for DCAL, which is a  DUP-controlled Ministry, was one of the worst hit. Where is the evidence of a  carve-up?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I had the opportunity to listen to the radio this morning. I shall not mention  the broadcaster&rsquo;s name, because it is mentioned too many times in the House. On  that programme, John Simpson, who is a senior economist and who, for the  record, I do not believe votes for the SDLP, pointed out that DHSSPS is a loser  in the draft Budget and DEL  a major loser. It is not my job as an SDLP MLA to defend colleagues and another  party&rsquo;s Ministers, but that was in evidence in what Mr Simpson said, in the  report that was published by Queen&rsquo;s University last week and in the  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) report. With the indulgence of the Speaker, the Minister  and the House, I will return to that issue a little later.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the reason why the SDLP is so angry about the draft  Budget is not on behalf of the Department for which its Minister has the  portfolio but because those who are most vulnerable, disadvantaged and  marginalised will remain so if the Budget is carried through as it stands?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The great tragedy of today&rsquo;s debate is that those who are suffering are not in  the House. Those people are working families and are the most marginalised in  our community. At the end of my remarks, I will take some time to try to  evidence that to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also problems with the process. The SDLP believes  that the experience gained from the outworking of the current Budget, and the  serious impact of many outside factors over the four-year period, highlights  the need for the flexibility of a full annual Budget process, combined with a  long-term strategic economic plan. In order to best manage our finances,  provide sound planning and allow for transparency and accountability, we cannot  rely on a Budget document that is years out of date. That will prove to be the  case again, as there is a marked absence of medium- and long-term thinking in  the four-year draft Budget, for which there is no accompanying Programme for  Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Now that we have relative stability in government, we must  move on from short-fix, short-term politics and, I must add, the politics of  the peace process. I am sick and tired of hearing Members, who are my  colleagues, try to excuse every failing of regional government as a consequence  of our transitional status. My generation do not consider themselves to have  transitional status; rather, they feel that they are part of a region with a  devolved Government, and they want that Government to work for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult to assess the objectives of the draft  Budget, as it is not based on an up-to-date Programme for Government. Although  it has been touted as a great four-year plan, without a strategic Programme for  Government, it is a short-term fix. Any argument that the 2008 Programme for  Government is an acceptable strategy on which to build the draft Budget is  totally flawed. We need a new Programme for Government on which to base a  proper four-year Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I think that he has mentioned the absence of  a new Programme for Government three times in the past couple of minutes. Does  he not accept the point that was made yesterday that we are discussing a Budget  in the final few weeks of the current mandate and that the time for the  consideration of a new Programme for Government will be in around 10 weeks, not  at the end of this mandate?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Mr Campbell makes a very good point. However, it was his colleague the Minister  of Finance and Personnel, Mr Sammy Wilson MP MLA, who, in answer to a question  for written answer to my party leader, Margaret Ritchie, a couple of weeks ago  said, and I quote &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member must be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Mr Wilson wrote:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The ideal situation would be to have the draft  Programme for Government published at the same time as, or in advance of, the  draft Budget.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The 2008 Programme for Government was published  before the economic downturn. Although we accept the fact that it makes the  economy the number one priority, the outlook has changed so radically that  businesses and jobseekers have different needs now than in 2008.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a recent speech to the Northern Ireland Assembly and  Business Trust (NIABT) &mdash; a speech that I was able to listen to personally &mdash; Mr  Wilson said that we will not really know the impact of this Budget until we are  well into year 4. That admission proves that the Budget is not a precise  document and Northern    Ireland needs a Programme for Government to  accompany it, otherwise we are being asked to put a few pounds on at fairly  long odds. Those of us in the House who are betting men and women would never  do such a thing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It begs an important question: how can the public have  confidence in the Budget when the Finance Minister is unable to predict its  impact? It is not just us who are saying that. The Northern Ireland Council for  Voluntary Action&rsquo;s (NICVA) response to the budgetary process raised serious  questions about the process and the Budget itself. NICVA&rsquo;s budget submission  concludes:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;At present this is not a balanced Budget. At this  stage, and with reference to the published information, it is not clear how two  major spending Departments &mdash; certainly DHSSPS and possibly DEL &mdash; will balance the books. The outcome of  this may hold important implications for other Departments.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">While some revenue raising is proposed, more  imaginative funding mechanisms, savings and revenue-raising programmes and  projects might have been suggested.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">It is less than ideal that a Budget is to be agreed before  a new Programme for Government is in place.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The indications in this Budget do not tell us if the  Executive has an adequate response to many of the challenges facing Northern Ireland,  e.g. rising unemployment and a rebalancing of energy use and the economy  towards renewables&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I know that that is a difficult one for the  Minister. However, it is still part of the Programme for Government &mdash; the old  one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget can also be measured against its potential  impact on the economy, yet all the economic commentators recognise the need to  balance the Northern Ireland  economy. That means growing our private sector and getting a more efficient  public sector. It means focusing on job creation and investing scarce capital  in the right areas. A Budget is one of the key levers available to the Northern  Ireland Executive in enabling that change, yet the draft Budget and the Budget  Bill fail to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget fails to prioritise economic development  and contains little economic stimulus to generate jobs in the short term and to  get the economy moving. It provides no proposals to move assets and activities  from the public sector to the private sector, and it provides no serious  aspirations for public sector reform. In large part, that is because the  Executive are working to a Programme for Government that is now three years out  of date. The only proposal for economic stimulus in the draft Budget &mdash; the  green new deal &mdash; lacks ambition and the funding to match. In the SDLP&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Partnership and Economic Recovery&rsquo;, we begin to tackle those issues, and we  will continue to encourage others to do so as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget is hugely ambitious, and there are  questions over how robust the claims are around additional finance being  raised. Initial suggestions were that we would get &pound;1&middot;5 billion new money &mdash; new  revenue &mdash; from the Budget. Those suggestions came from the Minister for  Regional Development in a briefing about 48 hours before the draft Budget was  proposed. However, they disappeared like snow off a ditch, and we are now  talking of a figure of &pound;800 million, but that cannot be quantified either. The  SDLP is concerned about the low level of new revenue that will be raised in the  draft Budget. When normal receipts are stripped away, there is little new  money: less than 1% of the total Budget. The Minister may have described this  Budget as a:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;good Christmas present for the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and it may have nice wrapping, but the box is  pretty empty.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He has clearly articulated what Stephen  Farry has suggested: the Budget is full of holes. Is that a description with  which the Member agrees?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike the SDLP, the Alliance Party has given the Budget  its full support. Mr Farry argued that any party that does not support the  carve-ups arrived at by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in should leave the Executive.  However, since the Alliance Party does not support another DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in carve  up, namely the cohesion, sharing and integration (CSI) strategy, will it leave  the Executive? Members will recall that the only reason why the Alliance Party  condescended to take the Justice Ministry was on the basis that a cohesion,  sharing and integration strategy would be published. Now that strategy has been  rubbished; it will not now appear in this mandate. Should the Alliance Party  not consider its position in the Executive?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The question stands.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way, and I am grateful to him for facilitating the  debate. Is Dolores Kelly asking the Alliance Party to jump out of the Executive  before the SDLP, if that is what the SDLP intends to do?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us be clear. The devolution of policing and justice has  been an outstanding success over the past year. An extremely difficult  political issue that almost brought down the Assembly has been stabilised. We  are now seeing delivery, and I would not belittle that for one moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have had more progress on cohesion, sharing and  integration over the past year than we have ever had during any previous  mandate, including when the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP were allegedly  running this place. As for any carve-up, we have been clear that this Budget  was negotiated by five parties, including the SDLP. That party cannot point the  finger at the Executive because the Executive is the SDLP inasmuch as it is any  of the five parties in this Chamber. The Executive is a collective effort.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The question stands for the SDLP: when Alex Attwood votes  against the Budget at the Executive, but is then bound by collective  responsibility to defend that Budget, will the SDLP have one version of the  party in the Executive saying one thing, and another version outside saying  another?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am tempted, Mr Speaker, to depart from the Bill to go back to the question of  the CSI strategy. However, I am sure that you would pull me up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting that, in these islands, liberal parties  seem to be making a habit of doing a bad deal as they enter government.  Colleagues in Mr Farry&rsquo;s sister party sold themselves into government for a  referendum that they will lose, and the Alliance Party sold itself into  government for a cohesion, sharing and integration strategy that is the  laughing stock of the community relations sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. Talking of sister parties, why is  this nation in the mess that it is in, with respect to economic and fiscal  policy? It is because of the sister party that the SDLP props up at Westminster. The SDLP  sits on the Labour Party Benches.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  So do you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  The SDLP supported the Labour Party through thick and thin, and that party left  this country in the economic mess that it is now in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Please address all remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am always curious to know why the DUP is unable to get a sister party  anywhere. Maybe that is the way that it prefers it. I will return to the Bill,  but I will give way first.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I am refreshed to hear DUP Members laying the  blame where it belongs, with the Labour Party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will return the Member to the Bill. Is he not a little  unfair about revenue raising? He may have forgotten about Daith&iacute;&rsquo;s plastic bag  tax.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Serendipity, Mr Speaker. I was about to review the holes in the Budget that Mrs  Kelly referred to on the revenue-raising side. The draft Budget anticipates  &pound;146 million in rates increases over four years, yet Minister Wilson championed  a rates freeze. It expects us to realise &pound;442 million in capital receipts over  four years. Let us face it: this is not new money; it has been accounted for in  previous departmental budgets. It is funny money, Mr Speaker. I know that the  Minister likes to be a comedian at times, but he is a serious man when it comes  to being a Minister, and he knows that, too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget anticipates &pound;100 million in receipts from  the central asset management unit (CAMU). However, CAMU failed to raise any  funds in the past four years. The draft Budget expects &pound;23 million this year in  capital carried over from 2010-11 to 2011-12. That was announced in the  December monitoring round. However, that money is carried over; it is not new.  There is &pound;4 million in the plastic bag levy that Mr McCallister mentioned. I  put that question to the Minister of the Environment in the House last week.  Surely the point of the plastic bag levy is to reduce reliance on plastic bags,  and, therefore, its success will raise no money.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. I will try to move the debate on to  revenue raising. I would be grateful if the Member could clarify when the SDLP  will come off the fence and be clear about the need to introduce water charges  in Northern Ireland.  Water charges are being paid everywhere else in the UK, and we cannot sustain levels of  public services here without generating the same levels of revenue that are  generated elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note, in particular, that the SDLP has now called  publicly for the mutualisation of Northern Ireland Water. I agree with him, and  I am glad that we have found some common ground on the issue. However, the SDLP  is not being fully honest in accepting the logic of its arguments, because the  mutualisation of Northern Ireland Water means that it becomes, essentially,  self-financing. That means that a separate charge has to be raised from the  public. Therefore, calling for mutualisation means calling for separate water  charges. That is the right way to go, but the SDLP should be brave and say  that, in doing so, we will bring in &pound;200 million a year that will transform the  situation that we are in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr Farry, because I was going to return to that matter later,  and I will do so. Mutualisation does not equal water charges. I do not want to  have to explain the concept of mutualisation. However, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd suggested that  mutualisation was privatisation, but it is actually the opposite. My advice to  Mr O&rsquo;Dowd is to look it up in the dictionary. A mutual company is owned by its  customers. The customers of Northern Ireland Water are the people of this  region. Mutualisation would be the model that would guarantee public ownership  of that utility, not privatise it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mutualisation requires that there be a certain and steady  income stream. It does not mean that we have to raise that income through water  charges. We could continue to subsidise Northern Ireland Water, as we do today,  out of the block grant, and we could mutualise it. We could do lots of other  things. My party will not be going to the people to surrender on an issue on  which we have stood fast, which is that people should not pay a separate water  charge in this region as things stand today. We are not going to resile from  that position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Clearly, the Member is totally confused about the  way in which Northern Ireland Water could raise money. If the idea behind  mutualisation is to ensure that Northern Ireland Water can borrow money to pay  for the infrastructure, it can do that only against a guaranteed income stream.  If the borrowing is against a guaranteed income stream from the public sector,  the Member knows well &mdash; or, at least, he would know well if he has done his  homework &mdash; that once that guarantee becomes a Government guarantee, any  borrowing is measured against our block grant and we lose it. The only source  of income that would not allow the Treasury to take borrowing from our block  grant would be from a source that is independent of Government guarantee. As Mr  Farry and others pointed out, that is why mutualisation will require some  charging of the customer if we are to raise money against it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will continue the point, and I am grateful to the Minister for raising it. In  the Chamber last night &mdash; it was late &mdash; the Minister questioned a lot of the  SDLP&rsquo;s borrowing proposals. He basically said that, if we seek to borrow, we  hit the block. This is another example of the view that Treasury rules do not  allow us to borrow because there are Barnett consequentials and block  consequentials. However, that is not quite true. We borrow &pound;200 million a year  from the block under RRI. We can get Treasury to agree to exceptions. In fact,  in the past three months, we proposed to borrow &pound;175 million for the  Presbyterian Mutual Society, which will not score against our block. The  Minister is, of course, technically correct that, if we were to try to do it  without seeking an exception, we would subject ourselves to a bit of a problem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: Will  the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  No, hold on a second. Let me finish the point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is nothing to say that we could not go back to  Treasury with a properly costed, properly proposed scheme that, in the same way  as with the RRI or the Presbyterian Mutual Society, would allow us to raise  revenue and guarantee an income stream for a mutual without breaching Treasury  guidelines. The guidelines could be changed, as they have been changed often.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member clarify for the House how many special exemptions Northern Ireland  will go to the Treasury to appeal? We are in a very difficult financial  situation. The coalition Government want to normalise politics across the UK as far as  possible. We have negotiated the PMS settlement. We are negotiating for special  exemptions on corporation tax. There is also an ongoing battle regarding  end-year flexibility. How on earth will we go to the Treasury and say that we  want flexibility in the governance arrangements for Northern Ireland Water?  Everyone else in the UK pays  for their water through a separate charge, but we, in Northern Ireland,  will opt out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While I am on my feet, may I also ask the Member to clarify  why, as a so-called social democratic party, the SDLP is playing a right-wing,  populist card by refusing to bite the bullet on progressive revenue raising to  properly fund public services? The SDLP is trying to have it both ways.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  We have got used to Mr Farry propping up the consensus on the cuts coalition of  Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, but he is now a surrender monkey to the Con-Dem  coalition in London.  This Assembly should except itself from United Kingdom arrangements every  bleeding week. We cannot have too many exceptions for our region. We cannot do  enough our own way. We will make no apology for seeking further exemptions if  it is in the best interests of the people of this region, the finances of the  Executive and the Assembly and our major investment needs. Our answer to  everything does not have to be, &ldquo;Och, we could not do that. Sure, the rules do  not allow it&rdquo;. It just beggars belief.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he agree that the position outlined by  Mr Farry and the Minister, which effectively implies that people here do not  contribute to the revenue stream of Northern Ireland Water at the minute, is  exactly the same lie as is pedalled by the British Treasury? That has to be  dispelled and resisted. All householders here know that they contribute to a  revenue stream for water every year through their rates bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Many colleagues, particularly those in office in the House, will know that the SDLP  has made that argument inside and outside the Executive for heading on for a  decade.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Given that the Member was a special adviser at the time, he may well recall  that, in the past, there was a formal link between the regional rate and water,  which was broken by the then SDLP Finance Minister. People now pay for an  element of their water through the regional rate. I think that that has been  assessed at &pound;160 a household. However, that does not cover the full cost of  providing a water service. Although people pay for an element, they do not pay  the full cost of what is required to run Northern Ireland Water. It is  important that people understand the sums on this matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will indulge the House with a clarification on that matter because, in a  previous role, I was party to some of the decisions taken in the Executive at that  time. I assure Mr Farry that Mr Mark Durkan did not break the link when he was  Finance Minister. In fact, that is the problem. The breaking of the link and  the change took place after the Assembly had been suspended. That is why the  SDLP continues to believe that we can deliver on our RRI commitments and the  other major capital investment programmes through a rateable process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the holes in the Budget. Some &pound;20 million a  year has been identified as coming from housing association reserves. However,  there is no ability to recoup that money from the associations. The total new  revenue claimed in the draft Budget is &pound;807 million. However, the true  potential is only &pound;262 million. It is not me saying that; a senior official  from the Department of Finance and Personnel said so, on 12 January 2011, to  the Committee for Finance and Personnel. As colleagues can see, the supposed  &pound;842 million in new revenue is questionable to say the least, as is, in  particular, the &pound;442 million already planned by Departments. In fact, the  majority of it comes from DSD and is merely the repayment of Housing Executive  debt. It is not a new source of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In our document, we found many additional revenue-raising  opportunities that we have not seen incorporated into the draft Budget. That  means that we have less money to spend. In fact, the SDLP&rsquo;s ideas bridge the  entire funding gap in the draft Budget. Our fully costed document &lsquo;Partnership  and Economic Recovery&rsquo; &mdash; it is available, although some Members last night  seemed to think that it was not &mdash; provides detailed figures for our proposals.  It is available in the Library and online, and I will send Members a link to it  on Twitter if that will make it easier for them. It is not exactly a secret  document.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report provides detailed figures for the following SDLP  proposals, none of which is in the draft Budget: the resizing of the Executive  information service; the scrapping of departmental management boards; car park  charging for the Senior Civil Service; the establishment of the Education and  Skills Authority; the increase in public sector productivity; reductions in  public service expenses and overseas travel; the leasing of Forest Service  lands; the abolition of junior ministerial posts &mdash; I am sorry if any of the  junior Ministers are in the Chamber at the moment; reforming the Northern  Ireland Prison Service; a public service pay cut of 5%; procurement savings; a  single economic policy unit; restructuring quangos; reviewing university costs;  cutting public sector advertising; a supermarket off-licence levy; scrapping  the Focus Farms scheme; reducing legal aid costs; a rates increase for banks  and ATMs; a levy on telephone masts; an MOT charge increase; fast-track  planning charges; Northern Ireland Housing Executive interest reprofiling; a  shared future investment bond &mdash;I think that I have dealt with the points that  the Minister raised in the House last night about borrowing in this region,  which we can come back to if he wishes; the sale and leaseback of the Northern  Ireland Housing Executive headquarters; the agricultural college receipt and &mdash;  I apologise, Mr Speaker &mdash; the sale of your house on this estate too; the sale  of allotments; the privatisation of the Rate Collection Agency; the deferral of  non-priority projects; the planning gain developer contribution to local  government borrowing; the long-term borrowing; other capital realisation asset  sales; the sale of Derry port and airport; and the privatisation of Belfast  port, to mention just a few.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The initial delay in publishing the draft Budget has had  the knock-on effect of limiting the ability of outside organisations to give a  considered response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member read, at some rate, a fairly long list &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: He did not want us to think too much about it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  That is the point, exactly. Does the Member accept that the glaring omissions  from that long list are measures that would realise monetary efficiencies and  deliver much more effective government in Northern Ireland? They would  involve dismantling what his former party leader called the ugly scaffolding of  Stormont: doing away with Departments and saving money in the process;  encouraging more efficient working within the new Departments; and getting rid  of a considerable number of MLAs and saving money, never mind about getting rid  of the Speaker&rsquo;s house or the junior Minister posts. Will he concede that those  are glaring omissions from his lengthy list of measures, or is he more  concerned about the effect that they might have on the SDLP?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am grateful for the Member&rsquo;s intervention. It is like the story of the bad  tradesman who blames his tools; if only he had better tools, he could do a  better job. It is not the system that is broken around here, it is the  politics. Bad politics, not a bad system, has given us a bad Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will give way in a second.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We could have delivered this draft Budget through good  politics months ago, and it could have led to a great consultation and proper  scrutiny by Committees, not the accelerated passage of an important Bill. But,  no; what are we doing? We are playing bad politics in a system that would, if  we chose to work it, be capable of transforming this region.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Is the Member seriously trying to convince the House that this system of  government is effective, given that, in many respects, it is the same system  that was there between 1999 and 2002-03, when his party and the UUP were in  lead positions, and the First Minister David Trimble and the Deputy First  Minister Mark Durkan did not even speak to each other? Is he trying to tell us  that that was an effective system? Admittedly, David Trimble&rsquo;s party colleagues  would not even speak to him at that time. However, is the Member seriously  trying to say that the system of government that was in place then and is in  place now was effective at that time simply because different people headed it  up? The system is wrong, and it prevents us &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  You were in it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member who is commenting from a sedentary position is right. I did not  speak to him because of all the stuff that he was up to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Is the Member seriously trying to say that this cumbersome five-party mandatory  coalition is the best system of government for Northern   Ireland and the one that the people of Northern Ireland  deserve?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  It is the system that an overwhelming majority of people voted for. I accept  that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Let me just finish. I accept that the DUP rejected that system, and I respect  it for that. I understand why DUP colleagues find it difficult to be at the  helm of a system that the DUP actively opposes. However, the truth of the matter  is that it is its system, too. If done right, the system would be capable of  transforming this region. What signal does it send out to the outside world  when we spend our time blaming our tools instead of looking to ourselves, to  our politics, to our culture, to our attitude and to the fact that we could  have produced a draft Budget in September, if not in early October? We could  have done this right. [Interruption.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The issue is not a broken system; the issue is broken politics in the big two  parties. Mr Speaker, if it is OK with you and colleagues, I would not mind  finishing my contribution before lunch. I have only &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I have only 18 minutes left so, with Members&rsquo; indulgence, I will plough on for  a little bit, and then I will happily engage in a few interventions. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The issue that goes to the heart of Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s point is the transparency of  the system and the politics at the heart of it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The initial delay in publishing the draft Budget has had  the knock-on effect of limiting the ability of outside organisations to provide  considered responses. That delay has also had a further detrimental effect on departmental  planning, resulting in an even shorter timescale for departmental consultations  and a lack of detail in the departmental spending plans we have seen. Moreover,  we are left with this ridiculous scenario where the Vote on Account, the first  stage of the Budget process in the Assembly, and the Second Stage of the Bill  come before the end of the consultation period. It is bizarre. The lack of  detail in spending plans further limits the process&rsquo;s transparency and creates  further difficulty and confusion for those wishing to respond properly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are four ways in which we could improve transparency  in the Budget process. First, we could change the Budget to highlight specific  spending on front line services. Secondly, we could require each Minister to  make a statement to the Assembly on their budget proposals. Thirdly, we could  ask all Ministers to open their individual departmental budget plans to  Executive colleagues for collective scrutiny. I note that the Chairperson of  the Committee for Finance and Personnel has yet to respond to my intervention  about his opinion on that matter. Fourthly, as I said, we could establish an  Assembly Budget review group to interrogate the cost of government in a similar  vein to the Executive Budget review group.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has significant concerns that the Budget will lead  to a reduction in the scrutiny of government. The huge cuts to the Northern  Ireland Assembly secretariat and the Audit Office and the scrapping of the  Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland will have significant  implications for the ability of independent bodies to provide options and  alternatives and to counterbalance the Executive. A reduction in the funds  available means that there is a greater need for scrutiny of spending  performance and delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the SDLP has shown, through its fully costed  Budget document, that there are further sources of funding available, we  believe that there is still scope to provide additional funds in specific areas  in order to create jobs, to defend vulnerable people and to protect front line  services. The cuts being dealt by the Executive Budget will create up to 9,000  job losses. That is not my figure; it is the opinion of outside bodies. Figures  from the Regional Health and Social Care Board chief executive, John Compton,  suggest the possibility of 4,000 jobs going in the Health Service. INTO, the  teachers&rsquo; organisation, suggests that as many as 4,500 jobs could go in the  education sector. Already, 213 firm redundancies are planned at Belfast Metropolitan College.  The Department of the Environment is predicting 300 job losses over four years.  The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is predicting that 80 jobs  will have to go in the next four years. The SDLP believes that, if the Budget  was well managed, there should be no need for compulsory redundancies.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget will also have serious implications for the  future provision of health services. Alongside potential job losses,  predictions are being made that the cuts will limit patient access to new  drugs, have a hugely negative effect on social care provision, effect hospital  closures and mean that a lack of finance will be available to finalise new  projects such as the Altnagelvin cancer unit. There is no point building a  cancer unit if we cannot staff it. What signal does that send to the people in  the north-west of our region and to colleagues and neighbours in Donegal and  the border counties?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP understands the inflationary nature of the health  budget due to an ageing population, demographic changes and the cost of new  drugs and technologies. We accept that there are opportunities for reform and  savings within the health budget. However, we believe that the Health Minister  and Finance Minister must work with their Executive colleagues to ensure that  significant changes are made to the Budget to end uncertainty and guarantee the  protection of front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget fails to provide clarity on student  finance, student fees or the education maintenance allowance. Worryingly,  however, the draft Budget includes a 21% cut in funding for the Department for  Employment and Learning in 2012-13, the year in which the new university  charging regime, as voted for in Westminster, is due to come into force. Maybe,  during his winding-up speech, the Minister of Finance and Personnel will  clarify his personal position on student fees. I read the Hansard report from  the House of Commons on 10 December. I give the Minister full credit: he stood  up and made a fine contribution, expressing his opposition to increased student  fees.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Just in case I forget, I want to remind &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I would rather that you waited until your winding-up speech. However, as you  were generous to me, I will give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Given that the Member has read the Hansard report, I  am sure that he will be absolutely clear on my position, and I know that the  Member who spoke from his own party made exactly the same point. I believe that  we should not have a system that rules out people who could benefit from higher  education from having that opportunity because of their inability to pay and  fear of student debt. However, I made it very clear that, given the Barnett  consequential that had been handed down to the Executive before the House of  Commons had even made its decision, our room for manoeuvre and that of the  Scottish representatives was severely limited by a financial decision that had  been made at Westminster. Therefore, if the student fees decision went through  the House of Commons and there was to be a financial consequence for devolved  Administrations, it would have to be factored in to any decision and was bound  to be a limiting factor in any freedom of movement and choice when it came to  making decisions here. That was the position that I stated, and that is why I  voted against the increase in fees in the House of Commons. I believed that  that was the place to stop it. However, once that decision went through, there  was a financial consequence for us. The Member&rsquo;s party, as well as my party,  the Ulster Unionist Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance Party, will have to work  out how we address those financial consequences.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s clarification on that matter. However, let him  never again come to the House and say that he opposes Tory cuts. He has just  said that he accepts them and that, having lost the vote in the House of  Commons, he is now happy as a devolved Minister to deliver them. Let him nail  that lie this afternoon, tonight or whenever he gets a chance to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not know whether the Member is having  difficulty. I cannot speak Spanish, and perhaps he does not understand my  English. Let me make it clear to him again that, if there is a financial  consequence, this House as a whole has to decide how to live with that. I have  not heard any credible explanation of how we live with the impact of something  that we voted against but which is imposed on us and, therefore, limits our  freedom of action. I have not yet heard the SDLP explain how it would live with  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Member that a similar situation was faced when  his party had the employment and learning Ministry. That was exactly the point  that it made: we have to live with the Budget that we have and must impose a  &pound;3,000 fee on students. Let us not forget &mdash; he seems to have done so &mdash; that  fees for students in Northern    Ireland were introduced by the SDLP and not  by the Minister who now heads the Department for Employment and Learning.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  This is the second time in two days that we have heard erroneous claims from  the DUP Benches about what a previous SDLP Minister did when responsible for  higher education. It is not the case that an SDLP Minister introduced fees, and  even the figures that are being suggested about what applied at the time, the  previously imposed figures, are inaccurate. I think that Members on the DUP  Benches should &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Finance  and Personnel</strong>: Who introduced them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  The DUP should consult the history books. Look on Google, Minister, and you  will find out. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>I am not in a position  to give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  There is a bigger issue here. The Minister let the cat out of the bag about the  flaw in the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in approach to the Budget process when he said that  the House had to live with the cuts imposed by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. We  do not have to live with it; the real question is how we deal with it. We have  put forward proposals to deal with it and bridge the gap, and it is time that  the Minister and others on the Executive met that ambitious challenge.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr Callaghan for that intervention. I think that he addressed the  Minister&rsquo;s points, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have not honestly reprioritised the capital  programme in housing either. Instead &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  No. Instead, they have just spread the pain around. There is no capital  spending programme &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  No capital spending programme does more to stimulate jobs, reduce poverty and  meet important social policy objectives than investment in social housing, but  the Executive have overseen a 40% cut in the newbuild housing budget without  any attempt to find money elsewhere. On top of that, the draft Budget proposals  would take an overly ambitious &pound;80 million from housing association reserves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is incredible that the Department of Education has been  allowed to become one of the biggest losers in this Budget process. Alongside  the potential for up to 4,500 job losses, as many as 100 schools face the  prospect of having building works cancelled. Again, the Budget provides little  clarity, and it is not yet certain which schools will be affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Research from the Trades Union Congress shows that low- and  middle-income families will be an average of &pound;2,700 a year worse off by 2013.  In addition, in 2013, the coalition Government in London will replace tax credits and benefits  with the universal credit system, which will mean further hardship. The  Executive cannot mitigate these changes, but the Budget does not do nearly  enough. The social protection fund that the SDLP proposed to ensure that the  most vulnerable members of our society could be protected from Westminster welfare cuts has been adopted for  only one year. That is hugely disappointing and means that, by 2012, thousands  of vulnerable people, many of them with disabilities, will face benefit cuts.  It is imperative that the social protection fund is extended over the lifetime  of this Budget if it is to be credible as a progressive measure to tackle  poverty in this region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is also dismayed that the Executive see fit to  impose a pay freeze on over 10,000 low- and lower-middle-income civil servants,  approximately 7,400 of whom can be classed as earning below the average  industrial wage. I ask colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in to reflect on that. They are asking  7,400 people who earn less than the wage they take home to take a pay freeze.  That is not just. They are asking the lowest to pay for the sins of the few.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The social investment fund causes us much concern. Despite  such shortfalls in funding for health, education, student finance and housing,  the draft Budget provides &pound;80 million for a new Sinn F&eacute;in-DUP community fund to  be targeted at their selected and preferred groups. OFMDFM&rsquo;s social investment  fund for interface communities is politically driven and was not discussed by  the full Executive before it was announced. The proposal lacks definition. If  it were truly aimed at tackling disadvantage, such money would be better spent  on enhancing the delivery of existing Department for Social Development programmes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat. I thank the Member for giving way. Those most deprived  communities may happen to be in west Belfast  or the Shankill. Does the Member not realise that what we hear from the SDLP  about the social investment fund and the social protection fund is almost a  repetition of what the SDLP said many years ago when it supported political  vetting? That resulted in groups like Conway Mill in west Belfast  and Dove House in Derry being adversely  affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The social investment fund is crucial. Had you listened to  the First Minister and deputy First Minister when they explained to the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister how  the social investment fund would be targeted at the most deprived areas and how  the social protection fund would be targeted at people who needed it most, you  would see that, on the basis of objective need, such a fund is absolutely  crucial. Trying to describe it in the manner in which you and your SDLP  colleagues have done does an absolute disservice to the people in our  community, particularly those in the most deprived communities, who need those  resources to assist them. Your analysis is wrong to arrive at that conclusion.  The people in Dove House and Conway Mill have long memories of your position on  political vetting and where it affected people most, which was in the most  deprived republican areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  That was an amazing contribution from Ms Anderson. I agree with a tiny bit of  what she said: those most on the margins of our community need most support.  However, there is no logic whatsoever in the point made. If, in the past, there  were failed British Government schemes that were politically driven &mdash; schemes  that the SDLP had no part in, spent a lot of time opposing and has no truck  with defending &mdash; why would Sinn F&eacute;in try to manufacture its own politically  motivated centralised scheme? If it were seriously a scheme to tackle  deprivation and marginalisation, why would we not have discussed it around the Executive  table properly and in advance, and why would you not give it to the Department  for Social Development for delivery?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he agree that the neighbourhood renewal  scheme is there precisely to fulfil the purpose of targeting disadvantage in  the most impoverished areas of the North of Ireland? I was flabbergasted at my  Foyle colleague&rsquo;s contribution. She specified who should be the potential  beneficiaries of the scheme when nobody knows what the scheme&rsquo;s criteria are.  Everything is a total mystery. What she said only adds weight to suspicions  among many groups, including those in what she would probably describe as  republican areas, that the scheme is a crony list in waiting that was set up by  Sinn F&eacute;in and bowed down to by the DUP and its new allies in the Alliance  Party, which, previously, was the moral guardian of fiscal rectitude but now  seems happy to sign up to anything at all for the sake of one ministerial seat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr Callaghan for that point.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Did Mr Callaghan give an example of political vetting by suggesting that there  are Sinn F&eacute;in crony organisations somewhere?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The point that is being made is that we know that, when there has been  political interference &mdash; alleged or actual, on this island and in other places  &mdash; in community programmes, their delivery has been bad.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Let me just finish this point, Mr McCartney.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that, and our history is littered with examples of  it. Indeed, our party was founded to campaign against it, and, I suggest, our  party has the proudest record in the House of doing just that. We must not  repeat the mistakes of the past in this Budget. I am putting down a marker to say  that, if it walks like and looks like a big mistake, it could be a big mistake.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the British Government stopped the funding for  Conway Mill as a direct result of a call from a former member of the SDLP who,  at the time, was a serving Belfast  city councillor?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Unfortunately, I have to interrupt the Member, because we are coming up  to lunchtime, and, as most Members know, the Business Committee has arranged to  meet immediately on the lunchtime suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of  the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm, when it will be Question  Time. After Question Time, we will come back to the Second Stage of the Budget  Bill, when Mr Conall McDevitt will, once again, be on his feet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.31 pm.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="a3" id="a3"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Employment and Learning</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Apprenticeships</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans he has  to increase participation in apprenticeship schemes. (AQO 1050/11<a name="AQO1050/11" id="AQO1050/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Mr Kennedy)</strong>: Apprenticeships are key to developing  workforce skills in Northern    Ireland now and in the future. Therefore, I  am determined to protect the provision for young people in the 16-year-old to  24-year-old category, despite the difficult economic context. Apprenticeships  depend on an employer employing a person and encouraging them to undertake the  training that is laid out in apprenticeship frameworks. My Department meets the  full cost of apprentice-directed training. That can range from &pound;2,600 to  &pound;10,800 per person, depending on the level of study, the occupational area and  the progression of the individual through the apprenticeship framework. On  completion, an incentive ranging from &pound;500 to &pound;1,500 is also paid to the  employer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In considered funding for apprenticeships, I had a  difficult choice to make regarding the 16-to-24 and 25-plus categories.  Apprenticeships are an important career path for individuals and strengthen the  regional economy. However, the potential withdrawal of funding for those over  25 will protect those career paths for the young people who have been most  affected by the economic recession. It is worth noting that the Scottish and  Welsh Governments have limited the places available for adult apprenticeships,  and that England  applies a reduced funding rate. In those jurisdictions, an adult apprentice is  defined as being over 20.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Pending the outcome of the draft Budget, it is important to  note that my Department will honour its commitments to those adults already on  the programme. Although there may be no funding available from my Department  for adult apprenticeships, employers can still train adults using the  ApprenticeshipsNI model.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s answer is coming up to two minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Moreover, employers can upskill their staff  through the skills solution service that I have established, which works with  employers to develop a tailored programme of training.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he agree that it is becoming more and  more an issue that apprentices are finding it difficult to complete their  training due to employment circumstances, such as redundancy etc? Will the  Department look at other options or measures to assist apprentices in  completing their training?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. I  accept the point that he made and undertake to look at whatever options we have  to improve the situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  In my constituency, there is a deep worry and concern that the Northern Ireland  apprenticeship programme is under direct threat as a result of the Budget.  Since 2007, 500 adults have gone through the programme to achieve education to  level 2. Lord Empey came forward with a plan to upskill people which is out to  tender at present. I hope that the Minister and the Department will honour the  existing tender because that programme is making a difference, particularly in  an economic climate in which so many adults need to be upskilled to meet the  demands of industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for the interest that  he has shown over a long period on this matter. I largely agree with him about  the importance that has been attached to adult apprenticeships. Certainly, in  an ideal economic world and with a Budget other that the one that I face, I  would not want to impact on adult apprenticeships. However, the harsh realities  are that I must make efficiency savings across my Department. I have attempted  to do so in a careful and responsible manner. I re-emphasise that anyone in an  existing adult apprenticeship will not lose their place; it will continue to be  funded. We are talking about new adult apprenticeship schemes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answers thus far; it is useful to get a bit of background on the impact. The  Minister keeps saying, and I agree with him, that there is a need for DEL to be central to  kick-starting the economy and to be the engine room for that. Taking on board  the Minister&rsquo;s answer to Pat Ramsey on the issue of adult apprenticeships and  reskilling and upskilling in light of some of the job losses, has the Minister  or his officials had any discussions with other Departments, possibly DETI, to  halve the burden of reskilling and upskilling through the adult apprenticeship  scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her question. In  dealing with training and skills, I enjoy a very good relationship with the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and her officials. It is necessary  to keep that training in place not only during the period of economic downturn  but particularly as we prepare for the upturn. I know that there are  significant pressures on the DETI budget too, but where there are ways to co-operate  and collaborate, I am happy to do so and will continue to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his answers thus far. How important is it for  businesses to work with the Department to upskill employees, particularly in  the current economic context?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member makes a particularly important point. I  want to encourage all businesses to, where possible, continue providing  training and upskilling opportunities for their employees, because they will find  that, ultimately, that investment is worth the money. Of course, my Department  remains open to assisting them in every possible way, but we have to realise  the difficult economic circumstances that we find ourselves in and take account  of that. However, my Department is happy, willing and eager to co-operate fully  with businesses at all levels.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Young People Not in Education, Employment  or Training</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning how much funding  he intends to allocate for the implementation of the recommendations in the  report on the inquiry into young people not in education, employment or  training. (AQO 1051/11<a name="AQO1051/11" id="AQO1051/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I should stress at the outset that the funding of  the recommendations of the inquiry into young people not in education,  employment or training (NEETs) is not simply a matter for the Department for  Employment and Learning. Although my Department has a role to play in offering  support to those who have been failed largely by the education system, others,  not least the Department of Education, which has responsibility for early  intervention, have a significant contribution to make.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will no doubt recall, the recently published  report, which I very much welcome, contains 41 recommendations, many of which  are targeted at individual Departments. We are carefully considering those  recommendations in the context of providing a cross-departmental strategic  approach to the issue, and I hope to bring that to the Executive in March to  seek agreement to go to public consultation. Therefore, although at this stage  it is not possible to tell what the funding implications of any specific  changes that flow from the Committee inquiry report might be, it is important  to note that substantial funding is already being allocated to relevant  programmes and services across Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, my Department has in place a wide range of  initiatives, programmes and strategies that are relevant to the issue, such as  the essential skills strategy and Training for Success, which is primarily  aimed at 16- and 17-year-old school leavers. In combination, those two schemes  have already input over &pound;50 million in 2009-2010. My Department bid for  additional resources in the spending review. However, unfortunately, the  outcome of the draft Budget did not provide additional resources for those  purposes. Consequently, on foot of the Committee report and the proposed  strategy, we will also examine the possibility of bidding against the Executive  social investment fund when the criteria become clearer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s two minutes are up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that extensive answer. I am still trying to figure out  whether he will allocate additional funding on foot of the report. Is he  indicating that he intends to make a bid for additional funding either directly  through the Budget or, for example, through the invest to save initiative?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. In  the latter part of my answer, I indicated that there could be an opportunity to  bid for funds from the Executive&rsquo;s social investment fund, which is a new pot  of money. We are still waiting to see the criteria for how we can apply for  that. That would be a sensible way forward for some of the funding initiatives  that we could use.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the very good work of some training skills  programmes and of the end product that they deliver. Will he ensure that he  analyses vigorously the results that many of those projects have delivered when  he looks at the level of funding for the next year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. I am  happy to give that undertaking. When relatively vast sums of money are being  expended, it is important that we analyse the results in detail to ensure that  we are getting value for money. I know of and note the Member&rsquo;s interest in  particular areas and schemes that are working.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s answer. I am sure that he will put me  right if I have picked him up wrongly, but it appears clear to me that he does  not know the terms of reference for the social investment fund. Has he had any  discussions with OFMDFM or had any input into the social investment fund? Given  that there is no Executive fund for children and young people and that,  recently, in the final outworkings of this year&rsquo;s round of funding allocations,  the Finance Minister refused his bid for money to NEETs &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  &mdash; has the Minister any confidence that money will come from elsewhere?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her question. I am  concentrating on the next step, which is the cross-departmental strategy. That  will involve other Departments such as the Department of Education and OFMDFM  as well as my Department, and, with those responsibilities, there will be a  financial consequence. Therefore, we will seek to implement some of the  recommendations contained in the Member&rsquo;s Committee&rsquo;s important and useful  contribution to the debate. I will seek the co-operation of all Departments as  we move forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  The House has discussed the importance of connecting further and higher  education to the business community to ensure that employees are trained in the  necessary skills. One of the key points that was set out in the NEETs inquiry  was the need for improved careers advice. Despite creating a robust model of  careers planning for the schools to use, the uptake seems to vary. How much of  a problem is that in ensuring that young people have sound careers planning?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. As  Minister for Employment and Learning, I remain concerned, to some extent, about  some of the careers advice that is available to young people. In conjunction  with the Department of Education and other agencies, I am seeking to improve careers  advice, particularly when it comes to business and how we can encourage young  people to take up the opportunities that are available to them through  education or through higher and further education. That is an important aspect  of the work that needs to be carried forward. I am not always convinced that  the quality of careers advice is as good as it should be.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Education: Violence Against Staff</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Dr  McDonnell </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what discussions  he, or his Department, has had with the Minister of Education in relation to  violence against education and university workers. &nbsp;(AQO 1052/11<a name="AQO1052/11" id="AQO1052/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Neither my officials nor I have held any  discussions with the Minister of Education or her Department in relation to  violence against education and university workers. If, however, there is a  particular case, I am happy for the Member to write to me.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  We give a lot of attention at times to violence against healthcare workers, but  I am aware of a small trickle of threats of violence against education workers.  Does the Minister feel that it would be appropriate to have a policy or  strategy to deal with it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: It is important that we keep an eye on things as  they happen. I am pleased to say that there does not seem to be a significant  pattern of violent behaviour in higher education. In the past five years,  Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast recorded one incident in which a member of staff was  attacked by a student. That happened in 2007. The University of Ulster  recorded two incidents last year. In one incident, a student attacked a member  of staff, and, in another separate incident, a staff member was attacked by a  friend of a student. There have been no recorded incidents of students  attacking staff at St Mary&rsquo;s University  College or at Stranmillis University   College in that period.  However, if a pattern were to emerge, it would be a matter of concern, and we  would seek to take action.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Minister is right that there is no evidence of attacks against university or  further education college workers, but there has been a problem with violence  and antisocial behaviour in the Holylands around St Patrick&rsquo;s Day. Has the  Minister had discussions with the universities and with Belfast Metropolitan   College on this year&rsquo;s  action plan?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her question and  for her interest, along with that of other Members for that area. The four  local higher education institutions and Belfast Metropolitan   College have been working  closely with partners on the Holylands interagency group on planning and  preparations for the forthcoming St Patrick&rsquo;s Day. Those partners include the  students&rsquo; unions, Belfast City Council, the PSNI and other Departments,  including mine. The preparations will build on the measures already in place,  which helped to ensure a relatively peaceful Hallowe&rsquo;en celebration. Residents&rsquo;  groups have been invited to attend the Holylands interagency group meetings and  have been provided with an update on the latest preparations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister may be aware of a campaign that was launched in this Building,  prior to his appointment as Minister, the aim of which was to stop violence  against women. It related more to higher education and to universities. The  Minister referred to the lack of statistics, but will he join me in encouraging  people, especially women, to report any violence against them to the police to  ensure that there is a true and proper reading of the statistics and to ensure  that things are dealt with accordingly?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary  question. I agree strongly with him and condemn any act of violence against any  individual. I encourage anyone, male or female, who is in the unfortunate  position of having been attacked to report it so that assistance can be given  and so that we can help to eradicate, not simply alleviate, such instances.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Education Maintenance Allowance</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Doherty </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning for an update on the  future of the education maintenance allowance (EMA). (AQO 1053/11<a name="AQO1053/11" id="AQO1053/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I want to say, entirely for the avoidance of  doubt, that I have no plans to abolish the education maintenance allowance in Northern Ireland.  Both my Department and the Department of Education received the findings of the  jointly commissioned review of the education maintenance allowance scheme in Northern Ireland  in December 2010. Officials from both Departments are assessing the findings of  the report; therefore, no decisions have yet been made on the future of the  scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review found that, in the majority of cases, an  allowance makes no difference to young people&rsquo;s decision to remain at school or  college; however, in some cases, it makes a real difference. I am determined  that young people from lower-income families, to whom those allowances make a  real difference, continue to be assisted to stay on at school or college. The  Committee recommended that the allowances could be better targeted. I can  further advise that the report has been shared with the Employment and Learning  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any proposals to change the provision of the EMA scheme in Northern Ireland  will be subject to a public consultation and appropriate equality  considerations. They will also take account of the very difficult budgetary  position that faces my Department.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer; particularly, his assurance that he has no plans to cut the education  maintenance allowance. There is huge public support for retaining it. I am sure  that the Minister is aware that a number of councils have passed motions to  that end, with particular emphasis on lower-income families. Can he  re-emphasise that lower-income families in particular will not be affected by  his future plans?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary  question. Indeed, I am pleased to reaffirm what I have said at the Dispatch  Box: I have no plans to abolish the education maintenance allowance in Northern Ireland.  There had perhaps been an unfortunate campaign or a suggestion that my  Department and I were embarking on that course of action. We have never  indicated that. We have simply agreed with the views that are expressed by  recommendation 41 of the Committee for Employment and Learning&rsquo;s report, which  indicates that EMA could be better targeted, and by better targetting we mean  assisting low-income families in particular. England  has, in effect, abolished EMA payments, and Scotland  and Wales  are reforming theirs. However, I am happy to indicate my position and that of  my Department with regard to Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for his answers. Does he agree with the  Committee for Employment and Learning that the criteria for receiving EMA  should focus more on those for whom it provides a significant incentive to  re-engage?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question.  Indeed, I do agree. There is a significant difference in my saying that I have  no plans to abolish the EMA and agreeing with the Committee&rsquo;s report that  recommended that it should be better targetted. The scheme costs my Department  &pound;26 million a year; it is therefore vital that those resources be properly  targetted at the point of greatest need. I envisage that that work will need to  be done. I am glad that members from all parties played a part in producing the  Committee report and recommendation 41. Most people accept that better  targetting of those needed resources is a good thing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to making EMA a continued success. Will  the Minister assure the House that he will widen the net to ensure that those  from marginalised communities who are currently excluded from EMA will be  included in the future? Will he also give a commitment that the budgetary  restraints that he will have on the new scheme will be minimal and that, going  forward, we will be able to enjoy a level of funding that is the same, if not  better focused, as that to date?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary  question and for the ongoing and never-ending commitments that he urges me to  give. For all that, however, I said what I said. We have no plan to abolish  EMA. Members of all parties in the House, and I hope, the Member, share the  strong belief and agree that the better targeting of this measure could be an  effective assistance to some, particularly lower income families. That is what  we are about, and we will seek to get co-operation as we move forward on that.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Night Classes</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to outline the  potential impact that reductions in his departmental spending might have on  night class provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1054/11<a name="AQO1054/11" id="AQO1054/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I have no proposals to reduce spending on night  class provision. In the overall strategic framework, colleges and universities  are best placed to make decisions on the type and timing of their provision as  they seek to meet the needs of their local communities and local businesses. In  making those decisions, they will be very much aware that night class provision  represents a flexible, responsive way of delivering the training and  educational needs of people who work. However, Members will also be aware that,  in any spending plans, after delivering savings of 5% year on year, I will  still have the problem of a deficit of &pound;40 million in 2011-12 and &pound;31 million  in the following year. If that is not resolved through additional funding,  colleges and universities will have to look at further options to reduce  expenditure. Those could impact on day and night provision.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  What assessment has the Minister made of the efficiency and effectiveness of  the current night class provision across the Province? Does he see scope for  improvement in the way in which it is delivered?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his supplementary  question. I agree with the thrust of what he said. There are always ways in  which we can, perhaps, be more inventive and use money more wisely. I am  generally satisfied with the provision that my further education division  provides. The budget for further education is in the region of &pound;150 million a  year. Included in that amount is a spend on what are called hobby and leisure  courses. All those decisions are taken, quite rightly, by the colleges, which  can identify the programmes and courses that best suit the needs of their local  communities. I am very satisfied that those courses are in place, as are the  opportunities for the people who live in the areas that the colleges serve. I hope  that we can continue to fund those courses at that significant level of public  expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I am glad to hear that the Minister agrees with the night class provision. Have  there been discussions with any of the FE colleges? Does the Minister intend to  utilise the FE colleges for night classes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her question.  Perhaps the Member is confusing night classes with hobby and leisure  opportunities or, more generally, night classes that involve courses for  everyone, young and old included. I am reasonably satisfied that the FE  colleges have that fairly well under control. I am always happy to take advice  on any area where the Member feels we are failing. If she wants to highlight a  particular circumstance, I will happily take it on board.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="a4" id="a4"></a>Regional Development</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 2 has been withdrawn, and a written answer has been  requested.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">A5 and A8 Road Projects</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Beggs </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of the  impact on the A5 and the A8 road schemes if the next Government of the Republic of Ireland renege on their &pound;400 million  contribution. (AQO 1064/11<a name="AQO1064/11" id="AQO1064/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">12. <strong>Mrs  McGill </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the A5  road scheme and the Irish Government&rsquo;s commitment to this scheme. (AQO 1075/11<a name="AQO1075/11" id="AQO1075/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: With your permission, a LeasCheann  Comhairle, I will answer questions 1 and 12 together, as they relate to  progress on the A5 scheme and the impact on the A5 and the A8 schemes if the  Southern Government renege on their &pound;400 million contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Projects to provide dual carriageways on the A5 between  Derry and Aughnacloy and on the A8 between Belfast and Larne are being taken forward as  a result of an agreement in 2007 between the Dublin Government and the  Executive. Reflecting that agreement, the draft Budget provides my Department  with sufficient funds to continue the development of both schemes and to carry  out substantial construction works within the Budget period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At a plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council  on 21 January this year, the Dublin Government reaffirmed their commitment to  make a contribution of &pound;400 million to the A5 and A8 dualling projects. If a  future Government were to reconsider their commitment, my Executive colleague  the Minister of Finance would have to assess the implications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The A5 western transport corridor scheme is progressing  well and the third key milestone for the scheme was achieved on target, with  the publication of the draft statutory Orders and the environmental statement  in November 2010. That was followed by the formal public consultation period,  which ended on 21 January 2011. Given the interest in the project and the level  of objection raised, I have decided that a public inquiry will be held to  consider the objections.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: We  have learnt this morning of the huge cost to the Minister&rsquo;s Department of  property getting blighted, yet he is not considering going ahead with building  on those sites. I am referring to the A2. Apparently over &pound;12 million has been  spent on property, yet that scheme is on hold. Does the Minister accept that  the A5 has not been prioritised by engineers or the road haulage industry as a  problem area and that, in continuing with that scheme, which requires 60% of  his entire capital budget over the next four years, many other, more advanced  schemes in other areas will be blighted &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  should really be rethought to ensure that other priority schemes that are more  important to the economy, such as the A8 and the A2, can proceed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I can assure the Member that there is significant  support for the A5 scheme to go ahead. I am sure that he, as an East Antrim representative, realises that the funding  arrangements for the two schemes have been linked together. I am sure that he  would not want to see the scheme for the A8, which connects Larne to Belfast, jeopardised  either. Both schemes, the contributions to them, the cost of them and the need  for them have been a matter of agreement by the Executive as a whole and the  Dublin Government. There has been recurring agreement over the past number of  years at each North/South plenary meeting when the matter has been raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Support for the A5 scheme is substantial, and I invite the  Member to engage with chambers of commerce and businesspeople in the  north-west, and with people in Derry, Donegal  and Tyrone who feel isolated from the rest of the island because of their  infrastructure connection. He will see a very strong desire for the Derry to Aughnacloy scheme to go ahead. As I said, no  later than last month, the contribution from the Dublin Government was  reaffirmed at the North/South plenary meeting, and the commitment to go ahead  with both schemes was reaffirmed by the Executive and the Dublin Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  response. I represent West Tyrone, and the A5, if it goes ahead &mdash; as we hope it  will &mdash; will go through a large part of my constituency. Can the Minister give  an assurance to people in my area who are very much in favour of the A5 but who  might have some concerns about exactly where the route will go? Will he give  those people some assurances about what might come out of the public inquiry?  Exactly what stage is all of that at?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: One question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In my previous response, I expressed what I have  found to be very strong support by both Administrations, North and South, and  by many people whom I have spoken to in the business community, political  representatives, and others in the north-west region generally. Given that it  is the biggest road-building project of its kind on the island of Ireland,  there will undoubtedly be concerns among those whose land it goes over about  access, compensation arrangements and loss of land. There is a need, as I  established and recently announced, for a public inquiry into all that to  afford people with concerns about the project, and those who support it, an  opportunity to express those views in a public forum and be heard by an  inspector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The inquiry will commence in May 2011 and run for  approximately eight weeks. Given the size of the scheme, it is likely that the  public inquiry will be held at several locations along the proposed route. The  details of that will be published in good time for people to be able to access  the inquiry, and those who support and those who object to the scheme will have  ample opportunity to make their cases before an inspector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Given the ending of end-year flexibility (EYF), what risks are associated with  a probable or possible delay in the public inquiry report and its outworkings  on the Department&rsquo;s roads budget, given that 70% of the budget is ring-fenced  for the A5 and the A8?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There is always a risk with huge capital projects,  which has to be managed and assessed as we go along. The spend for each project  is predicted year on year as the projects are expected to happen. However, over  the past number of years, significant road projects were on time and on budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The arrangement that delivered the Newry to Dundalk road between the North and the South is similar  to that being put into place for the A5. All the milestones have thus far been  met on time, which augurs well for the proper outworking of the project in relation  to the capital spend set against it. There is always a risk with major capital  projects. Nonetheless, there were significant engineering issues with the A4,  yet that project was delivered on time and on budget. I am optimistic that the  A5 and the A8 will be delivered in a similar fashion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  We hope that the A5 and A8 schemes will go ahead. However, surely a public  inquiry into the A5 will free up funds. Will the Minister not reconsider his  decision to put back the improvement of the A2, bearing in mind that I was  reliably informed that the A2 was included in his Department&rsquo;s original budget  proposals?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The public inquiry into the A5 was always likely to  happen. I do not understand why the Member said that that will now free up  funds because it was always built into the likely progression of the A5.  Significant road-building or capital schemes almost always involve a public  inquiry. Given that the A5 will be the biggest such scheme undertaken here, the  likelihood was that it would have a public inquiry. That does not alter any  money that was made available for the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s disappointment about the A2  scheme. My Department faces severe budgetary restrictions. It is the big  capital-spending Department and its budget was the most severely hit by the  Tory-led Government proposals from Westminster  with a 40% cut in capital, so we have to make judgements and take hard  decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the A2 is a good scheme that is recognised as  such, there are other significant areas of spend across the Department on  public transport, saving jobs in Translink and structural maintenance across  the North. I proposed that there was no room in our budget for that scheme to  go ahead. That proposition is out for consultation, and the Member and others  will have an opportunity to make their views known, and the Assembly will then  have an opportunity to vote.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are so many other pressing demands right across the  North &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  We have been waiting for 30 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. All remarks must be made through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Many places across the North have been waiting a long  time for infrastructure spend. The Executive, in their Programme for Government,  recognised that there was an infrastructure imbalance in the North between east  and west, and they set about doing something about that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Budget 2011-15: Belfast Harbour</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline any ongoing  work currently taking place to achieve the anticipated dividends from Belfast  Harbour Commission as set out in the draft Budget. (AQO 1066/11<a name="AQO1066/11" id="AQO1066/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Department&rsquo;s draft 2011-15 spending and savings  proposals, which were published on 13 January 2011, included projections for  the release of value from the Belfast Harbour Commissioners, in line with the  Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget 2010. The draft Budget envisages that additional current  expenditure of &pound;15 million per annum can be realised in each of the years 3 and  4, but I believe that it could be possible to achieve a funding stream of up to  &pound;125 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Officials from my Department and the Belfast Harbour  Commissioners are scoping out potential options, excluding privatisation, for  realising the fund outlined in the draft Budget. Officials are due to prepare a  report for the ministerial Budget review group by the end of February 2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. Considering that we are looking at a &pound;4 billion cut in the block grant  by the Tory/UUP brotherhood, it is important that we look at ways to get  additional money. Will legislation be required to take that forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member is correct that, with the substantial cut  in our Budget by Westminster,  it was the duty of the Executive and the Departments to look at areas in which  additional revenue could be raised and to be as inventive and as flexible as  possible. Obviously, given that Belfast  harbour and the port are publicly owned, the Executive will, quite rightly,  have a look at them as part of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even though significant benefits could be accrued from the  propositions that have been put forward, it is right that we have an  opportunity to test them. That is why, whatever benefits are anticipated,  prudent as they are, have not been factored into the Budget assessment until  years three and four. There is a possibility &mdash; perhaps a probability &mdash; that  that would require new primary legislation, and, as I said, the Belfast Harbour  Commissioners and departmental officials are considering potential options,  excluding privatisation, that could enable the Belfast Harbour Commissioners to  release resources to assist the Executive. The consideration of potential  legislative implications, including the need to promote new legislation, will  be considered as part of that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that, given the cuts that the UUP/Conservatives and  Alliance/Liberal Democrats are imposing on the people of Northern Ireland,  it is incumbent on every Department to look at where they can make the  dividends to offset the impact on the most vulnerable people? Is it not  important that we offset the effects on vulnerable people and do something, as  opposed to just talking about that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I find myself in agreement with the Member. There are  a number of options. I listened to the debates on the finance motions yesterday  and the Budget debate this morning. I find some of the propositions and  suggestions that are being put forward amusing, particularly those that are put  forward by people who last year sat smiling like Cheshire cats behind David  Cameron as he brought his cuts agenda to the North and advocated that people  here supported him. Those same people now lament most the impact of those cuts  on the Departments that their party colleagues are in charge of.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of options that we can consider. The  first one, which some people have advocated, is to just get on with the Tory  cuts, accept what has been imposed on us from Westminster and get on with the pain of that.  There are parties in the Chamber that advocated doing that. The second option  is to fold up our tents, walk away and say that we are not prepared to deliver  the cuts, which means that we are back to direct rule. The third option is to  put our heads together to examine revenue-raising options for the Executive and  ways in which we can mitigate the worst impacts of the cuts that have been  proposed by the Conservative/Lib Dem coalition in Britain. The third option is the  best option.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member that all Ministers should be  putting their heads together in that regard and putting serious effort into  finding efficiencies and savings in their Departments and into exploring  options for revenue-raising, which can help us to continue to spend in areas  that the Executive have decided are a priority for us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does the Minister envisage legislation in this Assembly or, as the chairperson  of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners said, at Westminster? Given that that money has been  earmarked in the Budget, what contingency plans has he in mind if there are  difficulties with that legislative route?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Whether and where legislation is required is a matter  of ongoing discussion between departmental officials, including the head of the  Civil Service, and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. Some legal views have  been expressed on the issue, and I have heard differing legal opinions. I am  quite prepared to explore that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the revenue that may be raised is quite prudent,  with &pound;15 million being put into the Department&rsquo;s baseline in years three and  four of the Budget period. I do not envisage any difficulties. Indeed, the  Minister of Finance, the First Minister, the deputy First Minister and I met  the Belfast Harbour Commissioners last week, and we agreed that anything was  possible with legislation. There was a genuine commitment, on their behalf and  ours, to explore, in a positive way, any opportunities that might arise as a  result of looking at the areas around the port. The commitment is there, and it  is likely that we can achieve this. It is a prudent commitment, and I think  that it can be increased. When the Budget was presented, we said that we had  already established some &pound;800 million of revenue, with the potential for a  further &pound;800 million, and there is more potential in that proposition.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Spatial Planning: Cross-border Framework</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline the progress  on the all-Ireland collaborative planning spatial framework. (AQO 1067/11<a name="AQO1067/11" id="AQO1067/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Yesterday, I announced the commencement of a joint  public consultation on a framework for a collaboration document entitled  &lsquo;Spatial Strategies on the Island   of Ireland.&rsquo; The  consultation will last for eight weeks and will end on Monday 11 April. The  consultation document was prepared jointly with the Department of the  Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the South.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Will the Minister outline what benefits the framework will provide for  cross-border collaboration?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Regardless of people&rsquo;s constitutional political  viewpoint, there is a broad recognition that we live on a small island of five  or six million people, which is becoming more and more interdependent in  economic growth. Certainly, the North/South Ministerial Council and the  implementation bodies have been working diligently to promote areas of mutual  co-operation and advantage. There is an opportunity to boost economic  performance and competitiveness across the island through cross-border  co-operation and collaboration. It is recognised, whatever people&rsquo;s political  viewpoint, that more can be achieved through collaboration than competition  between North and South.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Co-operation or collaboration between regions for territorial  development is accepted as good practice in the European Union, and it is  promoted in the European spatial development perspective and the EU territorial  agenda. The consultation document that is out at the moment, allied to the  regional development strategy, will provide useful guidance to policymakers for  some of the work of the Departments in coming years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I listened with care to the Minister, who is also a MLA for Newry and Armagh. Has the Minister factored into his considerations  the impact on the ports of Larne, Belfast,  Londonderry, Coleraine and Warrenpoint of the development of a port at Braemor,  which is south of Drogheda? Has he also  factored in the impact on the transport and distribution industries if its  associated all-Ireland distribution hub goes ahead?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It is an interesting point. There has been much  conversation. I have attended many ports conferences and had conversations with  port users and operators in the North and across the island. There is much less  conversation about the development of Braemor recently than there was a number  of years back when the Progressive Democrats had more influence in the Dublin  Government. I imagine that following the election, there will be even less discussion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It also opens up interesting opportunities, because there  is a capacity issue at Dublin port, and ports on the eastern seaboard such as  Larne, Belfast and Warrenpoint are looking at the opportunities that that will  afford. Things like this spatial strategy and the all-Ireland discussion on  economic development and growth have huge benefits, and the ports are part of  that. If a significant development were to happen in the South, it would have  an impact on some of the ports here, but, equally, there are opportunities for  collaboration and competition between ports.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I welcome the publication of the consultation. I am sure that the Minister will  agree with me that greenhouse gas emissions from our region are running at  unacceptably high levels. In fact, they are nearly 10 times higher in this  region than in the other parts of these islands. What steps is the Minister  taking through the strategy to address the carbon footprint of this island as a  whole?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The collaborative framework is a high-level document  that does not go down into the details of transport arrangements. I hope that  the Member will take the opportunity to study the document to see where it  dovetails neatly with the regional development strategy. Nonetheless, his point  about the unacceptability of carbon emissions, particularly from transport, is  one that we take seriously. That is why such an emphasis has been put on  sustainable transport arrangements, particularly between North and South, and  it has been a subject of discussion at every one of our meetings. However, that  is between the Department of Transport in the South and my Department here. The  spatial strategy framework concerns the Department of the Environment, Heritage  and Local Government in the South, and it is not, therefore, part of the  North/South transport sectoral meetings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, there is an opportunity for joined-up  arrangements, not just across Departments here but North/South, to try to  reduce the carbon footprint, particularly in transport, and to use  collaborative strategies right across the island to achieve that.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Belfast  Rapid Transit System</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Sheehan </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what commitments his  Department intends to make in the draft budget in relation to the Belfast rapid transit  scheme. (AQO 1068/11<a name="AQO1068/11" id="AQO1068/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Department&rsquo;s draft budget provides for the  continuation of the planning phase and the commencement of the implementation  of rapid transit for Belfast.  It also provides for the implementation of the sustainable transport-enabling  measures phase of the Belfast on the Move  transport master plan in Belfast  city centre. The project is focused on the redistribution of existing road  space to provide the extensive bus priority measures for use by all public  transport vehicles, including the proposed rapid transit system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Sheehan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What is the Minister&rsquo;s position on  the public finance commitment to the project?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Department is in the process of securing external  support to complete the outline business case for the pilot rapid transport  project, which will identify the preferred options for Belfast rapid transport network routes, the  procurement strategy, the commercial business model and a system of fares. The  identification of the preferred options will also allow the Department to  undertake the necessary public consultation, impact assessments and appraisals.  A public awareness exercise, which is anticipated to take place in 2011 as part  of the outline business case, will give everyone an opportunity to comment on  the options for Belfast  rapid transit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the capital budget in the Department is  particularly challenging, this project is identified in the Programme for  Government as a key project for Belfast,  and we want to keep it live and on the books. Although I would prefer that we  were much further ahead with the capital commitment to rapid transit, we will  continue with the preparatory work. Some of that work will also enhance and  improve quality bus corridors, which will improve the overall public transport  network in Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Given today&rsquo;s announcement of the failure to upgrade the road network from Belfast to east Antrim, will the Minister consider the  movement of people between east Antrim and Belfast city centre? Will he continue to  exclude north Belfast from the Belfast regional transportation scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: East Antrim is  served by a rail link and a road network into the city. As I said in my answer  to Mr Neeson, I understand the frustration caused by the delay of the A2  project. Nonetheless, it is well served in its connectivity to Belfast city.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to the question on north Belfast,  the initial pilot project identified only two routes before I came into office,  and both of them were in east Belfast.  We wanted to try to create connectivity right across the city so that it was  not simply about bringing people into the city centre but connecting people  from either side of it, and we have included a route to the west of the city.  The Belfast  rapid transit project is a pilot scheme, and pilot schemes were identified, but  the intention is to connect the rest of the city. I had discussions with  representatives from North Belfast, including the MP for the area and the  previous Minister for Social Development, and they identified areas in north Belfast where a rapid  transit system would serve a useful purpose. It is my strong desire, and a  necessity for the city of Belfast, that we  continue with the project to establish the initial routes and to link other  parts of the city, including north Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. I obviously support the general direction  in which the Minister is going. He is full of laudable aspirations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister tell us how many miles of quality bus  corridors have been established in Belfast  in the current financial year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not have the exact number of miles to hand, so I  will write to the Member with the details. However, quality bus corridors are a  priority for the Department. We have recently established one on the Ormeau Road. As I  said in my initial answer, the Belfast  on the Move project is about street space in the city centre and lane  availability. We intend to move ahead with the project in this Budget period,  and we have budgeted for that. The project will allow redistribution of  existing roads space to provide extensive bus priority schemes in the city  centre, and that in turn will lend itself to the development of the  rapid-transit project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will endeavour to get the Member the information on the  exact number of miles of quality bus corridors. This is the way forward for the  city. All urban areas experience congestion, and the way to deal with it is to  make it less attractive for car users to bring their vehicles into the city  centre and more attractive for people to use public transport.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">NI Water</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development when the new permanent board of  NI Water will be appointed. (AQO 1069/11<a name="AQO1069/11" id="AQO1069/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The process leading to the appointment of a  chairperson and up to four new non-executive directors to the board of NI Water  is under way. The closing date for the chairperson competition was 14 January  2011. For the non-executive directors competition, it was 28 January.  Shortlisting for the position of chairperson took place last week, and interviews  will take place in early March. The intention is to appoint a chairperson in  the first instance so that that individual can participate as a panel member in  appointing the other non-executive directors. The timetable envisaged is that,  subject to the various stages of the process remaining on track, the  chairperson should be in place before the end of March, with the remainder of  the board appointed by the end of June.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer and welcome the fact that progress is being  made. The Minister will be aware that, this past number of days, we have been  discussing budgetary matters. There has been a growing clamour from some in the  Chamber for a privatisation agenda. What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on  privatisation of the water service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It is not simply my views that matter, although they  are forthrightly and consistently expressed. The Executive as a whole have set  their face against privatisation. There is no doubt that the agenda for NI  Water under direct rule was to take it from being a Government service and  structure and make it a Government-owned company. It was eventually intended  for it to be privatised, with separate water charges for consumers, including  domestic consumers. As I said, the Executive have set their face against that.  I have been at the forefront of proposing that course of action from the  Executive, and I intend to bring a paper to the Executive before the end of  this term to inform an incoming Executive. It has been my firm view for some  time that not only is it a matter of dealing with the funding issue for NIW but  the structure under which it was set up is not fit for purpose for a devolved  Government. If the Executive want more authority and responsibility over the  agencies in our Departments, we need to have different arrangements for  managing them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the annoyance, anger and frustration that many  people felt over the series of debacles that have surrounded Northern Ireland  Water during his more recent tenure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the exercise that he is embarking on, what guarantee  will the Minister give the people of Northern Ireland that we will not  have a repeat or a mark II?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I presume that the issues that the Member refers to  primarily are the freeze/thaw issues over Christmas and the loss of water as a  consequence of them. He will know that the Executive have launched an  investigation, involving the Utility Regulator and independent members. That  investigation is due to report to the Executive by the end of the month.  Whatever recommendations are in that report will be considered by me and the  Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">NIW has already put forward a short-term  resilience-improvement plan to ensure that we get through the rest of the  winter without a repeat of the types of incidents that we saw over Christmas.<span style="font-family:'ITC Franklin Gothic Demi'; "> </span></p>

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a5" id="a5"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Budget Bill [NIA11/10] be  agreed. &mdash; [The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will pick up from where we were before lunch and Question Time. I covered a  substantial amount of what I wanted to cover in my earlier contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to the Department for Regional Development  (DRD) and the draft Budget. The way that DRD has been treated is a particularly  good example of the impact that the draft Budget is having on ordinary working  people, on rural communities and on the most marginalised in our towns and  rural areas. It is worth noting that it was the Minister for Regional  Development, in the detail that he provided to the Committee for Regional  Development, who conceded that, for example, the cut to the rural transport  fund would disproportionately affect socially excluded nationalist people. It  is his own admission that the draft Budget will hit working-class nationalists  in rural communities hardest, and yet we are still proceeding with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It does not stop there. In looking at the impact that the  cutbacks in public transport in urban areas will have, we see that the Minister  for Regional Development concedes in written documentation provided to the  Committee that those cutbacks will hit working-class unionist communities  hardest. That is just a small example of the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget and how  it affects and undermines the future of the most marginalised in our  communities most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Committee for Regional Development&rsquo;s response to the  draft Budget, we were fortunate enough to be able to reflect the views of some  of the organisations that are, so to speak, at the coalface and deal daily with  the needs of those who most rely on public transport. The Inclusive Mobility  and Transport Advisory Committee (IMTAC) speaks out for people who are  mobility-impaired. It points out that restrictions in the door-to-door services  will limit the ability of older people and people with disabilities to go out  in the evenings and at weekends.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cumulative impact of the reduction in the number of  rural community transport partnerships and the reduction in the subsidy to  Translink will be to reduce the supports available to the most vulnerable in  our community. That is not just my view but that of IMTAC and the Committee for  Regional Development, whose report says that those reductions:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;will cause social exclusion, isolate many people in  their homes and reverse the dramatic progress Northern Ireland has made in the  past 15 to 20 years for disabled people, young people, older people and those  who have no access to a car.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In other words, we are being told that the draft  Budget sets us back a decade and more. It undoes all the good work, all the  investment and all the progress of the past decade in providing accessible  transport to the most marginalised in the community. Is that what the House  wants to vote for and be part of?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Member has illuminated considerably the different parts of the draft  Budget. He has outlined, on numerous occasions, his complaint against and his  opposition to the draft Budget as constituted, and now he has moved to the  issue of rural transport. However, the issue remains: from where does he  suggest we take the money in order to put it into DRD as he has just outlined?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Mr Campbell&rsquo;s question is a very good one. I do not wish to go back over the  past hour and a half, nor does the Minister of Finance and Personnel, who, I am  sure, has made copious notes. For Mr Campbell&rsquo;s information and for colleagues  who were not present during my first-half contribution, I spelt out, at  considerable length, the areas in which the SDLP believes that Mr Campbell&rsquo;s  questions could be properly answered. It is our firm conviction that there is  an opportunity to raise more revenue in a way that will not impact on the most  marginalised in our community. We, as an Executive and an Assembly, should  dedicate our time, best energies and all our considerable talents to exploring  every one of those options, adopt those that would genuinely work and dismiss  those that would not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the question of rural transport. The Community  Transport Association is also of the view that the reduction in the rural  transport fund and transport programmes for people with disabilities will have  a significant impact on rural communities in the next four years. It identified  the potential for increased rural isolation and exclusion from government  services and commerce of the most vulnerable in our society. It says that  reductions in the rural community transport network would mean that 25% to 30%  of people in rural areas would not be able to access public transport solutions  in the next four years. If that is devolution at work, I am sorry but I do not  recognise it. The people on the ground and the people who put us here &mdash; no  matter who we are or what party we stand under &mdash; will not recognise it either.  The impact on older people, people with disabilities, people with mobility  difficulties and their families, arising from proposed reductions in  door-to-door services, rural transport, community transport and shop mobility  schemes, will be felt in every town and townland in this region. It will be  felt hardest and most severely by those who have least and need most. That is  not what we should sign off as a Budget. It is a crying shame, and, in the time  available, we must seek ways of addressing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before concluding, I will return to one other issue that we  debated earlier. I regret, as I regretted earlier, that the Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel is not in the Chamber. I do not think that  it is appropriate or fair to the rest of us that the principled scrutineer &mdash; he  is joining us now, which is perfect timing. I will give the Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel an opportunity to take his seat, because I  would welcome an intervention from him on this point. Earlier, we discussed the  need for more transparency in the budgetary process. There seemed to be a  feeling on some sides of the House that that was not needed. However, the  Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s draft report on the Executive draft  Budget 2011-15 includes the following paragraph:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In view of the limitations to the in-year monitoring  process, the Committee reiterates its call for the establishment of a regularised  annual budgetary review mechanism set to a pre-determined timetable, which it  considers will add transparency and better enable the Executive to adapt its  plans to the clear and changing environments and unforeseen circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have a basic question for colleagues in the  House. Is the Committee telling us what the SDLP is saying: we need a better  and more structured budgetary scrutiny process? Can the Committee Chairperson  confirm to the House that that is so, or is what I am reading not the Chairperson&rsquo;s  opinion but that of the Committee?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McKay)</strong>: I am trying to fill  myself in on what the Member has been saying in my absence. The Committee  report on the Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget has not been finalised. It is  pre-emptive for any Member to quote from draft reports.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am happy to have given way to Mr McKay. He is, of course, a member of the  Committee, and I presume that he has a mind of his own. I understand that my  colleagues on the Committee are happy with that paragraph. I do not believe  that there has been huge dissent. I am happy for any other Committee members to  inform the House of their position. It seems to me to be a perfectly good  paragraph. I do not see what the problem is in putting it on the record of the  House that that is the sort of road that we should go down. If a Statutory  Committee is thinking about this on a preliminary basis, then &ldquo;Great&rdquo;. What I  do not understand and what those outside the House who are watching will not  understand is why people seem to have a problem about agreeing with a good  idea. It seems to me that this is more about what we suspected it was about,  which is carve-up politics rather than consensual solutions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am speaking as Chairperson of  the Committee. The Committee is in the middle of considering its draft report,  which is open to further discussion. The draft report has not been agreed by  the Committee, and I ask the Member not to quote paragraphs from it for  discussion in the debate today, until the Committee has had time to carry out  the proper process and come to a final agreement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate Mr McKay&rsquo;s clarification that he is the Chairperson of the Committee  for Finance and Personnel; I think we knew that. He is also, of course, an MLA  and is perfectly entitled to his opinion as such. We will leave it at that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a fundamentally flawed draft Budget. That is not  just my opinion; it is the opinion of Patricia McKeown also. The regional  secretary of UNISON described analysing the proposals before us as a &ldquo;tortuous  exercise&rdquo;. She said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about something that is highly  susceptible to legal challenge. We&rsquo;re talking about something that has not been  developed in any kind of collective cross governmental way.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">So, no excuses for that. We are saying to politicians  that you&rsquo;ve got to re-think this one.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">To be honest, I do not always agree with Patricia  McKeown. However, I do on this occasion. I also agree with NIPSA, the  Construction Industry Federation and NICVA.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Will you illuminate what you disagree with her about?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  We will leave that for another day, Mr McCartney. We are debating the draft  Budget, and, if I were to stray from that, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would pull me  back and ask me what I was doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem that colleagues might have is that we are  focusing on the draft Budget. Many of them would be much happier if we were  having a debate about another issue during the time when we are focusing on the  draft Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.] </span>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd was not around earlier, but he may have had the TV on in his room, if he  was there. I want to return to something that seems to have entered the O&rsquo;Dowd  vernacular. We know what that is like; it becomes a sort of self-perpetuating  misleading statement. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd suggested in the House yesterday that the SDLP  was pursuing a privatisation agenda with Northern Ireland Water. I addressed  that matter with the Minister earlier, and I am happy to repeat it for the  record and for Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s ears. Mutualisation of Northern Ireland Water is the  opposite of privatisation. If Mr O&rsquo;Dowd knew anything about mutualisation, he  would know that mutual companies are owned by their customers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  No, I will finish this point, and then I will give way, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A mutual company, in the context of Northern Ireland Water,  would be one owned by the people of Northern Ireland, because they are  the customers of Northern Ireland Water. In fact, the mutualisation of Northern  Ireland Water would guarantee that it remains in public control and in public  ownership.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will give way at the end, Mr McCartney.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also not true &mdash; we dealt with this matter earlier too  &mdash; that, if you mutualise Northern Ireland Water, you must also introduce water  charges. That is not so, and it shows that people have not done their research.  What you must do, if you mutualise a company and want it to raise money  independently &mdash; something that we all want to see happening, so that we can  make the investment that, we believe, needs to be made in water and sewerage  infrastructure &mdash; is demonstrate a guaranteed source of revenue. We could do  that through a permanent subsidy. It would mean, as the Minister and I debated,  going back to the Treasury and negotiating as we did for the RRI and for the  Presbyterian Mutual Society and on many other occasions. However, there is no  reason why we could not mutualise this company and why we could not guarantee  an income stream that would satisfy bond markets and other investors who would  be able to put their money into our sewerage systems and water mains without  having to introduce water charges here. I will have that debate anywhere and  with any Member of the House, because it is an important one.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  My reference to the SDLP&rsquo;s privatisation agenda was broader than a reference to  just the issue of water. Selling off publicly owned DRD car parks to the  private sector is, in anybody&rsquo;s words, privatisation, so perhaps the great,  wonderful, wise one will explain that one to me. A main plank of the SDLP&rsquo;s  economic policy is to sell off publicly owned car parks to the private sector,  which is privatisation. The wise one can knock me down on that one if he  wishes; I await that. I am concerned that the SDLP is going down the road of  privatising NI Water. That is where the SDLP wants to see it sitting in five  years&rsquo; or 10 years&rsquo; time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s contribution. I do not see any policy justification  for DRD&rsquo;s car parks remaining on the public balance sheet, and I make no  apology for that. I am not allergic to that idea, but, if Mr O&rsquo;Dowd is, he can  consult &lsquo;Das Kapital&rsquo;. I find it an interesting reference point, but it is not  my guiding light when I get up in the morning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the broader issue &mdash; this is an important point to make &mdash;  water will need an awful lot of investment in the next 20 years. We all know  that, and we cannot duck it. We cannot just keep passing on that problem to  subsequent Executives. We are going to find ourselves in deep, deep doo-doo &mdash;  pardon the pun &mdash; if we do not tackle the investment needs of our water and  sewerage services. As Mr O&rsquo;Dowd seems to be suggesting and as the Minister  seems to be advocating, we could ask the Executive to bear the burden of that  investment and to absorb Northern Ireland Water back into the Executive and  then ask whoever the Minister of Finance and Personnel is &mdash; in that case, it  would be an even worse job than it would be today &mdash; to figure out how to meet  our capital investment requirements through traditional public finance. If we  did that, two things would happen. The first is that we would quickly find the  vast majority of our capital budget going into our sewerage and water systems,  and there would be very little left for anything else. The second thing is that  it would actually end up costing us more.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we were to bring Northern Ireland Water back on the  balance sheet today, we would immediately subject the Executive, the Department  of Finance and Personnel and the Northern Ireland block to capital  charges and VAT receipts. So, the solution to the water problem is not  privatisation &mdash; I think that we all agree on that and on the fact that we want  a water company that is owned by the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; and it is not  to reintegrate NIW as an agency, because that model simply would not be able to  meet the financial investment requirements of the next 20 years. It would put a  burden on public funding and finances that we would not be able to meet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to have a mature and informed debate about this. I  am up for that, and I know that many colleagues will be, too. There will be  points at which the Minister of Finance and Personnel will rightly raise  concerns and say, &ldquo;Well, what you are suggesting will require some changes to  Treasury rules or to this or that&rdquo;, and it may do. However, let us unite around  something that can actually deliver what we all know is needed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  The Member says that because the water service needs a lot of investment, we  should go down the road of what he is suggesting. Is he, therefore, saying that  because Roads Service will need a lot of investment, we should introduce toll  bridges and toll roads? Is he also saying that a toll should be charged at the  doors of hospitals because they need a lot of investment? Is he saying that he wants  to go back to the Durkan tax that was proposed at the time of the RRI?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. The answer to those questions is, of  course, no, no and no, and there was no such thing as a Durkan tax. However, Mr  Molloy makes an important point: there is a key difference between water and  the other major infrastructure projects. The need for investment in water is  bigger and more immediate than in nearly every other infrastructure. That is  our problem. The Minister comes to the House nearly every week, and he is  correct to remind us that the system is in a deeply fragile state because of underinvestment  in water and sewerage services. It will get better only if we make rapid and  significant investment. It is in a more precarious state than our road network.  It just is. That is not our fault; we inherited it. Therefore, the solution  that we will have to develop should be capable of injecting serious amounts of  capital money in a relatively short time. We could do that through public  finances. However, if we did, there would be no new schools and no new  hospitals, there would be very few kilometres of new road, and things would not  be getting better. That is why I say to colleagues that it is time to have a  mature debate about this. It is also why I say that it is possible to invest  without having to automatically assume that that means water charging. Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd was right to raise that point, although I perhaps disagree with the tone  in which he did so. It is possible to invest. However, we need to think outside  the box. I do not want to drag on too much, but I would appreciate the  opportunity to return to that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP believes that, if this Budget were passed, we  would have no plan for rebalancing the economy of our region. We could be  looking at up to 9,000 public service job losses, and we would face a pay  freeze for the 7,400 civil servants who earn below the average industrial wage  that Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs take. The SDLP also believes that thousands more people  would face benefit cuts by 2012 and that there would be the potential for  hospital closures. We know that. At the same time, the prospect of new  medicines and new medical facilities, such as the cancer centre in Altnagelvin,  would not be available for patients, and there would be no robust strategy for  job creation. There would also be less independent scrutiny of government,  because of what this Budget would do to the Assembly, the Audit Office and the  other key scrutiny bodies. There would be a massive drop in building,  particularly social housing building, with consequential job losses. Over 100  schools would go without the repairs that they so desperately need, and there  would be the potential to introduce student fees of &pound;5,750. Such student fees  would say to working families that they could not afford to send their children  to be educated, they could not afford what a previous generation was able to  afford, and they could not afford to become fully signed-up members of society,  because we are going to stop them doing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For all those reasons, I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to adopt the  long-standing SDLP motto that there is a better way. If the DUP is serious  about living up to its motto of keeping Northern Ireland moving forward, I  ask it to seriously revisit this Budget and to return to the House before the  end of the process with something that is built on the twin pillars of social  justice and economic development. What they bring should mean that we can all  face the people, proud of what this place can deliver and of what devolution  can mean. It should also mean that we can look the most marginalised in our  society in the eye and say that, above all, this Assembly stands up for them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  have to confess, I feel somewhat like a batsman who has been padded up in the  pavilion for the past four hours behind the slow-scoring, plodding opening  batsman who is taking his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  He did not make too many sixes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Certainly not, never mind any fours. I am conscious of the need to pick up the  run rate, and I have no intention of going for that length of time. I will be  an Adam Gilchrist and have a quick cameo, rather than a Jacques Kallis,  plodding away all day for 50.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In all the time that Conall McDevitt was speaking, we did  not get an answer to whether it is the SDLP&rsquo;s view that this Budget is a  DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in carve-up or a document that has the SDLP&rsquo;s fingerprints all over  it, thanks to its wonderful policy document that was published at 11.58 pm on  the day before the Executive agreed its draft Budget. Perhaps one day we will  find that out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Picking up on what Conall said at the end of his  contribution, I fear that he was getting more and more tied up in knots on the  issue of mutualisation. I have no difficulty in talking about the concept of  market testing government services. It is important that we do not approach  this from an ideological perspective. We have to do what is in the best  interests of public finances and public service customers. I happen to think  that mutualisation is the right way to go, but I am under no illusions about  what it means for governance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a fanciful notion that, every time we want to do  something different in Northern Ireland, we go to the Treasury with a list of  requests and ask whether we can do this or that. That is simply not going to  happen. We have to recognise the circumstances in which we are operating and  the already long list of issues that we have to tackle. There are no  circumstances in which we can make a special case around water that would find  a sympathetic ear in the UK Government. If anything, the finger is pointed at  us with incredulity at the approach that we have taken to the financing of our  water, especially after the severe winter weather in other parts of the UK did not lead to the same absolute and  fundamental breakdown in service that occurred in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can make special cases around issues such as corporation  tax, which is linked to our special economic circumstances. I suggest that, if  we are to have negotiations with the Treasury, we have a short, well-researched  and well-argued list of issues. Whether Conall McDevitt wants to admit it or  not, mutualisation of Northern Ireland Water, which is the right thing to do,  would mean introducing a separate charge for customers. The two go hand in  hand. Mutualising NIW while having a massive subsidy from the state would  essentially mess up the governance arrangements from day one. We would end up  with a repeat of the current unsustainable situation, where we have a  government-owned company that is viewed as unsustainable because the logic of  separate charges was not followed through. The SDLP is proposing to take that  one step further rather than addressing the fundamental issue, the elephant in  the room. Water charging is the most obvious source of revenue that we are not  addressing in Northern    Ireland. The other four parties in this  Chamber are intent on remaining on the hook on which they have placed  themselves rather than biting the bullet over what is an obvious thing to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When Members consider the report from the Finance  Committee, they will see the sheer volume of evidence that we have received  from virtually every economist in Northern Ireland. It has come from  representatives of the business sector, such as CBI and the IoD, all of whom  have said that we must be responsible about revenue raising. Instead &mdash; this  applies across the board &mdash; we have all these other schemes that are untested  and are being promoted as different ways of bringing in revenue. A water  charge, based on the ability to pay and on usage, is a progressive charge. I am  happy to say that we do &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for giving way. At least he is  consistent on the issue. He quoted CBI and the Institute of Directors  and so on, who have talked about the need to raise revenue, but does he accept  that, when there is any suggestion that the revenue to be raised should come  from the particular sector that they have an interest in, those organisations  immediately say that it is not acceptable? They say that business rates should  not go up, that the cap should not be lifted on manufacturing rates and so on.  Everybody comes at this from their own angle and is quite happy for the revenue  raised to be from somebody else and not from them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  There is engagement with the business sector on identifying where revenue can  be raised. The challenge is out there for people who are asking for money to be  spent in other areas to say where that money would come from, so at least there  is that level of engagement. Secondly, there is a desire that we try to free  things up around business costs as far as possible. I do not think it  unreasonable to say that we try to keep overall costs for business as low as we  can, particularly as we are trying to be much more competitive. Thirdly &mdash; this  is where I may disagree slightly with the business community &mdash; in talking about  the future and the opportunity to have a lower rate of corporation tax, one  point that I have made to the Minister is that we need to build in some kind of  contingency around how we would fund it. I appreciate that the Minister has  advised the Committee and will no doubt advise the House that the timescale and  the phasing of that would mean that the actual cost to the block grant over the  next four years would be fairly minimal.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to go down that route, we can make the case to  move money; for example, from state aid, which will come in a different form  from 2013, through Invest Northern Ireland or from elements such as  industrial derating. Essentially, that would be moving resources from a less  efficient form of economic support to a more efficient one through corporation  tax. There is a case to be made, and it is a fairly sophisticated argument. I  will say a few more things about the economy in a few moments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not particularly want to go down the route of last  night again, where the debate simply became about the SDLP and its position.  Last night pretty much turned out to be the St Valentine&rsquo;s Day massacre mark  II. There was not &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Did it not go well when you got home? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  have a very forgiving and understanding wife.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It does not sound like it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: You would need to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Just to be clear, I got home on Tuesday, not Monday.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The direction of travel last night was very much one way.  Even today, we still do not have an explanation of the rationale behind the  amendment and the suggested costings. The SDLP seems to have a fixation with  the idea that Members are attacking it for tabling the amendment. Everyone else  in the Chamber, apart from David McNarry, respects the SDLP&rsquo;s right to table an  amendment. That was not the issue. The issue was that the party, which, the last  time that I checked, was part of the Executive, said that the Executive are  doing this and that, as if it is not part of that Executive. It is trying to  have its fight and make its arguments in the Chamber in advance of its Minister  having discussions around the Executive table. In the event that that does not  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: In  a moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the event that that does not go the right way, the party  should have the integrity to step down from the Executive rather than find  itself in the bizarre situation of being part of the Executive yet not agreeing  with them on the most fundamental decision that faces Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I thank the Member very much for giving way. Does he agree that the Assembly&rsquo;s  key role is to scrutinise the spending of public money? The technical amendment  that the SDLP proposed last night was tabled precisely to try to improve the  first allocation of money for the next financial year, which is part of the  next four-year Budget term. It seems that the Member is suggesting that it is  better to stand by and allow a second-rate Budget in its first part to be  implemented than to try to improve it. For example, the money that we said  should be reallocated from OFMDFM effectively correlates with the amount that  would be allocated to the social investment slush fund that is being set up under  the draft Budget proposals. We are not happy with that, and we absolutely  defend our right to try to improve the proposals and do things differently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  congratulate Mr Callaghan, because, albeit 24 hours late, we finally have some  detail on the amendment. It is a shame that the SDLP did not say such things  when we debated the amendment last night. As the Minister said, the amount of  money that the amendment was going to save was fairly small yet was going to  fund a whole range of things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The much more fundamental problem with what Mr Callaghan  said is that he is speaking as if the SDLP is not part of the Executive. If it  were not part of the Executive, I would respect the party for making the  arguments that it tried to make last night. However, the SDLP is part of the  Executive. If it does not want to be part of the Executive, it can step down  and make its case. The argument has to happen first around the Executive table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, all that we were doing last night was debating  the Supply resolution for the Vote on Account to preauthorise the 45% interim  resources. That is not the formal authorisation of the full year&rsquo;s expenditure.  Indeed, the amendment that the SDLP tried to argue for would have been more  appropriate for the Budget (No. 2) Bill in June.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I find it curious that Mr Farry is trying to tell any other party in the House  what it should or should not do about its membership of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry supported the Good Friday Agreement. I know that  not every Member did, but he certainly did. He was a very vocal and strong  supporter of it. He knows that the Good Friday Agreement provides for the  establishment of a power-sharing Executive, appointed through the d&rsquo;Hondt  process and in accordance with the mandate of the parties. His party is the  only one that is represented at the Executive table because of an exception to  that rule. Every other party there is entitled to be there because of their  mandate. The people voted for them in big enough numbers to allow them to be  there. That is the guiding principle behind the SDLP&rsquo;s membership of the  Executive, and most Ministers would say the same. I accept that Mr Farry cannot  say that because, of course, the Alliance Party serves on the Executive at the  pleasure of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP. However, on behalf of the parties that are  there because of a mandate, frankly, we do not need to take lectures from  anyone about what our people asked us to do, why we serve in government or what  we can do with our power when in government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: Will  the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: Go  ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Mr McDevitt&rsquo;s comments are in total contrast  to what he said at the beginning of his speech at around 11.30 am. He said that  it is time that we moved away from peace process politics. Peace process  politics were all about making sure that the Executive included all the big  parties. They were all about having 108 Members, not for efficiency or delivery  but for political reasons. Is that not in contrast to what Mr McDevitt just  said about defending Belfast Agreement-type politics, rather than, as he said  this morning, moving away from peace process politics?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There are still 20 Members to speak. By wandering off the  subject, you have exhausted my patience, so stick to the subject.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: He has exhausted me, full stop.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That includes you, Minister. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  shall try to respond to those points in the context of the subject. First, the Alliance  Party is at the Executive table based not on the wishes of the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in but on a democratic vote in the House. We are the only party there on that  basis, and, compared to the other parties, that gives us a certain degree of  strength and extra legitimacy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An argument is being made not just in the House by the SDLP  but by all the commentators who criticise the Budget. They are calling for  better connectivity in the Executive and for the end of the silo mentality. I  say to Mr McDevitt that Alex Atwood is at the Executive table, and although his  position may be based on the number of seats that the SDLP has, he is bound by  the ministerial code, which says that, irrespective of whether he votes for or  against the Budget, or even if he abstains, as a Minister, he is bound by the  Executive&rsquo;s collective decision. Based on its current approach, the SDLP will  find itself in a situation in which it has a Minister in the Executive who is  bound by collective responsibility to support the Budget, while, on the  outside, the party is doing something entirely different. You might be able to  get away with that on routine business. However, on the issue that goes right  to the heart of the coherence of any Government, such a situation is completely  unsustainable and bizarre.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The SDLP is the party doing the solo run on this issue and not abiding by the  connectivity and leadership that people are crying out for. Tomorrow, we will  hear the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s stance on its position in the Executive. On  that point, I give way to its excellent deputy leader, who occasionally speaks  the truth.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am just about to do that. I was sorry to hear that the Member&rsquo;s St  Valentine&rsquo;s Night was not all that he had hoped for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member recognise that the Executive and the  legislature are two separate branches of government? If, according to his own  argument, we were always to agree with the Executive, we would not need, as Mr  Ross suggested, 108 MLAs. We would need only about 12, because we would act like  a politburo and just rubber-stamp whatever the Executive said. Where would the  opposition come from? Furthermore, his sister party, the Liberal Democrats, had  difficulties with the way in which its MPs voted on tuition fees, but that did  not bring down the coalition.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  First, the Alliance Party is not the Liberal Democrats. Secondly, the tuition  fees issue was negotiated as part of the coalition agreement, which allows both  parties to take different lines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is confusing the role of a legislature in  scrutinising an Executive with that of parties in a legislature giving a  mandate to an Executive. If parties that are part of the Executive withdraw  their support on the Floor of the Assembly on the most important decisions,  which go to the heart of the coherence of the Executive, the whole credibility  of government falls apart, and the credibility of that party&rsquo;s participation in  government falls apart. That is the problem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, having heard what we have heard over the past  number of hours, this debate is the best advertisement for a move towards a  voluntary coalition and away from a mandatory coalition in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is the final straw. We must get back to the debate on the  Budget Bill. That is the end of it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  accept your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have had a good innings around the  wider structural points.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s perspective is that it wants to  support the final Budget that the Executive will, hopefully, agree in March and  bring to the Assembly. We are in the process of scrutinising the draft Budget  and making our points clear. This is about trying to influence decisions that  will be taken in due course. Today, I will focus on themes that it is important  that we take into account in formulating those decisions. I will address the  current profile of public expenditure in Northern Ireland and how we can do  things differently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the merits of having in place a proper  Programme for Government. I have no difficulty in saying that, procedurally, we  are not going about the Budget in the ideal way. It is arguable that the  employment of best practice in the most difficult of cases is probably more  relevant than doing so in a situation of economic growth. However, we are where  we are, and we have to move on from there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even in the absence of a Programme for Government, it is  important that we, as far as possible, encourage a strategic approach to what  we are trying to do and that we promote collaboration between Departments. I am  critical of what I regard as 12 independent departmental spending plans of much  and variable detail that are not tied together well or at all. We are missing  opportunities collectively to do things better through collaborating and avoiding  inefficiencies in the system. There is a beggar&ndash;thy-neighbour approach by  Ministers of passing costs on to other Departments while trying to find savings  in their own.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the issue of the economy, which is probably the  most important theme that we need to focus on as an Assembly. Some of the key  economic aspects of the draft Budget are disproportionate cuts for DETI and DEL, the two main  economic-facing Departments; the need for some reallocation of moneys from  current to capital expenditure; and issues around some of our other economic  support mechanisms. Equally, there is the pressure of protecting the Health  Service. The sheer scale of protection that we are affording the Health Service  and the Health Minister&rsquo;s desire for us to give much more firm protection will  always lead to a trade-off. Although we say that we are supporting the economy,  the figures suggest that, in truth, we are protecting the Health Service, doing  what we can for the economy, and every other area of investment is suffering  disproportionately. We have choices. Although we have a degree of focus on the  economy, it is not as clean or as clear-cut as it should be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to see the shift from current to capital  expenditure going further and happening on a strategic rather than an  individual departmental level. There is a lot of talk about the need for the  Budget to protect jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When a lot of politicians talk about protecting jobs on the  back of the Budget, they are talking about protecting public sector jobs. People  are not thinking about overall levels of employment in the economy. The  education sector is a clear example of that, where the Minister of Education  talks about shifting moneys out of capital into current, essentially to defend  the status quo and partly to defend employment. That may have merit. At the  same time, taking that money out of capital has an impact on the construction  sector. We have to ask ourselves where the greater employment prospects lie or  where the greater harm to employment will be, and a clear argument is emerging,  particularly from the Construction Employers Federation, about the negative  multiplier effect. It argues that cuts from capital budgets will have an even  bigger impact through job losses or the failure to recreate jobs in the  construction sector and that that in turn will have an even greater negative  multiplier effect on the consequences for the service sector, for retail and  for jobs elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is right for Members to focus on the public  sector and the needs of people whom we directly employ, it is also important to  look at the bigger picture and understand that sometimes the measures that we  take to protect the public sector &mdash; we may pat ourselves on the shoulder for  what we have done &mdash; in turn might have even bigger negative consequences in the  wider community. We need to think about employment in an overarching sense  rather than simply focusing on the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need a greater focus on benchmarking. Before  Christmas, I tabled a whole set of questions to Departments to ask what they  are doing to compare the profile of their expenditure with that in other  regions in the rest of the UK.  The answers were extremely disappointing. Only some Departments were doing any  benchmarking exercises at all, and those were very piecemeal. We have to look  at what we are doing in Northern    Ireland and try to learn lessons from that.  For example, there are areas in which we spend disproportionately more on  health than the rest of the UK,  which in turn means that we spend less on other aspects than in the rest of the  UK.  We need to analyse all those differentials and decide whether they are  justified in light of our local circumstances or whether they point to  something much more fundamental and to major inefficiencies. I urge all  Ministers to do that, and I urge the Executive to push Ministers in that  regard. Perhaps the performance and efficiency delivery unit (PEDU) can play a  role in encouraging that. I also mentioned that we do not have any ideological difficulty  with market testing but that it works only where it is relevant and a solution  is available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to look at prevention and early intervention.  Doing something early often means doing it at a much lower cost and avoiding  costly problems down the line. However, it involves a certain leap of faith to  shift resources, and I fear that, for many Departments, a decreasing cake means  circling the wagons around what they view as core services. Early intervention  and prevention are often seen as optional extras that can be cut, and there is  a real danger that that becomes a false economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want the Executive to push the North/South agenda  more proactively. I was quite amazed that, in a contribution that lasted an  hour and a half, Conall McDevitt did not once mention North/South  opportunities, which seems an obvious gap. We have two Governments on the island of Ireland, both of which are going through  considerable budgetary and financial difficulties. No one in the House,  irrespective of his or her political background &mdash; whether that be as a member  of a unionist, nationalist or cross-community party such as ours &mdash; should fear  the financial and economic logic of trying to provide shared services. There  are shared services through investment in some of the roads infrastructure. It  is important that that does not become a straitjacket that ends up skewing our  budgets inappropriately simply because the money is coming through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are major untapped opportunities, particularly in an  area such as health, and I would hate a situation to develop in which the two  Governments on the island become inward-looking rather than looking to those  opportunities. I appreciate the fact that that has been touched on loosely  through the North/South Ministerial Council, but it needs to be followed  through meaningfully during the lifespan of the coming Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will mention another issue. However, I will not go into  it in great detail because, no doubt, Members can guess what I am going to say.  We have said it every time that we have made a Budget speech, and, no doubt, we  will say it again in every future Budget speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Cost of division?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Very good. Star pupil. Mr McDevitt followed through on Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s comments  about the Alliance Party and CSI. If the SDLP cares so deeply about overcoming  divisions in society, it is strange that, during a very long speech on  budgetary matters, that party&rsquo;s representative did not address the issue of  finding savings from promoting sharing. I find it bewildering that its attack  rhetoric is not followed through with any substance. I appreciate that there is  no silver bullet for addressing the cost of division overnight, but it is a  journey that we have to undertake to make this society more sustainable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned already the need to look at revenue raising. We  are not raising revenue in Northern Ireland  to the same levels as elsewhere in the UK, and that has a consequence for  the amount of money that is available to us. I recognise, as do we all, that  the CSR settlement for Northern    Ireland was very unfair and that we have to  strike a local Budget whether we like it or not. However, due to the failure to  bite the bullet, particularly around the most obvious areas of revenue raising,  we are making an already difficult situation even worse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is nothing to fear from openly, honestly and  realistically making the case for progressive taxation so that households that  can afford to pay a little more are asked to do so, meaning that we can have  better public services. The consequences of not doing that will be  underinvestment in our public services, and it is the poor and the most  vulnerable who depend disproportionately on public services. The Health Service  is a clear example. The areas with the worst public health and the lowest life  expectancy are also the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland, so that case is  very strong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that I have spoken for slightly longer than I  anticipated, but I got waylaid slightly at the start. In closing, I will focus  briefly on two areas. One is health, which is important, given the degree of  public controversy on which we have all tried to give our views. The other area  is education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand where the Health Minister is coming from when  he says that he does not have enough money in his budget. I appreciate that, in  the past, Northern Ireland  spent more per head than other UK  regions and that that has now changed due to the financing of recent years. He  is perfectly entitled to make that case. I would like him to make it in a  constructive way, but that is another story. There could be a shortfall of &pound;1  billion by 2014-15 with the current policies and practices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Health Minister makes the case that there has  to be parity in health spending across the UK,  unlike his colleague John McCallister he is not prepared to be honest in saying  that the same UK  standards are needed on revenue raising. We cannot run public services in Northern Ireland  on the cheap; the Health Minister, in not being intellectually honest and  following through with his argument, is trying to get that across. That is a  major flaw in his argument. If he were prepared to be brave, he would find that  he had much greater sympathy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a choice to make. The full protection that the  Minister and others seem to want can be given to the entire health budget, but  that will come at a major cost to a whole host of other spending priorities across  government, including the economy. Anyone who makes the case for giving health  100% protection is saying, essentially, that we are forgetting about the  prospect of any economic growth in Northern Ireland and that we are satisfied  with Northern Ireland becoming a financial dependency of the Treasury, where we  simply have a handout from London in a dependency culture in which people work  in the public sector and where we do not rebalance the economy. That is the  consequence of going down the route of capping the resources that are  available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also lose the opportunity of that full protection to  challenge the health sector on inefficiencies. The notion that there are no  inefficiencies in a Budget in excess of &pound;4 billion is completely false. I  referred to the need to carry out a proper benchmarking exercise and to compare  the profile of budgets, particularly the health budget, with other regions.  That will illuminate where disproportionate amounts of money are spent in the  health sector and where there is underinvestment, so that changes can be made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to take into account other factors, including  demographics, more expensive treatments, more expensive drugs and increased  technology. All those areas create pressures. That means that we have to change  a whole host of policies and practices in the health sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The view of the Alliance Party is that we must challenge  the health sector. Today, its position is set in stone and it receives full  funding at the expense of everything else, but that cannot continue. At the  same time, we should encourage the Health Service to change, to be more modern,  and to be much more productive because we cannot do everything.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member accept that the Health Service is the one public service that  fulfilled its obligations under the review of public administration?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Yes, but that is a small point in the overall scheme of things, and many other  issues in the Health Service have not been faced up to. Although I am happy to  acknowledge the point about the RPA, to overly praise the Minister for one  small victory is to detract from what has become an extremely poisonous debate  on health. In recent years, massive problems in the Health Service have been  swept under the carpet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was also disappointed with the approach taken to spending  plans for education. I referred to the reallocation of capital to current  budgets. Education is an area in which there are clear opportunities for doing  things differently, such as the rationalisation of the school estate and the  promotion of shared and integrated education. That does not mean opting for the  pure model of integrated schools in every situation, but there are menus of  different models of shared education. If we are more ambitious in delivering  change in the education system, we will reduce the costs. Until we are prepared  to do that, we will be pouring money into an inefficient and unsustainable  situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  For the record, Members may think that I dealt with all the Budget issues in my  contribution, but I did not, and other colleagues will return to the cost of  division and to North/South and east-west issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry raises an important point, and I agree with him.  When we look at shared faith schools and the way in which the debate has moved  on in the past couple of years, a real new area of conversation is opening up.  However, if we were serious about promoting that in public finance terms, we  would be using the Budget as an opportunity to demand change. Why does the  Member not join us in expressing his serious reservations about the Budget? It  clearly does not meet the tests that his party would apply to public policy for  it to be able to deliver the sort of outcomes on which his party campaigns. Why  does he not join us in saying that it is not good enough?</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  agree with the first half of what Mr McDevitt said, but I caution against  jumping off a cliff with the SDLP based on its current approach to the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Over the past 36 hours, I listened to the debate on the Budget and the  financial position. I listened particularly to the SDLP. The position is not  good enough, because there is a &pound;4 billion deficit. However, what is missing  from the debate is any detail of what Conall McDevitt wants the rest of the  Assembly to sign up to. That is where the gap is. There is a &pound;4 billion deficit  in the Budget, but there is a deficit in what the SDLP wants us to sign up to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Well &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  will respond to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd first, and then I will give the Member a chance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a degree of truth in what Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said. No one  in the Assembly wants to be in the current situation. Every party here, with  the possible exception of UCUNF, argued against deep cuts in public expenditure  at a UK-wide level and highlighted the dangers of a disproportionate cut for  areas such as Northern Ireland that were in a difficult financial situation.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have been given a CSR Budget that is well short of what  is needed, so difficult choices have to be made. I accept my responsibility,  and I know that David Ford, as a Minister and a member of the Executive,  accepts his. Even in these difficult circumstances, the last thing that we  should do is run away from that responsibility, say that it is far too  difficult, or simply stand on the sidelines and produce a mythical argument on  how things could be better rather than fight our case to find collective,  shared solutions to protect public services and grow the economy as best we  can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could, like Mr McDevitt, go through an entire list of  things that relate to the structure and process of the Budget and how things  could be done differently on spending. The Alliance Party&rsquo;s approach is about  making this place work while acknowledging that there has to be a vote on a  four-year Budget before the end of the term. We are committed to working the  system and, through the Executive, seeing what changes we can make to the  Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate Mr Farry&rsquo;s giving way. I want to address the important point that  Mr O&rsquo;Dowd made. I refer him to page 61 of my party&rsquo;s &lsquo;Partnership and Economic  Recovery&rsquo; document where he will see a fully costed table that identifies &pound;0&middot;5  billion of new revenue opportunities. That is what my party wants to see in the  Budget. I refer Mr O&rsquo;Dowd to his own party&rsquo;s Budget submission, which is a bit  limp. It is seven pages long. I know that not everyone is keen on tables, but  his party&rsquo;s Budget submission has no figures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Here is the deal: the Assembly could raise a further &pound;0&middot;5  billion, yet we have not even started to debate that. Rather, we are settling  into a cosy consensus between Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and &mdash; sometimes in, sometimes  out &mdash; the Alliance Party in favour of delivering Tory cuts. My party wants to challenge  that. There are half a billion reasons why you could challenge it, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd.  Why do you not sit down and do something about it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd, would you like to respond?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  First, the document that the Member referred to is not a Budget submission; it  contains economic proposals that were produced six to seven weeks before the  SDLP produced its document. Those documents contain two sets of proposals.  Every party around the table has produced proposals for the way forward. What  we have to do &mdash; and I agree with Mr McDevitt on this &mdash; is raise alternative  sources of revenue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past number of days, I have listened to deep  criticism of the Minister of Education from the SDLP Benches. When she says  that she would like to bid for additional resources, the SDLP says that those  resources do not exist and that it does not make economic sense for any  Minister to talk in such terms. If SDLP Members say in response to the draft  Budget that revenue should be raised from alternative sources, we will agree  with them wholeheartedly. We will work our way towards that. Indeed, the  Executive&rsquo;s Budget review group is meeting to bring forward proposals to do  exactly that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  OK. I shall return. The SDLP still needs to clarify whether the Budget is a  carve-up between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in or whether, with regard to the wonderful  document that it produced at the eleventh hour, all the good bits that they  have identified in the Budget are their ideas alone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. How many times do my colleagues and I have  to tell the Alliance Party and the representatives of other parties that we  originally made proposals in April 2009? Some of those proposals dealt with  revenue raising, some with assets, and some with the re-profiling of  expenditure. We did that 20 months ago &mdash; long before any other party. I recall  that when I was a member of the Executive, some of those ideas were cogged by  the Executive. In fact, I recall the First Minister being particularly  reflective about them. When we published our document on 8 or 9 December 2010,  it was simply an elaboration and expansion of those ideas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We were long at the trough before any other party.  Please acknowledge that point.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am very happy to acknowledge the point made by the leader of the SDLP. In her  argument, she has, in essence, confirmed and answered the question that I  posed: is this a carve-up or an SDLP budget? After 24 hours of attacking the  Budget, the SDLP has essentially argued that it is an SDLP budget, that all of  the good ideas in it were developed years and years ago by the SDLP and that  the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have simply absorbed them and reflected that in the  Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  It seems that the Member has some difficulty with the concept of time. The  document that my party leader referred to was published in April 2009. The  draft Budget was published by the Executive before Christmas. At the time, the  Minister referred to it, erroneously, as a Christmas present for the people of  the North. Some of the proposals published by us in April 2009 were picked up,  in some form, in the current draft Budget, and some of them had been in the  public domain. The plastic bag levy, for instance, was in our 2007 manifesto. I  say that for the benefit of the not-present Finance Committee Chairperson. The  proposals included dealing with senior civil servants&rsquo; bonus payments; Senior  Civil Service recruitment and promotion; the two-year moratorium on Civil  Service recruitment; dealing with consultancy costs; the reform of the Planning  Service; a levy on telephone masts &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member return to the debate on the Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  These are documents in the current draft Budget, Mr Deputy Speaker. There were  also proposals on reprofiling the Housing Executive debt; the sale and disposal  of publicly owned car parks; the sale and lease back of the Housing Executive  headquarters; and capital receipts from Belfast port. We are not happy that  they have been picked up in the appropriate way, but they are some of the  issues that were in our paper from 22 months ago and which are being picked up  now to some extent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should also bear in mind that our proposals in  2009 were to deal with a quantum of just over &pound;400 million. As the Member  should be aware from the debates in the House over the past 48 hours and in the  community over the past two or three months, and longer, the bridge that we  must cross now amounts to &pound;4 billion. Even if every one of our April 2009  proposals was picked up, there would still be a gap of over &pound;3&middot;5 billion to be  bridged. Of course, every one of the proposals has not been picked up and, in  nearly two years, we have not heard a good reason why they were not picked up  at the time and why those opportunities were squandered. To suggest that  because some of our ideas were picked up in the Budget &mdash; even incompletely and  not properly &mdash; that that somehow makes it an SDLP budget beggars belief,  particularly given the range of further measures that have been introduced.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that interventions should be short and to the  point. Mr Farry, you have the Floor again.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The irony of a lecture on the Alliance Party not understanding time is stark  for all to absorb. I return to the simple point that I made yesterday that this  was a DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in carve-up. Today it is an SDLP budget, or a partial SDLP  budget, or a budget where all the good ideas are SDLP ideas and all the bad  ideas are those of others. If an idea has been picked up by anyone other than  the SDLP, it will not be implemented properly. There is a very confusing  message coming out with regard to whether the SDLP is in or out, whether it has  influence, or whether something is being imposed upon it. The notion that we  still have a &pound;3&middot;5 billion deficit to face up to is there for everyone; no one  is denying that. We are all conscious of the reason why we are trying to agree  a difficult Budget that is going to cause a lot of pain to people. However, we  have to ask ourselves whether people are prepared to stand up, take tough  decisions and be part of a collective Executive working the issue, or whether  people are going to walk away and play games.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: If  some of our Members were to have a sponsored talk, there would be no such thing  as a deficit; we would have all the money that we need in the Budget. We find  ourselves in a very difficult place, which was not of our own doing. The Tory  plan was to reduce the Budget deficit, and, in real terms, that meant that Northern Ireland  was to be faced with cuts of 8% in current expenditure and some 40% in capital  investment by 2014-15.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, given the fact that the Executive is made up of  five political parties that, in many ways, have belief structures and  ideologies that go in completely different directions, it is an achievement in  itself that we have been able to agree the draft Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today, the Finance Minister, Sammy Wilson &mdash; he can  speak for himself, of course &mdash; spoke about a present at Christmas. He was  talking about the fact that our business community, our private sector, our  public sector, the community out there &mdash; the whole population &mdash; was crying out  for the Executive to agree a Budget, and they did agree a Budget. In addition  to that, it was a four-year draft Budget, which people, even in this House,  said was impossible to do. We agreed a four-year Budget in order to plan ahead  and for businesses and communities to stabilise themselves. In a time of  recession and hardship, they were able to plan ahead on a four-year basis. That  cannot be discounted out of hand, and we must commend the Executive for the  fact that we have got to this point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that our people are ready and prepared,  especially in the public sector, to take a limited amount of pain in that  regard. Of course, it would be limited further by a good Budget. I believe that  people in the public sector are prepared for a pay freeze, because they have  seen how the private sector has been decimated. They have seen how the construction  industry has been wiped out by 25%, people have taken pay cuts of up to 15%,  and other people have lost jobs. I believe that there is a belief out there  that, by taking a pay freeze, they can save jobs in the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The responsibility and role of the Executive and the reason  we have devolution is to minimise the impact of the like of budgetary cuts. The  Executive&rsquo;s strategic aims should be to protect the most vulnerable in society  and to give priority to promoting the growth of a dynamic economy. The whole  point of devolution is that local Ministers will make local decisions &mdash; hard  decisions &mdash; and it is good to see local Ministers making decisions, being held  to account by their Departments&rsquo; Committees and standing up for their  decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That has not been helped by Departments dragging their  heels on publishing spending plans and saving plans that enable us, the elected  Members here, and, indeed, the public to see the detail and to make up our own  minds regarding the draft Budget. It does not stop Ministers from making wrong  decisions or no decisions at all, which is even worse. Ministers must accept  the massive responsibilities upon them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One decision that comes to mind is the decision by the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to cut funding to the Young  Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster by 100%. That has been an easy decision that will have  terrible consequences for the young farmers&rsquo; clubs and their members, for the  sake of &pound;75,000 a year, which will be lost in some other massive pot. Young  farmers&rsquo; clubs provide essential services to young people living and working in  rural communities. It is very important that younger people are retained within  what is deemed to be an ageing industrial sector. It is not just for farmers  but for everyone who lives in rural areas. The president of the Young Farmers&rsquo;  Clubs of Ulster (YFCU), Thoburn McCaughey, has said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;News of the funding cuts comes at a time when the  YFCU has seen a year on year increases in participation rates across the full  range of training and education services it provides directly for members  across its agriculture, arts and culture portfolios. And the proposed cuts  would also put at risk a series of crucial initiatives the Association is  currently delivering including its high profile Rural Road Safety campaign and Family  Farm Succession awareness raising programme.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">The financial resources provided by DARD are core to  all of the success of the YFCU over the past three years. In carrying out our  work we have always sought to ensure that we are complementing the Departments  own strategic goals, for example, strengthening the social and economic  infrastructure of rural areas and enhancing animal and plant health and  welfare. And for this reason we find the proposals even more astonishing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was at a recent event in Ballymena town hall in my  constituency of North Antrim where  Lisnamurrican Young Farmers&rsquo; Club was putting on a production of &lsquo;Robin Hood  and his Musical Merry Men&rsquo;. I see that he has left the Chamber, but Conall  McDevitt, who himself likes a good drama and can make a very good drama out of  a crisis, would have loved the production.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The club was celebrating its seventieth anniversary, and in  the play were people ranging from 50 to 60 years of age to toddlers, who are  not even at school yet but who danced about the stage and were part of  something very special. The decision that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development made will destroy something very special in the rural community,  which she, as a Minister, is meant to protect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another aspect of the Budget that I wish to deal with is  the Presbyterian Mutual Society. I welcome the assistance package for that. It  is incumbent on the Executive to ensure that the use of public money to assist  PMS will see a just and fair resolution for all, particularly smaller savers.  We need clarity on how smaller savers could be prioritised in the scheme. If  the Minister is going to respond to anything in my contribution, I ask that it  be to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have welcomed the transfer from current to capital  expenditure, and I find it unsettling that some Ministers are trying to claw  back in the other direction. I hope that they will know and be sure of their  own briefs when they talk about what the consequences of that will be. The  transfer from current to capital will, of course, assist the construction  industry at a time when it has suffered so much, with the loss of at least  21,000 jobs and a 25% reduction in contracting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that some Ministers are likely to have an  adverse impact on preventative spending through their budgets. Such spending  will save money in the long run, and it would be an easy decision for some  Departments to cut it away. However, that will cost thousands, even millions,  of pounds in the long run.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a time for hard choices. I have no doubt about  that. However, it is also a time when there is an opportunity to rebalance the  economy and to bring this country to a better place so that, when there is real  recovery, Northern Ireland will be much fitter, leaner and less reliant. It  will also be in a position to move forward to best serve our people, protect  our most vulnerable, enhance our economy, make lives better and increase confidence  in our people, because confidence is the key.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whenever I hear debates such as this and see Ministers&rsquo;  attitudes, I sometimes wonder why, instead of negotiating at the Executive  table, they are negotiating on the airwaves or in the pages of our newspapers.  I ask myself how that affects our people and damages their confidence.  Certainly, it does not have a positive effect. I ask all Ministers to withdraw  from doing that and to get back round the Executive table and negotiate and  barter for the thousands and millions of pounds that they say they need to make  their Departments much better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will end here, because I do not want to keep things  going. I also want to talk about how the green new deal will assist the  construction industry by retrofitting houses. We know of many skilled people  who are unemployed and are ready to go with that instantly. It is not just  about employment; it will improve the capital housing stock, help to reduce  fuel policy and advance renewable energy at a time when we are trying to reach  40% renewable energy targets by 2020.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am done, and I hope that the Members who speak after me  will take a leaf out of my book.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Your immediate predecessor in that  seat, Mr Deputy Speaker, announced that there was a list of 20 speakers when he  was exhorting the then contributor, Mr McDevitt, to get a move on. I was here  to 12.30 am last night, and my heart sank to my boots when I heard that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I started wondering how many of the 20 would be SDLP  Members and how many interventions by SDLP Members, which end up being five or  10 minute contributions, it would include. I then began to wonder whether I  should start to make arrangements to stay overnight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be helpful to remind ourselves what we are doing  here today. The Budget Bill provides the statutory authority for expenditure,  as set out in the spring Supplementary Estimates. It also provides for the Vote  on Account. All of that is part of the budgetary process and is valid. I have  two particular questions about the contributions that have been made and the  repetition. I do not intend to indulge in repetition, if at all possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Listening to the SDLP, in particular, I have noted the  absence of the Official Unionists throughout, particularly their Health  Minister, given the many references to the issues surrounding health and the  response to the very real pressures that exist in that Department. There have  been many protestations of sympathy for the dilemma that the Health Minister  faces, and this seems to be a good opportunity to work in a more collective and  collaborative way. Some Ministers have endured pain in terms of their  departmental budgets, or at least the indicative allocations to them, because  they want to be supportive of the Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am puzzled by the SDLP&rsquo;s argument that there has been a  carve-up. SDLP Members have often contradicted themselves through the rhetoric  that they have then deployed, particularly in their claims to have originated  most of the positive proposals for revenue-raising.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Constantly reminding people of their minority status here  does not seem to be very sensible. SDLP Members seem to be locked into a mode  of victimhood, and they look for examples of oppression, denial of their rights  or denial of any consideration of their ideas or those of others. That is not  the case, and it is not the way that we should be proceeding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is wrong for them to deny that we can point to some  genuine achievements in very difficult circumstances that have not been of the  Assembly&rsquo;s creation, particularly when it comes to global economics, but have  had a direct impact. As a collective, sometimes with Ministers acting  independently and sometimes after the emergence of a semi-detached attitude, we  have managed to bring forward good examples of Ministers working together and  addressing realities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If huge lumps have been lifted out of the block grant, as  had been projected, it is a reality. People then have to consider how they can  practically respond and oppose the implications of that reduction in the  capital and resource funding of the Executive. That is a big challenge,  particularly for a coalition of five parties. That would be difficult for a  single-party Government or a minority Government that relied either on a  smaller party or on independents to function, but it would not be as difficult  as the five parties in this coalition attempting to find a methodology and a  way through the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget document in front of us is the result of  collective effort and the harvesting of ideas from the diverse range of parties  that are represented here and stakeholders in our community. The consultation  on the draft document will produce even more ideas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have talked at length about the system that we have  devised, and I will not repeat myself, but the Budget review group is a very  effective response. It may not be the definitive response, but it is a very  effective response and an opportunity, on the basis of the equal standing of  Ministers dealing with these issues around the table, to process, examine and  develop proposals that will feed into the final Budget document.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should work at that. I am not saying that we must  celebrate it, but the Budget review process, however it is refined over time,  could be one of the legacies of this term. We have moved from the position four  years ago of quite disparate perspectives and expectations to having completed  the first full term of this Assembly. In the process, we have demonstrated that  we did respond and that we are responsive. However, we can improve the process  and we should continue to improve it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Promoting the idea of two parties as victims of a wider  conspiracy, because they are smaller parties, does not help them or give  confidence to the community. All the parties will be contesting an election  soon, and we will be judged on our political decisions, whether they were good,  bad or indifferent. That will be the electorate&rsquo;s opportunity to establish  their primacy, and to either endorse the direction of travel that the Executive  have taken or to give us a severe reminder that they are displeased.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should examine the powers that we have and what we can  do more of. We should also examine the ideas for revenue raising and the ideas  of those outside the Assembly who think that it is easier than it actually is.  I have a wry smile on hearing some of the statements that come from the  business community, because, as was mentioned by the Member who spoke  previously, the downturn in our economy is characterised more by a failure in  the private sector than in the public sector. In the public sector, we have  continued to see public services delivered in a mainly efficient manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scrutiny Committees have also begun to develop their skills  of forensic interrogation of the spending programmes and the performance and  efficiencies that their respective Departments are delivering or failing to  deliver. They have also become much more assertive in their statutory powers,  which is all to the good. However, some of those from without this Assembly who  think that they know all of the answers do not know very many of the answers,  judging from their own performance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a value in the exchange of ideas and the  consultation on the Budget, even if it was in a constricted time period. I hope  that those people took the opportunity to respond. I have not seen either the  volume or the quality of the responses, but those responses will be reflected  on and perused by Ministers. From that, we will get a document that is based on  the practical experience of managing with the resources that we have and of  developing and exploring resources that are not presently available to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the next term will proceed on the basis of  seeking additional powers, as I have argued for during this term. I think that  we have the answers to the problems ourselves and, as we develop a more  comfortable working relationship with each other over time, the harvesting and  implementation of those ideas through agreed programmes will be the way forward  for us all. I hope that I have kept my contribution as short as I intended.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: In  the two Committees of which I am a member, we looked at how the draft Budget  will impact on services. I will touch on those discussions first.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Key to the considerations of the Committee for Justice was  the bid by the Chief Constable to access the Treasury reserves, which was part  of the devolutionary settlement. Some reassurance was given that that money  will be forthcoming, and we just need the fine detail on it. However, based on  the assumption that we will get that money, we should be able to deliver the  necessary services that the public require. With that in mind, it was  regrettable that the SDLP tabled its amendment to the Supply resolution  yesterday to take &pound;7 million from the Department of Justice budget. The  Executive have, rightly, ring-fenced the Department of Justice&rsquo;s recurrent and  capital expenditure. They have also provided assistance beyond that, and have  placed the right emphasis on helping our police to tackle the dissident  republican threat that exists.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We should never be complacent, and it is  regrettable that the SDLP wanted to remove &pound;7 million from that budget.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment looked at how the Budget will impact on its work and found  that it will allow a lot of the good work that has taken place to continue.  Invest NI raised the need for a similar type of scheme as that put in place for  the Department of Education with regard to schools, with some kind of  end-year-flexibility mechanism. Because Invest NI interfaces with the private  sector in a much greater way than any other organisation, the nature of the  deals and contracts that are being sought are not similar to other public  sector organisations. Invest NI suggested that it could manage its allocated  budget with that type of facility. However, Invest NI expressed some concern  that the absence of that type of mechanism could create problems. Hopefully,  that area is being looked at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has made a contribution to a lot of schemes in  my constituency over the past few years. A vast number of new primary schools  have been built, particularly in rural areas where we amalgamated a large  number of small schools. We were able to do that because we were creating  newbuilds, which made it a lot easier for communities to buy into. A decision  was taken to give the Department of Education a capital allocation, which would  go some way to allow new schools to be built in my constituency, particularly Dromore Central Primary School,  which has been one of the top priorities for the Southern Education and Library  Board. Almost &pound;8 million has been spent in buying the land and designing the  scheme, and we now need to put the contracts in place to allow the school to be  built. However, there is some concern that the decision taken by the Minister  of Education to put that capital into recurrent will not allow those types of  projects to go ahead. That is one school; we have other urban schools that  require newbuild facilities, and I will continue to press for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also have concern over proposals around our hospital  provision. A major capital scheme has been proposed for the Lagan Valley   Hospital site, and there  are concerns that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has not allowed the trust to go ahead and commission the work. In the current  environment when capital expenditure will be scarce, there is real fear that  the planned projects will not go ahead, and that will be looked at in the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lisburn also has a very large health centre serving a large  population. Ideally, it would be better if we had smaller health centres in the  city area, one in the Lisburn north part and one in Lisburn south, rather than  one very large central facility. I declare an interest as I use that health  centre. When I seek an appointment with my GP, it is usually well over a week  before I can see my preferred doctor. It is usually then at least a couple of  days before I can get an appointment. Obviously, that is for non-emergency  situations. That difficulty has been highlighted by the local community and  funding is needed to look at how we can address that problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lisburn city centre is in need of a boost from the  Department for Social Development for its public realm scheme. In conjunction  with DSD, the council has created the master plan; indeed, I think that former  Minister Ritchie launched that master plan. However, we now need the funding.  Our city centre has suffered, particularly since the expansion of the Bow  Street Mall, which is drawing the footfall away from the traditional Market Square area  and taking it to the Bow Street  area. The traders are keen to ensure that the new public realm scheme is put in  place to try to attract people back to that part of the city centre. That is  another reason why we have campaigned hard for the John Lewis and Westfield application.  The council has taken a view that the income generated in rates from that  development could be used to invest in the city centre, because there is some  concern among the traders as to how it would impact on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our roads infrastructure is in need of more investment,  particularly at the Sprucefield and Hillsborough roundabout junctions. There  are plans for a link road to be built in and around the back of Marks and  Spencer to connect the M1 directly to the A1 dual carriageway, which would save  motorists from having to navigate those roundabouts. The chronic traffic  congestion impacts on those who want to come in and out of Lisburn from the  Hillsborough, Dromore and Banbridge areas. DRD has that link road in its plan  but, again, there is concern that the capital funding will not be there for it  to be built.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why is the capital funding, which is a primary concern for  a lot of the schemes that I want to go forward in Lagan Valley,  not there? It is because it was not allocated to us in the block grant. We have  had to live within the resources allocated to us, and there are well-rehearsed  arguments as to how that came about. The Labour Government, who have a sister  party here, spent well beyond their means, and then the Conservative Party  decided to cut too quickly and too deeply, and we are suffering the  consequences. The Conservative Party also reneged on the &pound;18 billion agreement,  and we are now suffering from the consequences of that, too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the sister organisations in the House, the  Ulster Unionists and the Alliance Party. If their associations were of any  meaningful use to Northern    Ireland, they should have been able to exert  some influence. However, that has evidently not been the case. Despite telling  people to go out and vote for their parties in the last Westminster election &mdash;  they are not neutral on the Union but in favour of Northern Ireland staying  within the United Kingdom &mdash; we saw exactly the colour of their money when it  came to the Budget that was allocated to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the pretence of the Ulster Unionist Party and  the SDLP engaging in a charade in which they are in the Executive but not part  of it. They snipe from the sidelines and do not take seriously the collective  responsibility of having Executive Ministers. They lambast the Finance Minister  and other Ministers on the radio but do not engage in meaningful conversation,  and when invited to do so, they decline to take up those opportunities. People  will see through that. People are not fools, and political parties who treat  the electorate as fools will suffer the consequences of holding people in  contempt. There will be an opportunity for the people to demonstrate that in  the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Others took seriously their ministerial responsibility,  engaged seriously and sought to mitigate the cuts from Westminster  for which the Ulster Unionist Party, in particular, campaigned heavily at the  last Westminster  election. I look forward to the opportunity to make that case on the doorstep.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I will begin by replying to some of the nonsense from Mr Givan in his closing  remarks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at how we got into this mess. For 13 years, a  Labour Government overspent and left the Treasury with no money, as the note  left for its new Chief Secretary outlined. Mr Givan wonders why an incoming  Government would have to cut public spending. He then goes on to say that we &mdash;  the sister party, the Ulster Unionist Party or however he wants to refer to us  &mdash; are to blame for the Tory cuts. We stood and told people the truth about it.  What about Mr Givan&rsquo;s colleague, the MP for Lagan Valley,  who said that he would not accept a penny?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We did not get anyone elected, but we went out and told  people the truth. He is expecting us to have influence. You are the guys who  won the seats at Westminster,  but what influence do you have there? You went out and told the electorate to  vote for you because you would have influence at Westminster. You said that you could change  things, stop the incoming Tory Government and do this, that and the other. Your  eight MPs made not a jot of difference to that system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must make his comments through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The way in which we arrived at this situation is fundamental to this debate.  The DUP has had no influence over the Budget process at Westminster. It says one thing here and does  another at Westminster,  and we can see that in the tuition fees debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main issue that I want to address involves the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, on which I sit. I  heard Mr Givan shouting about Tory cuts, but this is the bit that I would like  the Minister of Finance and Personnel to address when he gets to his feet. I  was one of the candidates who stood as a Conservative and Unionist. One of the  best commitments that we gave was that we would protect health spending. Health  spending has been protected in England,  Wales and Scotland. The  coalition Government stuck to that agreement, yet that has not been passed on  to the Health Department in Northern    Ireland, according to the Department and the  Assembly Research and Library Service. I would like the Minister to address  that in his response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: If the Member wants my response now, I am quite  happy to give it. Let us look at the figures for the next year, because Scotland and Wales have not been able to give a  four-year deal to their health services. We are the only Administration that  have given a four-year deal. In Scotland  next year, there will be a reduction of 0&middot;3%; in Wales,  there will be a reduction of 2&middot;5%; in Northern Ireland, the reduction  will be 0&middot;3%. We have given the same deal. In England, over the four-year period,  a commitment has been made to protect spending in real terms by 0&middot;4%. Our protection  is 0&middot;2% over the four years, but we have not imposed the 5% efficiencies, which  amount to &pound;20 billion, that have been imposed on the Health Service in England  over the four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked for the information: in those terms, we  have given better protection and forward planning opportunities to the Health  Service in Northern Ireland than has been given in Scotland or Wales and,  overall, over the four-year period, in England. We have lived up to the  commitment, despite the reductions in our Budget that the Member talked about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Last night, I pressed the Chairperson of the Health Committee to read out the  Committee&rsquo;s response. This is the view of the Committee:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Committee received a briefing paper from the  Assembly Research Service which indicated that if the same percentage changes  that were allocated to health in England were applied to the DHSSPS  baseline, it would be in line to receive an additional &pound;458 million revenue  over the 4 year budget period&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In fairness to the Minister, I will finish the  quotation:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;but would lose &pound;137 million on the capital side.  However, the total net increase would be &pound;320 million over the 4 years, or &pound;80  million per year.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That information came from an Assembly Research and  Library Service briefing paper, and it bears out the Department&rsquo;s response as  well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member has ignored the fact that, on top of the  cut in England,  there is a requirement for a &pound;20 billion efficiency saving for the Health  Service, which amounts to about 5% a year. We have not asked for those  efficiency savings to be found in the Health Service in Northern Ireland.  Indeed, we have given the Health Minister the ability, when he does make  savings, to retain those in his budget and move money around in order to give  him flexibility that is not afforded to many other Departments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  That does not change the fact that, on the baseline figures, the Minister has  not afforded the Health Department the same level of protection as the  Department of Health gets in England.  That will, of course, lead to problems in health. My colleague the Health  Minister made that point consistently. It will have knock-on effects. As other  Assembly colleagues have pointed out, the fact that health will take a hit  cannot be ignored.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There is genuinely a need for education here.  Perhaps when the Member discusses the figures with the Health Minister, he will  ask him about a &pound;330,000 report by Mr McKinsey that he commissioned. That  report, which the Minister has had for about eight months, indicates certain  things that could be done. If those things are not done, savings of &pound;5 million  a month will be lost. We have lost eight months of those savings. Indeed, the  Health Minister has made it clear that he does not intend to take any of those  actions. Those may be the kinds of things that could be done to try to make  savings in the Health Service. However, of course, if we have a Minister who  does not want to make unpopular decisions, we will never get to the point of  efficiency that we need to get to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Health Minister has never denied that efficiencies will always need to be  driven in a service the size of the Health Service. There will always be things  that have to be looked at and actions that have to be taken. The point is that  health cannot be skimped on, because need is rising constantly. Health  inflation is higher, so the pressures on the Health Service are always rising.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In just a second.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mrs Kelly pointed out, the Health Department is the only  Department that has reformed itself.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Every time an Ulster Unionist gets up and talks about the Budget, the speech is  about giving more money to the Health Department. Most departmental budgets  have had to take a hit. Will the Member tell us where he would make cuts to  give the money to the Health Service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have been trying to press the Finance Minister on the fact that, if the  Health Department enjoyed the same level of protection as the Department of  Health in England, the money would go to the Finance Minister through the  Barnett consequentials.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is absolutely outrageous for the party opposite  to try to say that we should have an NHS that is less fit for purpose in  Northern Ireland than it is in other parts of the United Kingdom? Would he care  to ask the Members opposite whether they are unionists?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  We know the answer: they are not. They do not want to fund the NHS at the same  level as in England through  what the coalition Government are giving to Northern Ireland. They do not buy  into the concept of a Health Service that actually addresses need. Some of the  most vulnerable people in our society will be the ones who suffer most.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for giving way. Given that he  avoided answering Mr McCann&rsquo;s question, maybe he will give us an answer to the  question now. Where does he expect the money for the Health Service to come  from? We allocated all the money in the Budget at present. Where will he take  the &pound;200 million a year from? Will he take it from education? Will he double  the rates? What will he do to get the money? Maybe he will also ask himself:  who has been in charge of the Health Service &mdash; which, in his colleague&rsquo;s words,  is &ldquo;not fit for purpose&rdquo; &mdash; for the past four years? Maybe that is where the  responsibility lies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  What my colleague was saying was that that is what it will become in the future  if we impose the Wilson  cuts that the Minister seems to want to make in health. He would have an &pound;80  million a year start if he gave us the same as the Department of Health in England gets.  We need to look at how to change the allocation and take more cross-cutting  measures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with some of the contributions that have been made  today. I agree with what my colleague Mr McCrea said last night about the need  to be much more outcome-focused. We have to look at how we can use our  resources and achieve outcomes for all our citizens through cross-cutting  agendas. Public health is not just a matter of health but can impact on DSD  around housing and even on how we plan our communities and how we live and  work. That is what we need to do to really drive a public health agenda forward.  In the time that our Minister has been in charge of the Health Department, he  has delivered on a public health agenda.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  It is rich of the Member to talk about the public health agenda given that his  Minister has spent 1&middot;6% of the entire health budget on it. That does not  indicate to me that he is serious about tackling it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  How much was being spent on the public health agenda before there was a Public  Health Agency? It is a start. It is vital work that has to be done. We must change  the mindset in order to address public health needs. The Health Service has  been reformed, and the public health agenda is something that we have to work  at.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: If the public health agenda is so important, and if  the Minister is paying so much attention to it and has sought, over the four  years, to make the Health Service fit for purpose as the Member describes,  maybe the Member can tell us this: what kind of a Health Minister spends 1&middot;6%  on the public health agenda and 1% on public art in new hospitals from his  capital budget? Is that getting the priorities right?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Finance Minister knows full well that the public health agenda is the way  forward. His colleague sitting behind him was talking about preventative  spending. Does the Finance Minister not agree with that? When the Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure was making a plea for more  money, the Finance Minister did not want that money spent anywhere near a  hospital or he would have supported some of what I have said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public health agenda is absolutely key to delivering  preventative spend in the Department of Education and to how we deliver better  services and outcomes for our citizens. Our preventative spend will have to be  greater. It will have to be better, and we will have to build up the public  health agenda and how we resource it. That is made very difficult when the  Health budget is being attacked.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  When are we going to hear the Health Minister&rsquo;s plans? That is what we want to  hear. When he comes on the airwaves and on the radio, it is all negativity.  What is that doing to the public? We want to hear plans. We want to hear the  Minister say that we are in a bad place, that we need to get out of that bad  place, and that he has a plan. I have not yet heard the Health Minister say  that he has a plan.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Member heard Dr Farry mention that the Health budget could be as much as &pound;1  billion short &mdash; it is hard to be positive when that is the case. The Member may  want to reflect on that when he keeps pressure on the budget and keeps denying  that there is a widening gap between Northern   Ireland and England. It is very hard to keep  positive when one cares passionately about the services that we need to deliver.  That will be the difference between my party and yours as we go into the  election.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member not think that it is a bit rich when Members here line up to  have a go? Let me ask them through you, Mr Deputy Speaker; where would they make  the cuts? With their expertise as Chairperson of the Committee or as Finance  Minister, where would they like to press the button? That is the debate that we  are not having. Members of the Assembly fire brickbats, but they have no  solutions. I have not heard as much tripe in my life as I did in the last  intervention. People talk about education; where is the debate on education?  Where is the debate on NEETs? The answer is that there is no debate in the  Chamber; all we have is some form of cack-handed deal between the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in that does not include the rest of us. They are not able to put forward an  argument that will stand up to public scrutiny, which is why they deal with  rhetoric and having a go at the individual &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Thank you &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind all Members that interventions should be short and  to the point. Mr McCallister has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and thank you to my colleague for that very  useful intervention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will see some of the ideas that the Finance  Minister spoke about last night regarding health issues. He questioned the  numbers of hospitals, doctors and nurses that we have. Those are very tough  decisions that he suggests we take. I want the health budget to be based on  outcomes and on the best outcome that we can deliver for our citizens. I am  concerned about the alarming number of as many as 3,000 or 4,000 job losses,  which the Minister highlighted to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague is absolutely right about the fact that we  need to look at everything: our public health agenda; the number of houses that  we build through DSD, given that barely 3,000 or 4,000 of them will be built  over this CSR period and given the debate about whether that will even be  possible with the money from housing associations; and how we build and grow  our economy and move away from our over-reliance on the public sector. The  Department for Employment and Learning will obviously be the cornerstone of  training delivery. The Bill will have a knock-on effect on the Department of  Education&rsquo;s problems with capital spend. The mismanagement of the Department of  Education means that the structures are in a mess. How is that going to be  handled?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Earlier on, the Member mentioned the most vulnerable in society. However, he  coalesced and agrees with a party that is cutting back on welfare reform to the  tune of &pound;600 million over the next four years. Surely that will directly hit  those who are most in need in society. His party supports the welfare reform  cuts and the Tories who brought in those cuts.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I do not know why that lot is saying, &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;, because it supports them as  well. We need to look at how welfare reform works. Thanks to the Labour Party,  the country is in a mess and is broke, because there is no more money. We have  to deal with reality.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask that Members return to the debate about the Budget  and do not stray from that any further.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am in enough trouble with the Deputy Speaker for allowing too many  interventions. I wanted to make only a brief contribution to this debate,  because I am quite anxious to get to other important business in the Assembly  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget needs to be reviewed. From listening to the  Minister&rsquo;s interventions during my contribution, it seems very much as though  the draft Budget is not a draft but a done deal between Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and  possibly the Alliance Party. However, no one else buying into it. We need to  look at and change certain things. The Programme for Government is certainly  one thing that should have been looked at and reviewed. We have been calling  for a review of that for the past number of years. It has become irrelevant  since it was first drafted. We need to look at how we can take a more  co-ordinated, cross-departmental approach to dealing with the problems that our  society faces. In the interests of getting to other business, I shall let other  Members have their say now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The Bill has the sole purpose of giving statutory effect to yesterday&rsquo;s Vote on  Account. Although the Bill relates only to part of the proposed expenditure in  year 1 of the Budget, it is part of what &mdash; I repeat &mdash; is a flawed process  around a flawed draft Budget. We remain strongly of the view that the Budget  needs to be improved substantially before it can be regarded as fit for  purpose. The Second Stage of any Bill is supposed to focus on the broad  principles of the Bill, so it is worth asking the question: what are the broad  principles behind the Budget Bill? Of course, the truth is that there are no  real principles driving the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague the SDLP finance spokesman, Declan O&rsquo;Loan,  has asked on numerous occasions, where is the vision, the strategy and the  Programme for Government that this Budget is supposed to be providing the  resources for? In a written answer from the Minister of Finance and Personnel  only a few days ago, I got an admission from him that perhaps there should have  been a Programme for Government. So, let us have some honesty around this debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Then again, the draft Budget meets some basic DUP  requirements. First, it meets the need to transpose the Treasury CSR settlement  into the Northern Ireland  context, thereby keeping DUP-led devolution on track, complete with nearly &pound;4  billion in cuts. Secondly, it leaves the two Ulster Unionist Ministries with  unreasonable settlements for health and further education. Although the  personalities and parties holding the various Ministries are due to change in a  few weeks, faced with the choice of doing the right thing or doing the wrong  thing while shafting their political opponents, the DUP, predictably, chose the  latter course.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So, how did the DUP sell &pound;4 billion in cuts to its partners  in Sinn F&eacute;in? How did it sell a mountain of misery for the least well off to  those self-pronounced champions of equality? How did the DUP get Sinn F&eacute;in to  swallow the prospect of doubling student fees, with the result that third-level  education becomes the preserve of the rich once again? Where is its equality  now? The answer is clear, as it always is: give Sinn F&eacute;in something for itself.  There it is in the social investment fund. It is a slush fund of &pound;80 million  that the DUP has gifted to Sinn F&eacute;in to buy its agreement to the DUP Budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not know what to do with that money, except that it intends to  give it to its friends. The DUP does not really care what Sinn F&eacute;in does with  the money; it was simply a price that it had to pay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every penny earmarked for that slush fund should be  reallocated to support legitimate programmes that will protect vulnerable  households and front line services while stimulating the economy with an  emphasis on job creation. That is the fundamental principle that should  underpin the draft Budget, the Budget Bill and all Budget processes. I repeat  yet again that this Budget should protect vulnerable households and front line  services while stimulating the economy, with an emphasis on jobs. No such  principles underpin this Budget. This Budget is the straight application of the  cuts from London,  which have been customised to give the DUP political advantage over its  opponents and to give Sinn F&eacute;in money for its friends.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of the latter, I wonder what, if anything, it  stands for these days. Sinn F&eacute;in abandoned the poor in the North &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I will give way in a few minutes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in abandoned the poor in the North and attacked the  wealth creators in the South. It is green Tories in the North and communist  reds in the South.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The principles behind the Budget should have included three  other principles, which I will repeat before I give way to the Minister. First,  rebalancing the economy between the public and private sector should have been  included. Secondly, there should have been a particular focus on job creation  in the construction and tourism sectors. Allied to that is a need to protect  the vulnerable through, for example, health provision and the new schools  estate. In that regard, there is a need to protect services rather than to  withdraw them, as is the case with the Downe  Hospital in Downpatrick and the new  schools for Down High   School in Downpatrick and St Louis&rsquo; Grammar School in Kilkeel.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There also needs to be a change of heart in the European  Commission towards the construction industry. I have already talked to the  Minister of Finance and Personnel about that where the aggregates industry is  concerned. If the exemption were reinstated, the construction industry, the  Quarry Products Association and all those associated with it would be able to  deliver better for the people on the ground. Thirdly, a genuine attempt to find  new sources of revenue and capital should have been included.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to give way to the Minister at this stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The leader of the SDLP seems to keep pumping the  idea that the Budget was somehow designed by the Executive or by the DUP and  Sinn F&eacute;in to give some advantage to those two parties over the other parties.  Let me just quote her words back to her: she said that the Budget was  &ldquo;customised&rdquo; to give the DUP benefit over its opponents. The two Ministers who  have experienced the biggest cuts and, therefore, have to take the hardest  decisions, are the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Minister of  the Environment. They are both DUP Ministers. The Ministers who have received  some of the greatest protection &mdash; the Health Minister and the Minister for  Employment and Learning &mdash; are Ulster Unionist Party Ministers. How, therefore,  does the Member reach the conclusion that the Budget is customised to give the  DUP advantage or benefit over its opponents?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his little bit of knowledge, but I still strongly  disagree with him. An evidence base proves that there is a deficit in the  health budget. The Chief Medical Officer has an evidence base &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  &mdash; as does the chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The Minister of Finance talks about the disproportionate hit that he expects  his colleagues to take. However, PricewaterhouseCoopers compiled a report on  behalf of NICVA. Figure 5 on page 8 of the report, in case the Minister would  like to refer to it before summing up, is titled: &ldquo;Real terms capital  investment outcomes of the Northern Ireland Departments in 2014-15 as % of  2010-11&rdquo;. It shows that there will be a 30% increase for DCAL, a 70% increase  for DFP and a 94% increase for OFMDFM. Those Departments are in the black; the  other Departments are in the red.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the case that this is a black-and-white game.  There has been funny money and a bit of creative accounting, so that Sammy  Wilson can get up in the Chamber and say what he thinks is convenient. However,  when one delves into the figures, there are plenty of little hidden funds for  his mates, too.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank my colleague for intervening with some very useful information, to  which I will add.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the DEL  budget. There is a clear intent to force people to increase or place a hike on  student fees, to which I am totally opposed. I voted on the matter in the House  of Commons, in the other place, too. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>It  is all very well for people to laugh, but they are party to having &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  No. I have given way enough on this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The information provided by Mr McDevitt is most  enlightening. A 30% increase in the DCAL budget, which would have helped the  construction industry &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The increase is in the DCAL capital budget, not the  DCAL budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I am sure that a significant proportion of that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Will the Member give way on that point?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  No. I have not finished my point. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  That all happened at the same time as the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure  &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Get your story straight. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Minister, no one should point across the Floor at another  Member. The Member who has the Floor indicated that she does not want to give  way. I ask the Member to proceed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Thank you for your forbearance on the matter, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is most interesting that the 30% increase in the DCAL  budget coincides with the Minister&rsquo;s decisions to withdraw funding from  important capital projects that would have brought important new infrastructure  to certain areas. I think particularly of the velodrome project promoted by  Down District Council, which would have increased physical and recreational  activity in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is time to get this Budget right. There is an onus of  responsibility on certain parties in the Chamber.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in have attacked the SDLP for trying to change and improve a  Budget that is not fit for purpose. However, we believe that that is not only  our right but our duty. I repeat that there is time yet to get the Budget  right. The documents that we produced and published before Christmas set out in  unprecedented detail &mdash; more so than those of any party in the history of this  place &mdash; what needs to change to make the Budget fit for purpose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We published our &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo;  document about 20 months ago. I was then a member of the Executive, and I  recall that the First Minister was particularly reflective on the SDLP Budget  plans at that stage and indicated that there were some that he favoured.  Interestingly, three of them, from my memory, were then adopted by the  Executive, so there was some favour among the DUP to our proposals at that  time. I have no doubt that it will look at our expanded proposals that were  produced in December with some insight. In summary, we call on the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in to make the necessary changes and produce a Budget that we can support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As Chairperson of the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure, I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in  the Second Stage of the Budget Bill. The take-note debate some weeks ago was  guillotined somewhat, and I did not have the opportunity to make the following  points.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure sustains the  second biggest cut &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for giving way. Does he find it a  bit contradictory that, last night, the SDLP Member for North Antrim Mr O&rsquo;Loan  complained about the size of the cut to the DCAL budget &mdash; I think that he gave  a figure of 17% when he intervened on the Chairman &mdash; and, now, this afternoon,  the leader of his party has complained that, as a result of the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in  carve-up of the Budget, DCAL&rsquo;s budget has been increased by 30%? Which of the  two has got it right? Maybe he could confirm that for us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am thankful to the  Minister of Finance and Personnel, Sammy Wilson; you might know him. Even more  alarming than the variation in the figures was the attempt by the SDLP to take  a further &pound;0&middot;7 million from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. The  party could not identify which programmes should be shelved and go to the wall  wilfully and willingly. There is a lot of inconsistency that needs to be  addressed in the SDLP group meetings. I do not have the privilege of being at  them, but I recommend that it deals with those inconsistencies, variations and  disparities at those meetings. That would be important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I made this point in the spring Supplementary Estimates  debate yesterday, and I make it again: DCAL accounts for 1% of total Executive  expenditure and sustains, proportionately, the second biggest cut, of &pound;14&middot;5  million. Public spending on culture, arts and leisure equates to the underspend  of other Departments. Other Administrations have not been so severe in respect  of their arts and culture budget, so, in a sense, the Executive appear to be  alone among Administrations in these islands in proposing such a severe  reduction to their arts and cultural budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The SDLP seems to get its figures wrong &mdash; its leader  thinks that the budget for DCAL went up by 30%, and the Member for North Antrim  thinks that it went down by 17% &mdash; but I want to make sure that the Chairman has  the figures right. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport in GB had its  budget reduced by 24%.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I agree with you. I was  going to leave out that figure because it did not suit me. That figure did not  suit my argument at all. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> It is an  excellent point that the Minister makes. I was going to do comparisons with Scotland and Wales  and conveniently leave out England,  whatever it is at. I was never a big supporter of England, so I was going to leave it  out of the equation altogether.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While reflecting efficiency and inflationary savings, Scotland and Wales managed to maintain  significant investment in the arts and &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Declan, keep her lit.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  appreciate the Member giving way, because I really want to make a point to the  Minister. I am surprised that, of all people, the Finance Minister has to be  corrected on such a simple point. Of the two percentages, one relates to  revenue and the other to capital expenditure. Both figures are absolutely  accurate. [Interruption.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members again that they should not shout from a  sedentary position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I was going to leave the  English figures out of the examples that I intended to quote. The Fianna  F&aacute;il-Green Party Administration in Dublin  face &mdash; indeed, they have since gone &mdash; the most severe economic crisis in a  generation. They applied a 5% reduction to arts funding. Scotland and Wales have largely managed to  maintain significant investment in the arts. Perhaps those examples are better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure is of the view  that any savings that come as a result of cuts to this area will make a  negligible difference to the overall Budget for the North but will have a  disproportionate effect on the creative industries, job creation, sport,  culture and tourism. The arts and creative industries make a contribution to  the economy, and the Arts Council is never slow to point out that every &pound;1  invested in the arts returns over &pound;3&middot;60 to the local economy. Nobody disputes  the fact that it is a significant net contributor, although the point is  regularly forgotten when the cake is sliced. However, the benefits of  investment in the arts are felt across society. For example, 56% of the money  allocated from the Arts Council&rsquo;s main grant programmes is invested in the most  deprived areas. However, those are the very areas that will feel the pain most  from cuts in the culture and arts budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The potential of the creative industries has been  recognised by government, and the Minister of Finance and Personnel understands  that, as do the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Therefore, the  Committee welcomes the draft allocation of a further &pound;4 million investment in  the creative industries. However, overall, the Committee regards the arts cuts  as disproportionate and retrograde.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The local film industry is flourishing and has great  potential. In December 2010, the contribution of NI Screen to the local  industry was acknowledged in the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s draft  Budget statement. The commitment to provide further investment through an allocation  of some &pound;5 million to the high-quality production facilities is definitely a  positive step. Recently, the Committee made a set visit to the Paint Hall,  where an HBO film, &lsquo;Game of Thrones&rsquo;, is being filmed. We were extremely  impressed by the hive of industry that was under way in that impressive  international production. As a result of that great opportunity, a wealth of  experience and expertise has accumulated in areas such as costume making, set  production, lighting and special effects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee strongly supports the development of the  local film industry and is, therefore, concerned that by 2014 NI Screen will  lose approximately 9&middot;4% from its current expenditure baseline, which in real  terms equates to a 15&middot;8% cut. That is a disproportionate cut to a relatively  small budget of just over &pound;1 million per annum. NI Screen informed the  Committee that wider Film Council funding in 2010-11 will mean that the overall  cuts will be severely front-loaded. The Committee is concerned about the  long-term damage that those cuts will have on the local film industry&rsquo;s  international reputation. Given the positive impact of major film productions  on our economy, the Committee calls for serious consideration to be given to  revising the proposed reductions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee heard how cuts will impact on front line  services and jobs in DCAL and its sponsored bodies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I listened carefully to the Member, and I am quite sympathetic to his view that  the cuts to the DCAL budget are such that, I presume, he finds them  unacceptable. If that is the case, will the Member vote against the Budget if  it is not amended and if it contains the same cuts and pressures that you  believe would damage the film industry, the arts etc in Northern Ireland? What  is the Member&rsquo;s position with regard to voting for the Budget in its final  form?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I was a corner-forward for  Carrickmore. That was my position on the football field. I will certainly vote  for the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: No, I have done enough,  Alban. It is a bit like a jack-in-the-box.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr A Maginness: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: On a point of order, Mr  Deputy Speaker. I have declined to give way to the Member a second time, but he  insists on asking. Will you intervene, Mr Deputy Speaker?<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I accept your plea for an intervention. It is quite clear that the  Member does not want to give way. Continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I will continue to make  important points, and libraries will be my next port of call, OK? The Committee  has always placed a great deal of importance on the role of the public library  service. With its emphasis on reading, literacy, learning, information,  heritage and culture, it contributes not only to specific DCAL PSA targets but  to the wider Programme for Government, including education, health and social  inclusion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a bit like a curate&rsquo;s egg here; there is good and bad  in the Budget, of course there is. The Committee welcomes the allocation of  capital funding to enable the replacement of the electronic libraries contract.  That is essential to libraries&rsquo; IT infrastructure, and failure to secure that  bid would have been very bad, so that news is good. The Committee acknowledges  that Libraries NI has delivered significant efficiencies since it was  established in 2009, which makes it a relatively young organisation. Libraries  NI will have to make cumulative efficiencies of &pound;13&middot;61 million in real terms.  Because of the efficiencies already made, Libraries NI warned that it has less  scope to make the required additional savings, which will impact adversely on  front line service provision and lead to the closure of more libraries.  Libraries NI has already closed 10 libraries. A further 10 are likely to close  under phase two of the libraries strategic review, which is out to  consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this point, on a constituency basis, I want to point up  the value and importance of a library in Fintona, County  Tyrone, which I believe that Libraries  NI should revisit, as it should a library in Draperstown, County Derry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  And in Killyleagh.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: OK, as well as other  libraries in the Moy and in Moneymore. Certainly, I am receiving lots of  lobbying from people on those libraries, and I know that the Minister  appreciates that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is extremely concerned that libraries  currently being considered for closure are located in small towns, including  Killyleagh, and so the securing of the proposed four mobile libraries is  essential and absolutely must be retained. Libraries have long been recognised  as neutral venues, and they play a key role in promoting equality, diversity,  social inclusion and a shared future. Often, ethnic minorities take advantage  of what are to them the absolutely essential facilities on offer in our local  libraries. The Committee urges that the next phase of the strategic review  takes account of the importance of maintaining neutral venues and prioritises  resources and services to enable libraries to continue to support that  important role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Museums are one of the Department&rsquo;s key spending areas. It  allocates around &pound;20 million a year to museums and, to date, has invested  substantially in key capital projects. However, National Museums has stated  that the real reduction in revenue of &pound;5 million over four years will have a  major impact of around 25% on staffing levels and affect opening hours, as well  as impacting negatively on its ability to operate as a strategic partner in  tourism and learning. The low level of capital allocation will mean that it  will not be able to proceed with much-needed investment programmes at the Ulster American  Folk Park  in Omagh, which is the county town of Tyrone, and at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During these hard times, we have to be innovative in our  approach and put our local cultural tourism assets to their best use. It is  clear that there is huge untapped potential for our museums to help to grow the  tourist industry, which could be a vital source of income for our economy going  forward. Therefore, we urge the Minister and the Executive to take a more  joined-up approach to supporting and resourcing cultural tourism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our Committee has placed great importance on participation  in physical activity and sport, as reflected in our most recent inquiry. We  came to the firm conclusion that the Executive should prioritise the need to  increase participation in sport and physical activity and provide the necessary  funding to implement Sport Matters, the strategy for sport and physical  recreation for 2009-2019, in this spending round. We are concerned, therefore,  that Sport NI&rsquo;s ability to implement the strategy will be severely hampered by  the shortfall of &pound;81 million. We welcome the draft Sport NI capital budget of  &pound;133 million, which will enable important projects such as the 50-metre pool  and regional stadium development to progress. That is good news for sport, and  the Committee acknowledges the long-term benefits that it will bring to the  development of sport in the region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expressed its support for DCAL&rsquo;s bid to  support the World Police and Fire Games, which is the largest of its kind in  the world. That major event represents an enormous opportunity to boost the  local economy and promote this region on a world stage, so we welcome the  proposed allocation in support of that bid. However, the Committee continues to  be concerned that the proposed reduction in the Sport NI budget will negatively  impact on the ability of people who live in socially deprived areas to pursue  sport and physical activity, which is key to improving health and well-being.  The Committee welcomes and supports the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to resolve the  funding issues of Special Olympics Ulster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to acknowledge the important role of the  North/South bodies. However, the Committee was not able to consider the budgets  for Waterways Ireland and the North/South language bodies, which have yet to be  agreed by both Ministers. The Committee looks forward to receiving more detail  arising from the budgetary processes for the bodies in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Committee calls for a full EQIA to be  undertaken on the DCAL draft budget for 2011-15 with the fear that closures in  the museum and library sector will impact negatively on elderly people, the  disabled and people who live in areas of high social deprivation and rural  isolation. That must be addressed as a priority.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak on the important Budget  debate. It is an important debate because people outside recognise the  financial circumstances that we are in. Most people have a working  understanding of the global context of finance, and they understand, as any  reasonable person will understand, that the House has to deal with a Budget  devolved to it from Westminster.  When a Budget devolved from Westminster  has &pound;4 billion less in it than we could have anticipated, it is only right and  proper that those outside who are in vulnerable situations, many of whom are  potentially facing pay freezes and some of whom are facing job cuts, expect us  to come to the House, work together and do our job. They do not expect us to  pretend that we can pick up pots of gold from some distant rainbow or that  there is more money in the Budget than there actually is. They expect us to deal  with the Budget that we have and to come to a consensus and work together under  a series of principles that will help people who face job losses and help to  promote a jobs-led economic recovery. We do not just want an economic recovery  but a jobs-led economic recovery. They want us to work together in implementing  the best Budget for the people of Northern   Ireland, a Budget capable of taking us out of a recession  that is more prolonged and deeper here than in many other regions of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Quite rightly, the Member said that we want to create jobs and move out of  recession, but, as I said to the House last night, the budget that Invest  Northern Ireland will receive as a result of cuts to the DETI budget will not  be adequate to deal with the new business that it needs to drive job creation  in Northern Ireland. If the Member is sincere about job creation, and I believe  that he is, he should be interrogating that budget and saying that it is  insufficient for that jobs-led recovery.</p>    
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  honourable Member for North Belfast makes a  valuable point, but it contradicts many of the points that were made from the  SDLP Benches earlier. According to the SDLP Member for South   Belfast, the DUP Finance Minister has protected his mates or his  Ministers. We now hear the more honest position of the honourable Member for North Belfast, contradicting totally the assertions that  were made moments ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn to the points about a jobs-led economic  recovery, but my point is that this is not the time to play politics with the  Budget. It is not the time to say that, in some way, we do not have to impose  the Budget, that we are all opposition politicians and that there is not really  a devolution settlement. Some people seem to think that we can hunt with the  hounds and run with the foxes and that we can do it all without any level of  economic reality. I venture to suggest to the SDLP that that is not being  semi-detached from the Executive; it is being semi-detached from reality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to some of the critical items that are included in  the Budget. A big issue has been made of the employment and learning budget.  Quite rightly, the First Minister said that he wanted to ensure that employment  and learning got a light touch. That is because, as the Member for North  Belfast Mr Maginness pointed out, a highly educated and highly skilled  workforce is key to taking us out of recession. The Department for Employment  and Learning got the second most generous, most favourable budget in tight  economic circumstances. The deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party started  to make some points about that, so I will address those quickly. The Department  got the second most generous allocation, and we now have to deal with the  Budget that we have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The leader of the SDLP talked about the doubling of student  fees. Let us look at the history. Hansard records that the SDLP Minister for  Employment and Learning had the opportunity and was asked by many Members to  look again at the &pound;3,000 student fees that were introduced then, which are now  &pound;3,290. The record, with which I will write to every SDLP Member, shows that.  That party states that it wishes to deal with student fees. The SDLP had the  opportunity to deal with student fees, and, at that time, it decided that  dealing with student fees would cost &pound;35 million, and the SDLP Minister refused  to revisit the issue of student fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, when the SDLP parrots its commitment to reducing  student fees, it is entirely honest for every Member to tell, as I will, every  parent they meet on the doorsteps that the reason that their children are  paying &pound;3,290 today is because the SDLP Minister refused to deal with the issue  of student fees and thereby imposed on a generation of students the economic  penury that that party is now trying to run away from. Tell the parents and the  students. Do not grandstand with them and shake their hands. Tell them the  truth: you had the opportunity to abolish student fees and you fluffed it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Ask them if they want to give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: Do  you want to give way? You had the opportunity to deal with student fees, but  you imposed them on students because the SDLP &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please address your remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  SDLP Minister said that he would not revisit the issue because it would cost  &pound;35 million to do so. Therefore, the SDLP is the party of student fees. You had  it within your gift to deal with student fees, but you did not deal with them,  so you should not pretend to students who have been billed &pound;3,000 for the past  however many years that you are the party that opposes student fees. Students  are intelligent enough to look at the Internet to see that the SDLP Minister  refused to deal with it. That is the answer that you will get when you knock on  people&rsquo;s doors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I went to university, I did not pay a fee. When I went  to university, I got a full grant, and I had no wish or desire to impose that  on anybody else. However, student fees are here today under devolution because  the SDLP would not revisit them because it said that it could not afford to  revisit them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  That is important, but, even more importantly, the SDLP argued at the time that  there was no evidence that student fees barred young people from lower-income  backgrounds from going to university. Indeed, in a press release John Dallat  said that:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">&ldquo;Even with the abolition of fees, we know from  evidence from the Republic that the percentage of people from lower  socio-economic families will not significantly rise with the removal of fees.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yet, today it is telling us that it is the champion of  those deprived people. A number of years ago, the party said that student fees  did not bar people from lower incomes from going to university.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does the Member accept that when Se&aacute;n Farren was Minister for Employment and  Learning he introduced the best support programme for students in any region of  the UK and that entry rates to further education from lower socio-economic  groups have maintained on account of that excellent support package?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  contend that it is part of the success of devolution that Northern Ireland has  achieved the 50% target of its 18- to 25-year-olds accessing further and higher  education, but it will not be lost on Members that the SDLP did not deny that it  had the opportunity to revisit student fees and that it billed students &pound;3,000  per head. That is the reality. The SDLP is the party of student fees, so do not  lecture the House on a Budget of student fees that you introduced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that you are sheepish about having to knock on doors  because you will be asked why, when the SDLP had the Ministry, you did not  revisit the issue when you had the opportunity to do so. A generation of  students is paying back fees that could have been avoided had the SDLP DEL Minister  made the choice. However, he did not; he balked at the challenge. Therefore, do  not lecture future generations about what you are doing about student fees when  you are the authors of the debt of thousands of students across Northern Ireland.  You left that out of your press releases. You are the authors of the debt of  thousands of students across Northern    Ireland, even though you had the opportunity  to revisit the issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It was the Labour Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: And  your sister party is?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please address all comments through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  SDLP is the sister party of the British Labour Party; I cannot see the  difference. You cannot hide behind the skirts of the British Labour Party.  Accept the fact that the SDLP&rsquo;s Se&aacute;n Farren, who was Minister for Employment  and Learning, was asked to revisit the issue but did not. As a result,  thousands of students are in debt because of the SDLP, which is trying to  reframe itself as the party against student fees. Student fees are here because  the SDLP authored and endorsed them by refusing to revisit the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From what I read last night of the SDLP&rsquo;s economics, that  party states that its proposals would bring back &pound;20 million. The fact is that  &pound;40 million is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to go on. I listened to the Member for South  Belfast Conall McDevitt go on vacuously for 90 minutes. In that entire time, I  did not hear how he would afford one single pound, shilling or pence of what he  suggested. We had a performance worthy of the Duracell bunny in vacuousness but  did not hear how he could afford one single penny of it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not want to go back to the SDLP&rsquo;s pamphlet on  economics. One would be better with a colouring book guide to finance. As every  single household in Northern    Ireland knows, a certain amount of money is  coming into the economy. We have to cut our cloth accordingly. We know how much  money is coming in. A lot of points have been made about the results of cuts  that the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and their sister parties, the  Ulster Unionists and the Alliance Party, have brought in. I know that Nick  Clegg is not overly popular, so the Alliance Party is trying to put a bit of  distance between them. However, the fact is that that package has left Northern  Ireland  &pound;4 billion short. People out there &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  will give way in a minute. People out there understand that if we are &pound;4  billion short, we have got to cut our cloth accordingly. By all means, campaign  for additional finance, but take the money that we have and cut our cloth  accordingly. The public understand that. People who potentially face losing  their job understand that. I have talked to my constituents in Strangford,  public servants on the front line, who have said, &ldquo;Jonathan, if it is the case  that we have to take a pay cut to keep other people in jobs, that is what we  want you to do.&rdquo; One lady, who is a senior social worker, told me that,  although she struggles to raise a family and run a home on a tight budget, if a  pay freeze has to be imposed to protect the economy, jobs and other front line  public servants from going on the dole, she wants that to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many who sit on the SDLP Benches are making a mistake. It  is the mistake of promising people that there is a new dawn or a pot of gold  elsewhere. The public have understood the &pound;4 billion cut. Now, they are telling  us to deal with it maturely.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  am surprised that the point has to be made again. However, since the Member has  repeated the error, I will make it. It is not necessary, inevitable or  essential that &pound;4 billion of cuts be simply handed out to the people of Northern Ireland,  with the consequent effects, particularly on the vulnerable. There is an  alternative. My party has produced detailed costings for all our proposals, and  those costings are in our document. If the Member wishes, I will place a copy  of the document in the Assembly Library for him to consult.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  appreciate that. However, I already have a copy. In fact, there is a one  sitting in front of me. The figures do not add up. Let me show you one way in  which your figures do not add up. You say that you will take &pound;7 million from  the Department of Justice budget, and all the rest of it. I will come to that  in a moment. That gives you just over &pound;20 million to play with. You need to  find &pound;40 million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member that he must make his remarks through the  Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, &pound;40 million is needed. The SDLP is on record as double-bluffing  students, as some people believe, by saying that it will ensure that their fees  do not rise any higher than it will put them up. That is a fact. The SDLP told  students that their fees would not rise any higher than it had set them in the  first place. Therefore, having told students that their fees would not rise any  higher than that, the SDLP needs to find &pound;40 million. In the savings plan that  it outlined last night, it came up with only &pound;20 million. Therefore, there is a  gaping black hole in the economy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker, for having to intervene again. I appreciate that  the Member is allowing me to make another intervention. However, he confuses  two totally different things. There are substantial saving and spending plans  in my party&rsquo;s documentation that would save more than the &pound;4 billion and divert  it towards protecting vulnerable people and stimulating the economy. His  reference to yesterday is to what was a technical amendment tabled to the Vote  on Account, which is a totally different and separate matter.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: The  reality is that you need &pound;40 million to keep your promises. In your document, I  have not seen where you are going to make the job cuts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Again, I ask the Member to address his remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  have not seen it stated in their document where they are going to make their  cuts, where they are going to cut the front line services to afford the foolish  promises that they have offered. It is simply not there. The maths do not add  up. I think that we are left with a double bluff, which is, in respect of the  Budget, let us pretend that the SDLP is in but is only half pregnant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Margaret Ritchie for getting it right. She  said that it is DUP-led devolution. The reality is that where the DUP is  leading, little Alex Attwood is following. He is as much in the Budget and as  much a part of the Budget as anyone else. He is voting for the Budget,  according to the ministerial code. However, he is hidden away. I did not see  him during last night&rsquo;s entire debate, and I have not seen him during this  debate of critical importance. I do not know where they have put him, but he is  not here. The SDLP is part of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the leader of the SDLP, as she sat beside  Declan O&rsquo;Loan. She made claims about Sinn F&eacute;in being capitalists here and  communists there.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  will give way in a moment. It was only a matter of months ago that Declan  O&rsquo;Loan, himself alone, wanted one single party with Sinn F&eacute;in. I know that  Margaret may have whipped him hard enough to bring him back into line, but it  was only a matter of months ago that Declan wanted one single party with the  communists and the capitalists.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Member giving way. I have listened carefully to what he has said.  In essence, he is saying that the Minister for Social Development, Alex  Attwood, is in some way supportive of the Budget and that he agreed to the  Budget. Let me make it plain: at the Executive meeting at which the draft  Budget was discussed and a vote taken, Alex Attwood indicated that he would not  be supporting the draft Budget, along with, I believe, the Ulster Unionist  Ministers. The only people who supported the draft Budget were the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in  and Alliance Party Ministers. That is a point to note. If there is any  implication that the Minister is detached from the SDLP view in some way, it is  wrong.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  do not wish to defend what was imposed on us. I think that your former leader  referred to it as the ugly scaffolding of the Good Friday Agreement. Part of  the ugly scaffolding of the Good Friday Agreement was the Executive and the  Executive&rsquo;s members. If the Member is looking for change, he will find many  willing listeners on this Bench. The ugly scaffolding that he imposed means  that the Executive act together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the SDLP has the courage of its convictions and is going  to leave the Executive, let it explain to the people of Northern Ireland how it  dropped the ball and ran away when the big decisions needed to be made, when  protection of the vulnerable needed to be most secure and when the promotion of  a jobs-led recovery in the Budget was most critical. Let it explain why it was  too afraid to make the big decisions. Having brought us to deficit with its  sister party, the British Labour Party, it was too afraid to make the big  decisions to get us into economic recovery. If you are not able to stand the  heat, you should not be in the Executive kitchen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning budget is going  to have to be carefully scrutinised for the benefit of many people. I want to  make a couple of points. I will leave off the SDLP; it has got too easy. I want  to turn to some of the major points. Let us turn to the education maintenance  allowance. It has been effectively scrapped in other parts of the United Kingdom,  and we will have to look at it. I welcome the Employment and Learning Minister&rsquo;s  commitment at Question Time today to look seriously at how we can protect the  education maintenance allowance. For many of my 21 years as a social worker,  many of my clients depended on the &pound;30 that they got from the education  maintenance allowance. Many of the families in the homes that I went into  across Strangford and North Down were totally dependent on their children  getting that &pound;30. That &pound;30 did not only contribute to their education. I pay  tribute to a generation of children that I worked with who took part of that  &pound;30 and gave it back into their households to help buy food for their families.  Literally one week of a delay from a technical college in getting the EMA meant  a week of economic crisis in those families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am strongly in favour of targeting the education  maintenance allowance. I have heard it said in England that people can afford to  do without it and that children there just use it for pocket money. That may  happen in very limited cases in England, but I can assure you that &mdash; based on the  evidence of working with real young people over 21 years &mdash; in the latter years,  when the EMA came in, it was the lifeline that kept those young people in  education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I appreciate the Member bringing up the issue of tuition fees and the EMA. Throughout  the debates yesterday and today, one of the key themes that I found kept coming  up was that some Ministers are working in isolation from the Executive. Does  the Member agree that it now seems that Ministers are working in isolation from  their own Departments? You can look at the stuff we have done in the Committee  on NEETs, and then look at one section of the Department promoting the issue of  NEETs and another part of the Department looking at the possibility of  targeting the EMA and taking it from those most vulnerable young people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  support the Member from West Belfast&rsquo;s contention that there is a crying need  for all of us in the House to get real with the amount of money that we have,  to be open and transparent on how we are going to deliver it and not to score  points off each other but, rather, come to a collective point of view. We have  come to a collective point of view on young people not in education, employment  or training. We have a report, which has been endorsed, and the question now  comes in the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than playing games and producing idiots&rsquo; guides to  economics, what we should really be doing is taking the money that we have now  and asking how we can protect those in the front line and the most vulnerable,  and ensure that we get a jobs-led economic recovery that will build our private  sector. Therein lies the means of garnering the resources to redistribute to  the young people &mdash; in this case &mdash; who are the most vulnerable. That is the task  that we have before us, and it is one on which we dare not fail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People should realise that, if education maintenance  allowance is toyed with, it will not only be toyed with at the educational  peril of the future of a generation of people for which it is the only means of  getting out of poverty and getting employment, but it will be toyed with at the  peril of their lives. I can bring you to many homes where I saw that &pound;30 going  straight back into the family home and not being wasted by the young people.  Please, take that plea.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to see the Budget coming back with what it can do  on the issue of student fees, not to play games with it or make false promises  on it. I would dearly love to give on what I had. In many ways I feel guilty.  As someone who went to university on a full grant, because my parents qualified  with their income and did not have any fees to pay, I bear a heavy  responsibility not to pull that drawbridge up behind me. My parents made  sacrifices. They both got their degrees later in life by distance learning, but  they did not come from university backgrounds. However, they ensured that their  three boys did, and they did so through a lot of hard work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that we, collectively, do not want to pull that  drawbridge up behind us. However, it is equally vital that our universities are  properly resourced. We are exporting some 25% to 30% of our young people to England, Scotland  and Wales.  Many times, they form relationships over there, build friendships and social  networks, find their first employment and buy their first houses, and in many  ways we lose them in what has become known as the brain drain. We have to  ensure that Queen&rsquo;s and the University   of Ulster are able to  compete on the international stage and that their teaching and learning is of  such quality that when young people have those degrees, they will be able to  stand the international marketplace for employment opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to turn to education. I believe that Northern Ireland still outperforms many other  parts of the United Kingdom.  I am a governor of Regent House, which outperforms not only the United Kingdom but also the Northern Ireland  average. Young people from working class backgrounds, many from my  constituency, through taking the AQA exam are accessing universities and  gaining opportunities that would have been unknown to them without the  education system in Northern    Ireland. So, it is not time to go for top  marks in terms of Karl Marx, it is time in the Budget to look at education from  a different angle &mdash; and that is not a different Engel, to mix my metaphors. It  is time to celebrate success and look at where we can invest in what we are  already doing that is outperforming.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that many Members want to speak, so let me raise  just a couple of other issues. One issue for Strangford, my constituency &mdash; and  it is critical in the Budget &mdash; is the service that the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of  Ulster provide. A small part of the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development budget is devoted to supporting and providing a lifeline to the  Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those clubs provide a service to many rurally isolated  young people aged 12 to 25. They provide the network, the education and the  training opportunities. Were they not there for my young people in Strangford,  there would be nothing else there for them. I make a strong appeal to the  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to look again to see whether that  &pound;75,000 can be put back into those clubs. We all know the pressures and social  isolation that many young people are experiencing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not play games with regional development, but in  many parts of my Strangford constituency public transport for employment is not  an easy option. They are rurally isolated and need the support that is out  there in the community, particularly as they go through those critical  adolescent years when physiologically the hormonal system in adolescence can  lead young people to become depressed, and the pressure on them to excel in  school is in many cases coupled with, as you know yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker,  a rural way of life that is becoming harder and harder to make money at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even with very hard work, many in the farming community are  struggling to make ends meet. Not that long ago it was the milk issue across  Strangford that literally had farmers working long hours to produce milk at a  value that was higher that what they could sell it for. However, they kept  going and, in certain cases, came out the other side.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is that many rural young people are going home to  farming homes and communities where the farm simply does not pay what it used  to. They have the pressures of adolescence and education, and many other  opportunities down the low country in my constituency for employment through  plumbing, joinery and bricklaying are equally going to the wall. It is not a  crisis situation. One thing that is critical in the Budget, and has been  critical for the past number of years in the Budget, is that where there are  opportunities to get construction contracts out, they should be put out. It is  not just the plumbers, joiners, roofers, bricklayers, architects and surveyors  &mdash; it is more than that. Right down parts of my constituency there are suppliers  who are dependent on the construction industry buying from them.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I was talking to one supplier who opens at  7.30 am to try to capture the market in my constituency. Another opens at 8.15  am to try to capture the market and get its supplies into the chain. I appeal  to the Finance Minister to continue the drive that the Executive have been  making. Where construction contracts can be got out, get them out, because the  residential private sector, for many people, has dried up.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many young skilled men and women are totally dependent on  getting employment in the construction sector. Many do not feel able to reskill  in something else. It is critical that those young people get an opportunity.  They are not looking for handouts; they are looking for a hand up. One in two  people in Northern Ireland  who are working on a construction job are working on a job that is funded by  the Executive. I appeal for pressure to continue be placed on that system so  that those opportunities continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development to look again at the situation of the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster.  During an economic recession, when many farming communities and families are  literally in a period of depression, those clubs provide a lifeline to the  young people of their communities and provide the social and emotional support  that will guide them and allow them to lead productive lives. I strongly  emphasise the need for the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs to have their funding brought  back.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many things that I could say. Many people from  Strangford have asked me to talk about the situation of the library in  Killyleagh. There is huge community support for the retention of that library.  Throughout all the difficult times, it provided an essential service. In many  ways, it was an oasis, because people did not need money to go there, anybody  could access it, and it provided a means to learning, entertainment and  relaxation in a village. I am not going to play games by saying that there is a  big pot of money and that we do not have to make cuts. However, I am asking for  the situation to be looked at again to see whether there is a means by which we  can keep our library service in Killyleagh. For many of the people who use it,  including the elderly and young people, going to neighbouring libraries from  Comber to Ballynahinch will not be a viable option. Please; there is a service  that is used, wanted and needed. If we are serious about telling people that we  want them to engage in lifelong learning, we have got to realise that many  people cannot do that without the services of a local library. I am appealing for  that situation to be carefully looked at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal again for a serious, coherent and consensual  approach to the Budget debate. By all means, people should argue their cases,  but they should not try to play fake opposition politics. Big claims were made.  Margaret Ritchie told us that if she got elected to Westminster, her party would stop the Tory  cuts. Well, she did not stop the Tory cuts; those cuts have come. She reminds  me very much of the story of the little boy with his finger in the dyke; she  thinks that if she stays put, the cuts will not come. However, the cuts have  come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must now ask ourselves what the most intelligent and  strategic approach is to deal with the money that we have been given. How can  we measure the Budget against the services that we need to provide? How can we  be realistic with the money that we have? By all means, people should argue  where they feel money should be shifted from. That is legitimate politics. What  is not legitimate politics is to argue x, y and z, but not specify the pounds,  shillings and pence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I turn to the issues of policing and justice, and  to a budget that was ring-fenced but, sadly, now needs &pound;200 million from the  reserve Treasury fund. I do not want to see a situation in which our police  officers are constantly having to prioritise their day-to-day policing role,  which all our communities so desperately want.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past number of weeks, some fantastic police work was  delivered on the ground. Last weekend, police in Newtownards came across a car and  a person under the influence driving it. They searched the car and found cash  and class A and class B drugs. They then searched two houses in Belfast and Ballywalter  that were connected with the car, where they found more cash and class A and  class B drugs, and they made an arrest. Our communities want that antisocial  behaviour dealt with. They also want the shame and scar that Northern Ireland  carries, that every 21 minutes of every day of every week of the year our  Police Service responds to an incident of domestic violence, to be dealt with.  The public want those issues to be properly tackled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we cannot ignore the fact that there are those out  there who, sadly, refuse to choose life over death, and who seem determined to  murder men and women who serve in the police. When Members of the SDLP talk  about taking &pound;7 million out of the justice budget, I cannot see where those  funds can come from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud to serve on the Policing Board. There are young  men and women in the police and one of those young girls, while strapping her  child into a child safety seat in the back of her vehicle, discovered a bomb  underneath it. She went back to work and dealt with it; she put the uniform on  and continued to serve all the people of Northern Ireland. That policewoman  was a young Catholic girl, and I salute her. She shows huge courage and bravery  in protecting me and my family in the face of people who would plant a car bomb  under a vehicle in which a child is about to be placed. However, she and other  officers do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are asking those men and women to go out and do what  must be one of the most difficult jobs in Northern Ireland today, I appeal  strongly for them to be provided with adequate resources and protection. I also  ask that we use whatever legal means are at our disposal to effectively deter  those who would, through death or injury, seek to divert or subvert a  democratic process, and ensure that they are unsuccessful. It is the first duty  of government and the first human right to protect life. We should provide  whatever resources are needed by the men and women of our Police Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us take a serious view of the draft Budget. Let us come  together, and, by all means, argue out our differences. However, let us not  play games and pretend that we are half pregnant. Let us take a consensual  approach and deliver something of value to those out there who look to us to  come up with a comprehensive response to their needs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I want to speak on the health  budget in particular, but, before I do, I want to draw on a point that Margaret  Ritchie made during her contribution. She referred to a slush fund that Sinn  F&eacute;in has been given by the DUP, which Sinn F&eacute;in would use for its &ldquo;friends&rdquo;. If  Margaret Ritchie means those &ldquo;friends&rdquo; to be those who are in need, she is  absolutely right, Sinn F&eacute;in will use the fund for that. However, given that  there are no criteria for such a fund and that we all know that it will only be  used in extreme and difficult circumstances, that shows the public the position  that the SDLP has adopted in supporting people in their daily lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget is a challenging one for the Health  Minister, as it is for all Ministers. However, those challenges must be met in  a constructive and innovative manner, in partnership with patients, health  professionals and trade union representatives. Unfortunately, that has not been  the approach from the current and apparently soon-to-be-gone Health Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has always supported and been on the record in  calling for the funding for front line health services to be maximised. We need  to meet the demands on the Health Service, but that must be considered alongside  the need to drive out the inefficiencies that we all know exist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the fact that we know that the inefficiencies  exist, the Minister has failed to publish any kind of savings delivery plan. As  I said in the take-note debate, one of the biggest challenges for the scrutiny  Committee has been the lack of detail, and we have been unable to get down to  the nitty-gritty of the whole health budget. The Minister irresponsibly threw  out figures, such as 4,000 job losses, which is a prime example of his flippant  attitude to date. That is not acceptable. Without those details, we are unable  to measure in real terms the implications of the Budget and the decisions taken  by the Minister. We have asked repeatedly for that information, but the  Department has not responded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps if I were to approach a particular radio programme,  the Minister would allow his newly politicised Chief Medical Officer to provide  the details on air. The Chief Medical Officer is, supposedly, independent and  here to provide advice to the entire Executive, which the Minister hailed when  he was on air. He then went on to refuse that Chief Medical Officer the  opportunity to speak to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister. There  is your independent Chief Medical Officer. That begs the question: what is the  Minister trying to hide? Why is he afraid to allow the Chief Medical Officer to  speak to the Executive? That is something that Michael McGimpsey needs to  address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to pick up on a few of the core issues that need to  be raised in the context of the Budget: efficiency; the public health agenda;  health promotion, or the lack of it; and the associated health inequalities  that are prevalent in society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many identified inefficiencies in the Health  Service, and I have listed them quite often in the Chamber. They include  consultant&rsquo;s bonuses amounting to &pound;57 million, and travel costs for senior  Health Service staff &mdash; when nurses cannot get a day off to attend a very  necessary one-day course. Where is the equality there? They also include the  RPA. John McCallister said earlier that the Health Minister was the only  Minister to deliver on RPA. That may well be the case, but we now have more  managers in the Health Service than we did prior to the RPA and, therefore, I  do not think that Mr McCallister should boast about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to look at the fact of those who do not attend  appointments. One of the biggest drains on the Health Service is the rate of  non-attendance at hospital appointments. We have some of the highest rates when  compared to England, Scotland and Wales or, indeed, the Twenty-six  Counties, but the Minister has failed to tackle that problem during his time in  office. It is a massive waste of the much-needed time of Health Service  professionals and much-needed resources. One of the biggest reasons why people  do not attend appointments is that they forget. A pilot scheme introduced in England texted  people, and that created massive savings for the Health Service. We need to  look at that and be more innovative. Those types of things need to be taken  forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to look at reducing hospitalisations. Studies  have shown that people are staying in hospital longer than necessary. That,  again, could save a massive amount of money for the Health Service. We all know  the argument around the cost of drugs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that a good place to start on efficiency savings would be  the Minister&rsquo;s and permanent secretary&rsquo;s hospitality bill, which is running at  &pound;22,000 for 2009?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Yes, &pound;22,000. All those small inefficiencies add up, and we need to drive them  all out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We spend &pound;60 more per head more on expensive drugs here  than in other areas. The Minister talks about how he will not be able to afford  to buy in specialist drugs, for example, anti-TNF drugs. John McCallister is  very aware of that because the Committee discussed the issue last week. It  stands to reason that if we keep spending more on general drugs, we will not  have enough money to buy in the specialist drugs. Again, that is something that  we need to look at further.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, we need to look at preventative  spending, which attracts 1&middot;6% of the entire health budget. I raised that when  John McCallister was speaking. I could write John McCallister&rsquo;s, or the UUP&rsquo;s,  answer to that. Along with more money, we need a shift in policy and attitude.  The whole focus is on acute issues, meeting targets and short-term gains. What  about the long-term health needs of the population? That is what we need to  look at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to look at preventative spending as an investment  for the future. If we are serious about challenging health inequalities by  investing in health promotion and raising awareness, we need to tackle the  reason why people get sick in the first place. That is why my party constantly  asks for a review of the Investing for Health strategy that has been sitting on  the shelves of the Department of Health for the past few years. We need to see  that published, and we need to see a cross-departmental approach &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. I agree with her on public health;  there is no divergence of opinion on that. The difficulty is in getting to a  stage where we can put that extra money into the public health agenda, because  the repayment for that is medium to longer term. However, I agree that it is  absolutely key to do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Yes, but we cannot keep looking at the Health Service purely as a sickness  service, as opposed to a Health Service. Short-term gains are fine but we need  balance, and a longer-term approach to the Health Service needs to be taken.  That is what has been missing. Sitting on the Investing for Health strategy or  shelving the document is not going to help anyone. We need to see the document  out there. We need to see cross-departmental working aimed at tackling health  inequalities across all the Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to give just one example of how we are failing to  tackle health inequalities, which is about the cost of tobacco-related  illnesses. The Health Service spends something in the region of &pound;230 million a  year on that, and smoking is by far the greatest cause of preventable death and  disease. It is killing five times more people than alcohol, illegal drugs and  road-traffic accidents combined. It kills something like seven people a day  right across the North and equates to 30% of all cancers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need a strategic approach to prevention, including  taxation, targeting the illicit trade, more public information and cessation  support programmes. We need more focus on and commitment to promoting good  health; not doing so is one of the biggest failings. Unless we seriously tackle  the attitude of the Health Department and make it look more towards health  promotion, we will constantly have to meet the rise in demands on the Health  Service. Nothing is being done to tackle that rising demand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is just one area of preventative spending. I gave that  one example, but there are many other areas that we need to look at, including  chronic diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, strokes and  diabetes. There are many, many areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn to the draft Budget and the Minister&rsquo;s position  on the capital Budget. The Minister said that there would be no funding of the  revenue streams for the projects at Desertcreat and Altnagelvin. That is just  playing games and is not a reality. We all know that the Belfast City   Hospital cannot cope and  that it is predicted to be at full capacity within the next few years. Where  are our cancer patients going to go? Altnagelvin is not a choice but a reality.  It is a necessity that needs to be taken forward. The Department of Justice has  set aside &pound;30 million for the Desertcreat project. Is the Minister going to sit  back and let that go to waste because he is playing politics with the issue?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear: Sinn F&eacute;in supports maximising the money  for the Health Service. It also wants to see publication of the North/South  feasibility study, which is another report that the Minister has kept on the  shelf for his own purely political reasons. Obviously, co-operation on a small  island like this makes sense.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am very pleased to, at last, get my chance to speak. I congratulate Paul  Givan for his short and sharp comments that all related to the draft Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, we are in the middle of the consultation  period, so there is a lack of a great deal of detail in the draft Budget.  However, that means that it is our chance to raise our concerns. Before I do  that, I will be a little bit holier-than-thou. We spent four hours last night  discussing the Budget, and we have probably spent four more today. Most of that  time has been filled with point-scoring and petty matters as each party gets  its own back. When I go round the doors talking to people, I am told that that  is what drives them away from politics. We have to change that and find a new  way forward. So, I ask all Members to try to find more constructive ways in  future of producing good, effective government here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to take the cuts that are coming on the chin. A  poll in January showed that 89% of business leaders said that the cuts will  improve the economy. It also showed that 75% wanted the deficit reduced  quickly, and we seem to forget that. Only 20% wanted a delay. We have got to  get on with it. We have got to, as Mr Bell said, talk to each other and find a  joint way forward to make everything work. We have to find the right balance  and work through consensus, and that means everyone working together. We need  an overview. We need all the Departments working together to try to get the  cuts and the balance that we are all looking for. We have got to grit our  teeth. Some of it will hurt, but, most importantly, we have to try to look  after the public and make sure that as few people as possible are hurt by the  cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I am going to touch on three matters. Given that no  other Member mentioned the environment, I will do so, and I will say a little  bit about construction and a little about my constituency. There is little  detail on any budget for the environment, and we need to know what the effects  of that will be on many of the ideas that have been put forward. I  congratulated the fact that &pound;4 million has been taken and moved to the green  new deal. However, we have to look again at the plastic bag levy or tax. A levy  on the number of plastic bags that we all use now would raise &pound;25 million and  would help us all, but it would not be right for the environment. So, plans are  being made on a guess. That guess is &pound;4 million, but it is based on some wrong  assumptions, because we are concentrating on the wrong type of bag. The  environmental lobby contends that we should be discouraging people from using  black bags and many other types of bag. It also damages the industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need the money from the plastic bag tax to sort out and  help finance river restoration. However, three Departments are involved in  looking after rivers. Perhaps we should be looking at the issue slightly  differently. The councils will be dealing with environmental noise. We have to  follow UK  and EU directives on marine resources. We also have to deal with minerals  mapping, fly-tipping and the repatriation of waste. We know that many EU  directives are coming at us, and, unless we are very careful, some of the cuts  will mean infraction procedures, which may mean large fines of hundreds of  thousands or millions of pounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that we have not looked at the effects of  some of the cuts. I would like to see more information so that we know that we  are not going to be hit by infraction procedures. We also know that there will  be cuts to the non-governmental officers, yet it is those people who bring in  three or five times more, as they look after the environment and take on the  onus of responsibility for implementing many of the EU directives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In planning, we know that receipts are down and that the  Minister of the Environment is doing his best to minimise layoffs. The Planning  Bill is coming through, with 17 lots of guidelines and other pieces of  legislation and the need for RPA to come with it, as well as 24 other matters,  the responsibilities for which will be transferred to councils. Yet there is no  talk of finance. We know that councils will need more resources, whether they  come from rates or grants from other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that cuts are planned for the strategic waste  infrastructure fund. Yet arc21, SWaMP and the North West Region Waste  Management Group are just about to buy their sites, subject to many other  matters. That will save a great deal of our money as we recycle and deal with  our waste properly in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to encourage alternative energy, but I have seen  nothing in the draft Budget on that other than the &pound;1&middot;5 million for the hydro  project at the Roe   Valley. The point is,  however, that the &pound;1&middot;5 million is spread over two years, but the project will  pay itself back in eight years. Funding for projects that repay themselves is  the sort of funding that we should be looking at. At the same time, the  Minister of the Environment is, quite rightly, upping his targets on landfill  and climate change. Yet, I cannot see in the draft Budget how he is going to  hit his higher figures, given that we are cutting back in so many of the same  fields. We need more detail about the effects of the draft Budget, and we need  to be able to look forward as best we can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to construction, about which I will be much  briefer. Some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the construction industry. We hear  similar statistics from every Department, but every &pound;1 spent in construction creates  &pound;2&middot;84. One of the key points that came out our meeting with the construction  industry is that the creation of more jobs in the construction industry means  more male workers, and we know that the notion of the male as the breadwinner  is slowly slipping. We need to create more jobs. We need to put more money into  construction where we can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another key point that came out of the meeting is that we  should engage independent assessors. That might be a lesson for every  Department, as everyone protects their own interests. We need independent  people who will come in and help each Department to cut properly and  effectively yet still produce the very best that we can. We need to look at  private finance and alternative ways of creating funding in the construction  industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to an absolutely key matter in my own  constituency. I met recently with 20 of the top businessmen in South Antrim,  all of whom had chosen to locate in South Antrim to be near the Belfast International  Airport and the motorway and to have  easy access to Belfast  and the two ports. However, we put very little money towards helping Belfast International  Airport, which is a key gateway, if  not the most important gateway, in Northern Ireland to operate at  maximum capacity. If we can put more money into the infrastructure that serves  that airport &mdash; whether through investing in roads or, perhaps in future, rail  links or even linking it with the M2 &mdash; that will bring more jobs. That is what  we should look at in the long term.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Would the Member care to comment on the news about increasing the number of  departure routes out of Belfast International Airport and how, if we are to  build an economy in this part of the world, it is essential that we have  excellent infrastructure and encourage as many airlines as possible to provide  flights to as many destinations as possible?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I welcome the Member&rsquo;s intervention and totally agree with what he said. We  need as many routes as possible, not only to Belfast  International Airport  but to Belfast City Airport.  As Paul Hollway of KPMG said, the money that we put into our infrastructure  and, particularly, into our key gateways is what will create more jobs and  bring us the wealth that should make Northern Ireland a great country in the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would love to touch on all sorts of other points.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s colleague Basil McCrea talked about airports, but we should not  forget the ports. Most countries are thriving by encouraging the cruise  industry. For example, 850,000 people came through the ports of Palma in cruise ships  last year. Efforts have been made here in that regard over the past couple of  years. Does the Member agree that our ports need to be invested in heavily to  ensure that people come in?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I agree entirely with putting money into the ports. However, our problem today  is about getting the balance of where, and how, we spend our money. I would  like to increase support for the young farmers; save Greystone Library, which  is vital to people in Antrim; and support the arts, which needs more funding.  Spending money on the arts, compared to spending money on health and other  areas, is a very hard argument to make. However, we must make sure that it is  part of the balance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I end, I will go back to where I was at the  beginning. We need everyone to work together. We need everyone to be  constructive. We need to work with a consensus to get the most effective Budget  that we can. Everyone intends to do that, but, in the Chamber, we tend to lose  our way as we score cheap points over each other. I want to get it across that  the public hate that. There may be a bit of fun and craic in some of it, but it  is what really switches everyone off politics.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I want to raise a number of points as a member of the Employment and Learning  Committee. I also want to raise some issues regarding vulnerable services,  particularly from the perspective of the community sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I asked the Minister for Employment and Learning a  question on the ApprenticeshipsNI programme. Clearly, that programme is under  threat from the draft Budget, which proposes to cut all funding to adult  apprenticeships and shift the costs to employers across Northern Ireland,  who are already struggling. If the recognised productivity gap in the local  economy is to be addressed and Northern Ireland plc is to be supported by  attracting foreign investment and maintain a competitive position in the global  economy, the enhancement of skill levels in the economy is essential. A reduction  in the budget is unavoidable. It will be put into effect by reducing the  support infrastructure associated with the current arrangements. The withdrawal  of funding for adult apprenticeships and encouraging employers to bear a  greater proportion of the costs associated with the delivery of the programme  will have consequences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to refer, in particular, to a local social economy  company in Derry that carries out training for  the apprenticeships. It is a company in my constituency that delivers the ApprenticeshipsNI  programme for adults, which, since 2007, has assisted more than 500 adults. It  has raised those people, academically, to NVQ level 2. It has helped people,  not just from my constituency but from across the north-west, in Strabane and  around Limavady, to achieve a recognised qualification relevant to their  employment. It came about after a serious loss of jobs in the north-west, when  Sir Reg Empey, in particular, came up with a plan to help to upskill workers  who found themselves unemployed. It also assisted employers whose staff needed  upskilling to maximise the strength and capacity of the workforce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The company has 300 people on the programme and a further  300 on the waiting list. People recognise the potential for upskilling, greater  opportunities and access to other forms of employment. I am sure that the  Minister will agree that the current economic climate will lead to increased  demand for education and training. The downturn in the economy provides the  opportunity for skill enhancement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The success rate here is 98%. I was surprised when I was  told that 98% of adult learners have achieved an NVQ. That is such a good model  of success to roll out that, surely, the Minister for Employment and Learning  should take it on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Chamber, we always talk about literacy and numeracy  problems across Northern    Ireland. However, here we have adults in  employment achieving skills in literacy and numeracy. The ApprenticeshipsNI  programme has facilitated local employers to undertake the training and upskilling  of staff, thus strengthening their business skill base and ensuring that jobs  are retained against competition. The all-age ApprenticeshipsNI programme will  continue to be promoted as the Department&rsquo;s flagship provision for professional  and technical training at NVQ levels 2 and 3.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Minister made it clear that we are still  talking about the priorities in the present Programme for Government. While  there is no new Programme for Government, it is important that any influence  that we can bring to bear must be on the economy and driven by the economy. We  must ensure that industry has the workforce that it requires and that that  workforce has the essential skills that it needs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There has been considerable criticism from the  Member&rsquo;s party about the absence of a new Programme for Government. However,  will he accept that, whether there is a current Programme for Government or a  new Programme for Government decided in the new mandate, the priority should be  the promotion, growth and rebalancing of the economy so that the impact of the  cuts on the public sector can be offset by increases in the private sector?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: He is going to tell the Member what line to take.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  He does not need to tell me which line to take. Carry on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will Mr Ramsey agree that, if we are to keep the economy at the heart of the  Programme for Government, we will have to do a darn sight better than we did in  this mandate? It was not the SDLP who saw the disconnect between the Programme  for Government and the economy; Professor Richard Barnett and the independent  review of economic policy found that, in fact, all the fine words on the  economy were not met by actions in the Programme for Government. Does Mr Ramsey  agree that, in the next mandate, we need not only to talk about putting the  economy at the heart of things but to actually do so?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  We need a Programme for Government that is synchronised with the Budget. It is  clear from what a number of Members said, including Danny Kinahan, that, when  we go canvassing round the doors, we hear people say that they want jobs for  their sons and daughters. So, the economy clearly has to be the priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak from my perspective as a member of the  Employment and Learning Committee. The Committee&rsquo;s major, substantive inquiry  into NEETs has to form the basis of the Programme for Government so that a  difference can be made to the 40,000 young people across Northern Ireland  who find themselves in NEET. Although I can concur with the Finance Minister  and my colleague behind me on that, it is obvious that we need a Programme for  Government that has to be reviewed and renewed so that different priorities can  be considered. Ensuring that nothing is taken away from the economy has to be  the number one priority. However, other areas have to be included in the  programme, such as services for children and those with learning disabilities,  which we must make a huge priority. How can DEL  justify cutting a successful Northern    Ireland apprenticeship programme that  provides the benefits that I outlined and that is, in its own words, a flagship  provision?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the First Minister accepts, the economy has to be the  number one priority, and we need to have &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  It is interesting that the Member is talking about apprentices. Just as I did,  he probably spoke to the people who were up here today. One of the ways that  apprenticeships can be addressed &mdash; I know that my colleague Jennifer McCann has  been promoting this &mdash; is to include social clauses in procurement contracts. If  we did that, we would start to get apprenticeships right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I cannot disagree with that. We have to make sure that young people, regardless  of their locality, have access to employment opportunities, especially in areas  where public contracts or whatever are being procured.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to go on to something else that is close to my  heart, and that is the University   of Ulster&rsquo;s Magee campus.  A number of Members made the point that almost 30% of students from Northern Ireland decide &mdash; it is their decision &mdash;  to go to England, Scotland or Wales to study. However, given the  way that things are going with increased fees, particularly in England and Wales,  it is clear that our young people are going to want the opportunity to access  academic courses across Northern    Ireland. We need to be up to providing that.  In the past number of years, the number of applications from young people in Northern Ireland  has increased. We cannot keep up with the demand from people who want to  continue their lifelong learning in Northern Ireland or to get their  degree here. I make that point because I know that the previous Minister for  Employment and Learning, Sir Reg Empey, provided a bit of investment under the  CSR for the MaSN cap to be increased so that more students could attend the  Magee campus in particular.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that the University   of Ulster has invested  &pound;18 million to expand its facilities. However, DEL has no capital moneys to assist that  expansion. We should make absolutely no mistake about it: that capital build  programme will provide huge economic regeneration and access to education for  future generations of young people. As the Finance Minister said, STEM subjects  in particular are key to the future needs of the Northern Ireland economy, and we  need young people coming through with good degrees in those subjects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that I am wandering off the subject somewhat, but  two schools in my constituency &mdash; Foyle and Londonderry College and Ebrington  Primary School &mdash; intend to relocate to a former Army base at Clooney in the  Waterside. However, we absolutely do not know what is going to happen in  capital build. It is important that money is found for those projects, which  will have a domino effect. We want to retain for learning purposes the huge  amount of land that Foyle and Londonderry   College currently holds,  particularly for the expansion of the Magee campus. That would accelerate all  the efforts that are being made. At present, we have the &lsquo;One City.  One Plan. One Voice&rsquo; agenda. For those reasons, all political parties in the  Foyle constituency, the business community, the community sector and the  educationalists are behind a single plan to ensure that we make the best of the  opportunity and go forward to ensure that we have the capital investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly mention student fees. I am a member of the  Committee for Employment and Learning, which is, I must say, a good, strong and  committed Committee that has forensically gone through a number of issues.  Originally, the Committee was concerned when Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s report on student  fees lay on civil servants&rsquo; desks for months and was not brought forward. At  that time, somebody in their wisdom decided to await the outcome of the Browne  report before bringing the Stuart report to the Chamber. In Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s  original report, there were circumstances in which she made it clear that she  did not see any justification for an increase in student fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no political appetite across all the parties  represented in the Chamber for student fees to be increased. We have seen what  happened in the past with student fees. We are now listening to students&rsquo; union  leaders, who clearly tell us that an increase in fees would place undue  pressures, burdens and future debts on young people. That is recognised by our  Finance Minister, who made similar comments in Westminster  about fee increases for students in England  and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to ensure that universities are not just a  playground for the rich. That is what senior academics across Northern Ireland  say, and most Members and parties would concur. Unfortunately, the brunt of the  DEL cuts is  directed at higher education. How can that be conducive to growing the local  economy and providing a well-qualified workforce? Over 80% of respondents to  the Department&rsquo;s 2009 Futuretrack survey found that student debts placed an  unreasonable burden on students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all listen to community groups and are lobbied to champion  their causes. Charitable groups and the voluntary sector are clearly expressing  concern about the Budget. Those groups say that the Budget fails to address  adequately the needs of the most vulnerable children and their families in Northern Ireland.  When those groups talk about the needs of families in Northern Ireland,  they are also talking about the needs of disabled people, whether that is  people with a physical or learning disability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A PricewaterhouseCoopers report undertaken for the Northern  Ireland Council for Voluntary Action identified that the Budget failed to  address comprehensively the needs of children as a group that cross-cuts many  Departments. The Budget takes a piecemeal approach that does not set the agenda  for our priorities for children and families and how we will fund those in the  future. That goes back to the point that was made during the intervention that  I took from the Finance Minister. If we are to meet the needs of our young  people who have difficulties, are vulnerable and under pressure or have  learning disabilities, that has to form part of the Programme for Government so  that we can prioritise those young people and ensure that funding is directed  in the most appropriate and effective way. Nowhere in the Budget is there a clear  focus on early intervention instead of crisis intervention, despite all the  evidence that that is the most effective and efficient way to fund and achieve  real change for youngsters right through from their early years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I made a point about the NEET strategy. I do not  see funding for that. There must be a cross-departmental programme of action.  It is not only for the Minister for Employment and Learning to ensure that  funding is in place to provide better opportunities for those same young people  but for most Ministers here, whether that be the Justice Minister, the Health  Minister or the Education Minister.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I made a point earlier in an intervention that I will make  again: we spend significantly less on early years provision in Northern Ireland than in Britain.  Children in Britain  have an opportunity but perhaps, even then, that is not enough in some areas. Britain spends &pound;2,000 a head on early years  provision, but, in Northern    Ireland, we spend just over &pound;600 a child.  That is not fair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we talk about equality, it must be about trying to  provide the best opportunity for children, and we have to make it real. That  should be in the Programme for Government; it should be a priority. I listen to  parents &mdash; particularly parents of children with special needs &mdash; whose children  did not have opportunities, whether that meant access to speech and language  therapy or other provisions that would assist them through their life. Their  children have grown up now, but those parents have become the big champions for  that cause. They want to ensure that other children have equal rights and  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Already, services for the most vulnerable children are  facing closure or reduction. The Children First service provides twice-monthly  respite for over 70 children in Cookstown and Magherafelt at a cost of &pound;70,000.  It is facing closure because the children&rsquo;s fund is ending. That is something  that the Finance Minister should take up. These are important services. They  provide a vital link to respite for parents who may be getting older and have  their own difficulties. There is clear evidence that the pressure and the  stress on carers can induce mental illness. They become anxious and depressed,  and that leaves a legacy in the healthcare that is required. That service is a  vital lifeline, particularly for families with children who have severe  learning disabilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are going to make a difference in people&rsquo;s lives, we  have to protect these core services. The children&rsquo;s fund has been very  effective over the past nine years in working with the most disadvantaged and  vulnerable children. The difficulty was that it was short-term funding  targeting long-term need, and removing the funding does not remove the need.  That is the important point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Across some of the vital Departments, the draft Budget  fails to prioritise and meet the needs of the most vulnerable children in our  society. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, we have to do that. We talk the greatest game when  we say what we want to do in providing for our children, but the evidence is  not there to prove that we are making a difference. We continually find  deficits in the postcode lottery across Northern Ireland whereby children  are not getting access to the most effective treatment at the right time. That  is a shame on us all. I am not one for being personal in a debate, but we are  here, and we entered politics because we wanted to make a difference. We wanted  to improve quality of life and we want to help people, but, at times, we all  get frustrated with a system that does not enable us to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by turning to infrastructure. Some Members  caused me concern today when mentioning the A5. They said we should minimise  the amount of money spent and section off some areas of the road, rather than  doing the full job. In my city, we are trying to maximise the most effective  way of access to the city of culture and to a city that is trying to make a bid  for world heritage status for its walls. It is vital that we have adequate  access.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have deficits, and one Member today referred to 30  years. We have been waiting longer than that for roads infrastructure into our  city. Even in the 1970s and 1980s in Northern Ireland, some roads  infrastructure was based on levels of car ownership, so areas of high  deprivation were never going to get the roads infrastructure. We are now living  with the legacy of direct rule, and, hopefully, we can make a difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I plead on behalf of the city and on behalf of &lsquo;One City,  One Plan, One Voice&rsquo;, which was mentioned earlier. We cannot let go. The Irish  Government have made it clear that they intend to invest in the A5 and A6. We  cannot let that go. We would fail future generations if we did not ensure that  access.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are several points that I have addressed directly to  the Finance Minister. I urge him to consider them. However, the responsibility  is not just on him. We have a collective responsibility and the Executive have  a collective responsibility to deliver the best that we can in the present  circumstances. We need to deliver for the people on the ground, the people who  deserve those services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The debate has been lengthy, and  it is questionable who, other than those who billeted in the Building, is  listening to it. The bad news for all the Members who spoke earlier is that the  news did not cover the debate; it did not appear anywhere. That is  disappointing in one sense because we, as politicians, and this political  institution often get criticised for not discussing bread-and-butter issues. No  issue is more of a bread-and-butter issue than the draft Budget and the  budgetary process. Perhaps some of the content was not worth broadcasting, but  that is for others to judge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken at a number of stages in the budgetary  process, including last night. We have to continually ask those who are most  vocal in their claims to oppose the draft Budget where the alternatives are.  There must be major concerns &mdash; 4 billion concerns &mdash; about the draft Budget. We  are starting on a completely unlevel playing field. I do not think that any of  the parties that worked to bring forward a draft Budget could say that this  draft Budget is their vision for the future of this society. The Budget has  been imposed on the people of the North by a party that did not receive a  mandate to do so. It has resulted in major cuts to services, as Pat Ramsey and  others outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a simple question for those who are most vocal in  advocating the rejection of the draft Budget: can they offer an alternative? If  they do, we, as a party, will examine that alternative carefully, and, if there  are beneficial proposals, I assure them that we will support them. However,  throughout the lengthy debates today and yesterday evening and during the hours  that have been spent on previous days on radio and television broadcasts, my  party and I have not seen alternative proposals being brought forward that  would alleviate the cuts to services as a result of the &pound;4 billion of cuts  imposed on this Administration by the Tory Government in Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  do not know how the Member can say that. I intervened earlier to draw our  document to the attention of a Member on the other side of the House. We have  produced substantial proposals that will address the &pound;4 billion deficit and  will find extra money to assist vulnerable households and stimulate the  economy. To say that there are no proposals on the table is simply not correct.  I ask the Member to look at them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  welcome the Member&rsquo;s intervention. As most of his party has done, the Member  has produced revenue-raising proposals. They were produced very late in the  day, but they were produced. We have been lambasted for eight or nine hours  about why we have adopted the draft strategy and why the document that the SDLP  produced was not part of those proposals. At other stages of the debate, we  have been told that the SDLP proposals are part of the draft Budget because all  the other parties stole its proposals in the first place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was interesting that Mr O&rsquo;Loan intervened because he was  at the forefront of the SDLP campaign in November and early December insisting  that a draft Budget be produced. It was a case of &ldquo;Any Budget. Give us a  Budget. We need a Budget&rdquo;. On 29 November, he said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Rather than causing extreme anxiety to community and  voluntary sector workers, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP need to address their funding  disagreements which are halting the adoption of a budget&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Who said that, John?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Mr O&rsquo;Loan. I am quoting from a document dated Monday 29 November. He also said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The two main parties need to get down to business,  start drawing up a budget and stop dithering.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, over the entire length of the debate, Members from  both parties have been challenged continually to put flesh on the bones of  where they would deliver cuts, but they have yet to come up with that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It is clearly much easier to talk from the platform of opposition than from the  platform of responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that the parties that are telling us to  ditch the draft Budget come up with an alternative. The alternative is not  simply to bring forward revenue-raising proposals, which we have all done.  Indeed, the draft Budget contains &pound;800 million worth of revenue-raising  proposals, and there is another &pound;800 million worth of proposals to be examined  over the four-year budgetary period. So, we have done that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has moved from &ldquo;Give us a Budget, any Budget&rdquo; to  &ldquo;Dump that Budget; it is not good enough&rdquo;. You need to produce an alternative  Budget. You need to produce a costed Budget &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Through the Chair, a LeasCheann Comhairle. You need to produce a costed Budget  that shows how services will be delivered to this society over the next four  years. If the SDLP can plug the &pound;4 billion gap, while protecting front line  services and investing for the vulnerable, we will support it in that venture.  However, to date, we have seen none of that. We have seen posturing, and we  have heard well-rehearsed speeches. Money from the SDLP has been well spent on  performance art, but we have not seen any alternative proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Sinn F&eacute;in, we are disappointed at having to deal with  the circumstances that we are in. Indeed, sharing in the anger of members of  the community and in that undoubtedly felt by other political parties in the  Chamber is perhaps an appropriate way to deal with things. However, anger and  disappointment alone will not solve the problems. We are in a new era of  politics and of political responsibility. Collectively, the parties represented  in the Chamber helped to bring society from conflict. The journey was long and  tortuous, but now there is a responsibility on those parties to help bring this  society back to some form of economic stability. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view is that that  will not be achieved in a Six   County settlement. Sinn  F&eacute;in strongly believes that the only way to achieve economic stability for the  people in the North and the South of this island is through a common economic  recovery plan. We believe that channelling resources through the North/South  Ministerial Council, which is governed by the Assembly and the D&aacute;il, is a way  to deliver that plan. The more the two economies on this island compete with  each other, the more they damage each other.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sudden rise of the Celtic tiger economy in the South  ended in it collapsing miserably around their feet. Although some in broader  political unionism took delight in that, many political leaders in unionism  took a sensible approach, realising that the collapse of that economy was of no  benefit to this economy. Indeed, the plight of the construction industry here  can be tied significantly to the collapse of the construction industry in the  Southern economy. Our exports and other revenue-raising mechanisms are affected  by the fact that the economy across the island is in dire straits.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The leader of the SDLP accused us of being opposed to the  wealth creators in the South. If she was referring to the leadership of the  Anglo Irish Bank, the corrupt banking system or the gombeenism of corrupt  politicians there, she was right; we were and will continue to be opposed to  them. However, lessons can be learned from that era, and we need to move  forward to create long-lasting and stable wealth for the people of this island.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have talked at length about the difficulties faced by  our society. In tracing back to where a lot of those difficulties come from &mdash; a  banking system that was allowed to go unfettered in creating a major black hole  in economies worldwide &mdash; we may find a source of funding that will assist our  society. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s proposals included placing a levy of &pound;25 million on each  of the four main banks. That would bring in &pound;100 million a year and &pound;400  million over four years, which would assist in easing our Budget deficit. We  look towards the credit union movement to create a &pound;100 million social fund to  assist the social economy and the creation of jobs in various sectors  throughout our society.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We look towards the green new deal, which the Finance  Minister has also reluctantly referred to as an area of expansion. We already  see progress being made on a plastic bags tax. There is progress, albeit  tentative, in relation to the ports. However, all that work and more is being  carried out through the Executive&rsquo;s Budget review subgroup, which is probably  the most important subgroup of the Executive at the minute. All the Executive  parties are invited to attend and to submit proposals. Although Executive  meetings are confidential, the SDLP talks about them freely in the Chamber. I  am not sure that it can be reported, but I am interested in knowing whether any  written, formal proposals that address the Budget proposals in detail have come  from parties such as the SDLP or the Ulster Unionist Party to the Executive  subgroup. If there are worthwhile proposals out there, I think that there is a  duty on all the parties around the Executive table to study proposals to bring  alternative revenue into our society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that, for the long-term economic stability of  this part of the island and the southern part, we need to move forward with a  new sense of direction and purpose. We must move forward not by working against  each other&rsquo;s economies but by working towards equal and mutual benefit for the  economies of this island for the benefit of the people. As I said in the debate  last night, we are not isolationists. We understand the socio-economic and  cultural links that many on this island have with Britain,  and the economic link with Britain  is vital. However, for centuries, that link has been based on the domination by  Britain  of this economy, and we believe that it should be based on co-operation for the  mutual benefit of this island&rsquo;s economies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As devolution has spread across Britain in the form of the Scottish  and Welsh Executives, an opportunity has arisen for a new relationship between  the different Administrations on these islands. Some may not be comfortable  with the use of the term &ldquo;Celtic nations&rdquo;, but the Welsh, the Scottish and our  own Executive have shown that when they work together for the mutual benefit of  their Administrations, their influence on Westminster  is stronger. That is an area of economic and other co-operation that our  Executive should exploit to drive forward an economic recovery plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will end on the point that there are 4 billion flaws in  the draft Budget. The draft Budget is certainly not Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s vision for the  future or one that the party is comfortable with. I doubt whether any of the  other parties involved in the discussions are comfortable with the Budget as it  is. The fact of the matter is that no one &mdash; no political party, no individual &mdash;  has come forward with an alternative draft Budget to be examined or debated.  Until they do, the posturing, shouting and dramatics are not worth anything.  They certainly will not assist the vulnerable in society. They will not help to  rejuvenate the economy or create business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All that that behaviour does is create airtime for those  parties. Therefore, unless an alternative comes forward, I believe that the  work that is going on in the Executive Budget review subgroup is the most vital  piece of work in the Assembly and the Executive at the minute, and I wish the  group well. If other parties have proposals, they should place them in front of  that group.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  The Green Party cannot support the Budget in its present form. There has not  been adequate time for public consultation, the Budget is not credible and it  lacks detail, and some departmental figures do not add up. It also includes  some extremely optimistic assumptions. I believe that it is merely an interim  Budget that cannot survive the next four years. In fact, I believe that it is a  temporary measure to get us through the election, after which many of the more  difficult issues will have to be revisited. It is clear that the Executive will  have to look again at their priorities and will be forced to make the difficult  decisions that they have avoided over the past four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review will undermine the Executive&rsquo;s claim that they  were providing stability and strategic vision by producing a four-year draft  Budget. I find it difficult to assess the draft Budget, as we do not have a  Programme for Government. The Executive have failed to produce one. That means that  there are no objectives, outcomes or targets against which the Budget can be  assessed. It makes very optimistic assumptions about assets sales based on an  unlikely uplift in the property market. It also includes ideas to raise funds  from the social housing sector and Belfast  harbour. That is rather speculative, may not be practical and may require  further legislation. There are too many questions about the draft Budget to  approve it without major changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to look at the context in which the draft Budget  was drawn up. It obviously has been dictated by the Tory cuts to the Northern Ireland  block. Although we accept the need to reduce public borrowing, the Government&rsquo;s  proposals are reckless, vindictive and ideologically motivated and will create  severe problems for the Northern    Ireland economy. The Government argue that  there is no alternative, but many economists, including a number of Tories,  suggest that the proposed cuts are in danger of driving us back into recession.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Tories claim that the cuts are fair and that everyone  must share the pain. That is clearly not the case, as the recent report from  the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) pointed out that the Budget is  regressive and will hit the poorest hardest, particularly those with children.  Like so many previous Tory Budgets, it is focused on cutting services to the  poor, the elderly and the vulnerable, and instead of imposing taxes on the  banks and financial institutions that caused the financial crisis, the Tories  have increased VAT, the burden of which falls heaviest on those on low incomes.  Similarly, the cuts in welfare, housing benefit, disability allowances and tax  credit will have the greatest impact on the most vulnerable. According to the  IFS, it is the most regressive Budget in generations. The fact that we in Northern Ireland  are more dependent on public services means that we will suffer disproportionately.  It is important that we do not follow Tory-imposed policies blindly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">George Osborne has claimed that the Budget has protected  poor families from cuts. The IFS disagrees, pointing out that the welfare cuts  mean that working families on low incomes, particularly those with children,  are the biggest losers. It will also have a dramatic effect on the regions in  the UK, such as Northern Ireland,  that are more dependent on public services. The policies have little to do with  the economic situation but are based on ideology and hostility to public  services. A cut to the Northern    Ireland block grant is based on that  ideology and totally ignores the impact that it will have on our economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget deficit has provided the Tories with an opportunity  to attack the public sector. They are committed to reducing public sector  services, and Osborne has admitted as much. The public sector is not an awful  waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money, which some Tories seem to believe, but is there to  provide a safety net and essential services for the young, elderly, disabled,  poor and most vulnerable members of our community. Unfortunately, in Northern Ireland, a high proportion of people  rely on public services, and we will be worse hit than other areas of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cuts set out in the comprehensive spending review are  easily the deepest and most sustained cuts to public expenditure since the  Second World War. The Budget was based on a number of assertions that the cuts  would help the economy to grow and that public sector cuts would lead to  private sector growth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reduction in public borrowing is dependent on economic  growth, but, to date, there is no evidence of that occurring. In fact, the  evidence is to the contrary. The most recent growth figures, which were  published in January, are appalling and fully justify my prediction last June  that the cuts would lead to a double-dip recession. That is likely to happen in  the next quarter, when the full cuts and tax increases come into operation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Government&rsquo;s policy is a perfect example of Tory  ideology taking precedence over common sense. It is like a medieval doctor  bleeding patients in the hope that they might recover, when, in practice, that  is more likely to kill the patients. The Tory strategy depends on economic  growth, while the policies that have been introduced effectively reduce demand  in the economy and cut growth. The figures raise even more questions about the  credibility of the Northern Ireland Budget. If the cuts cause the GB economy,  which was moving steadily out of recession, to return to negative growth, they  will clearly have a disastrous impact on our economy, which has not yet moved  out of recession.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we see the Budget in the context of  the present state of the Northern    Ireland economy, which is fragile and needs  tender nurturing. A recent Ulster Bank report indicated that, in the second  quarter of 2010, economic growth was 0&middot;4%. The projected growth for the whole  year was less than 1%. That indicates that the economic recovery is extremely  weak and must be treated with care. In addition, growth in the economy has been  limited to the service sector, and construction continues to decline. A major  factor in the growth in the retail sector has been the influx of shoppers from  the Republic to take advantage of the weak pound. However, there has been a  significant decline in the value of the euro, and, as a result, traffic from  the Republic is beginning to dry up. If that continues, as I believe it will,  we may be back into recession.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report showed that economic activity was extremely low  and that there was plenty of spare capacity in the economy. In the private  sector, the service sector is producing 11% below its 2007 peak. In addition,  manufacturing is down by 15% from its peak, and engineering is down by a third.  That is reflected in the level of unemployment, which rose for 27 consecutive  months. The rate of job losses has been much more severe here than in the rest  of the United Kingdom,  and the Ulster Bank suggests that unemployment will not peak until 2012.  Therefore, the economic climate in which we are presenting the Budget is one of  negative growth and increasing unemployment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The welfare reforms introduced by Westminster will have a further negative  effect on the local economy. Reform of the national welfare system is a major  issue for Northern Ireland,  because the local Executive have no control over national changes to benefits  or tax credits. As the local population is more dependent on welfare benefits  than in other UK  regions, the overall expected cuts of up to &pound;20 billion in welfare payments  will undoubtedly have a disproportionate effect on our economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern    Ireland economy is not capable of taking  further cuts at present. Although the cuts are necessary in the longer run,  they will have to be phased in. It is important that we get out of the  recession first. We are in extreme danger of ending up with a double-dip  recession. Tory economic policies are driven by the need to make immediate cuts  in public expenditure, regardless of the impact on public services and ignoring  the risk of a double-dip recession. Proportionately, Northern   Ireland has a much larger public sector than other parts  of the United Kingdom,  and that will, therefore, lead to disproportionate reductions in services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the previous Budget in 2007, the economic situation  in Northern Ireland  has been transformed totally. The economic climate has changed from boom to  gloom. During that period, decisions were made that, with hindsight, do not seem  to be priorities. The Assembly took a number of decisions, one example of which  is the freezing of the domestic rate. That has cost us &pound;50 million. The  introduction of free prescription charges cost &pound;15 million. The abolition of  industrial derating could have saved &pound;160 million. Free bus passes for the over  60s cost &pound;12 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All those things are desirable and, in a perfect society,  we could all support them. However, given the change in circumstances, we have  to review some of those decisions. We have a situation &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I was very interested and listened carefully  to what Mr Wilson said in relation to free prescriptions, free bus passes and  all the other issues that he outlined and said were very desirable in a perfect  society. Perhaps those were not his exact words, but that is what he was trying  to tell us. Since I suspect that most of us live our lives in an imperfect  society, I would be interested to hear him tell us whether he supports the  measures, or where he stands on the matter. Maybe he is coming to that point,  but I am interested to hear him deal with it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. The point that I am trying to make is  that we made those decisions before we got into the economic crisis. Perhaps we  would not make those same decisions now. We have an ongoing situation with  Northern Ireland Water, and we have deferred doing anything about it. We could  have saved over &pound;1 billion if we had cut out the subsidy for Northern Ireland  Water. Many of the decisions that have been taken by the Executive to date have  reduced the amount of money available for other services. The decision not to  impose water charges has meant that less funding is available for health and  education. Although a rates freeze is politically attractive, it is totally  unacceptable if it has to be paid for by a reduction in healthcare for the sick  and elderly. Many of those decisions will have to be revisited after the  election.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we look at the proposals in the Budget and the  departmental allocations, I am concerned about the cuts in education and the  impact that the reduction in the DEL  budget will have on the number of students who can attend higher education. I  am particularly concerned that there are no details regarding the level of  student fees and how that will impact on students, particularly those from poor  backgrounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the Minister acknowledging the potential  of the green new deal in the draft Budget, he appears to be using it as a  smokescreen for cuts to other green initiatives. The Minister has set aside &pound;4  million a year for green new deal initiatives. That is grossly inadequate, but  the Green Party welcomed it as a first step in the right direction. However, we  now learn that the &pound;4 million will be funded by cuts in other projects,  including some that have the potential to help to deliver some of the  objectives of the green new deal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, we were told that the green new deal would be funded  by revenue raised from the plastic bag tax, which we have advocated for many  years. Then DOE announced &pound;4 million of cuts to environmental enforcement  measures, which are helping Northern    Ireland to comply with EU directives. We  were told that that money would be allocated to the green new deal. Then the  Minister scrapped the rates relief scheme, which would have provided support  for people who wanted to insulate their houses. Again, we were told that that  money would be redirected to a green new deal fund.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Insulating houses is a priority in the green new deal, so  the Minister is simply giving with one hand and taking away handfuls with the  other. Investing in insulation would create jobs, help to tackle fuel poverty  and reduce carbon emissions. Some 400 people have taken advantage of the rates  relief scheme since it was introduced. The scheme appeared to be working and  delivering on the potential of the green new deal, so I cannot understand why  the Minister has chosen to scrap it. Very specific projects are to be scrapped  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will respond to the Member now because he does not  usually turn up at the end of debates. The rates relief scheme amounted to &pound;150  per household, but the cost of administering it was &pound;2,500 per household. I am  sure that the Member would think it much better to spend the money to deliver  services on the ground rather than on administration. Perhaps the Member could  bear that in mind. When the scheme ended, I made it quite clear why it had  ended: it was because administrative costs far outstripped payments to  households. I would rather direct money to energy-saving measures than to build  up a vast administrative structure in my Department. I would have thought that  the Member would welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I certainly welcome that explanation. However, no matter what new scheme is  introduced, it will still have administration costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Very specific measures have to be scrapped. There has been  the promise of a green new deal to appease the green lobby, which now includes  the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors,  environmental groups and trade unions, yet there are absolutely no details on  how that money is to be spent. The Minister has moved some money around and,  seemingly, removed some money entirely. It is not a green Budget. It will do  little to help Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s position as a leader in the new  green economy. Of course, the Minister has a record and has not been  particularly forthcoming in supporting green initiatives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members referred to the budget for Invest NI. It  causes me considerable concern because growing the economy and creating jobs  remains a priority, which, obviously, it should be. However, the reduction in  Invest NI&rsquo;s budget will mean that it will not have sufficient funds to support  the foreseeable number of new investment projects. We are at risk of missing  available job creation opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  seek some clarity. The Member sits with me on the Committee for the  Environment. We talked about the green new deal and supported funding of &pound;4  million for it. He wants more. In the next breath, he talks about creating  jobs, yet he sits on the Committee with me and knows that there is a  possibility that 300 jobs will go across the board in the Planning Service.  That will delay planning decisions and, therefore, economic growth. I want  clarification on exactly where the Member wants the money to go when he knows  that there is a possibility of job losses. If jobs are lost in the Planning  Service, that will create a backlog in planning decisions. He still looks for  money from the Budget for the green new deal. Will he clarify where a balance  can be struck? Does he support job losses or job retention?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  In no circumstances do I support job losses, particularly the loss of skilled jobs  in the Planning Service. Those people could be better deployed elsewhere. I  have no problem with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to refer to my main concern about the Budget  allocations. I find it particularly depressing that people now use the health  budget to score political points. Basically, the health budget is fundamental  to society&rsquo;s welfare. It should not be used as a political football. We should  listen to the concerns of the Chief Medical Officer. I have no political axe to  grind with anyone on the issue. I speak as an economist and as someone who has  had a long interest in health economics since I was first appointed to the  Eastern Health and Social Services Board in 1981 and sacked by Mrs Thatcher  four years later. My concerns about health spending began with the previous  Budget, when health received an increase of only 2&middot;6% while the NHS in England was  given an increase of 4% in real terms despite not having the same waiting list  problems that we had here. That 2&middot;6% increase was the lowest for many years and  compared badly with the average of around 8% over the previous five years of  direct rule.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The direct rule Ministers gave us 8% for the health budget,  and the devolved Government have given us 2&middot;6%. In practice, given the  demographic trends and the fact that NHS inflation is significantly higher than  basic inflation, the 2&middot;6% increase was, at best, a freeze in overall  expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 2007 Programme for Government included new programmes  to reduce the suicide rate, promote healthier ways of living, halt the rise in  obesity and implement the long-delayed Bamford report. However, the Budget did  not provide any additional resources to fund those programmes. The Appleby  report, which was based on need, looked at the standard of care in Northern Ireland compared with that in England, and it  identified a shortfall of &pound;500 million in health spending over the CSR period.  Therefore, not only would we have lower standards of care, but the gap between  entitlements and expectations in Northern Ireland  compared with those in England  would continue to widen. He concluded that access targets and waiting times  here would not match English levels in the foreseeable future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I voted against that Budget, I warned that it would  mean cuts in the National Health Service and lead to job losses and longer  waiting lists. That has come about, and it will be accelerated if we accept the  draft Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The differential in health expenditure between Northern Ireland and England has reduced significantly  in recent years. A recent study shows that, taking account of age profile and  deprivation levels, the Health Service in Northern   Ireland requires 10% more resources per head than England owing  to the higher levels of need. The differential in 2007 was 4%, and proposals  for 2008-09 totally eroded it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Efficiencies can clearly be made in the organisation and  delivery of the Health Service. I believe that there have been significant  improvements in recent years. There are, without doubt, opportunities to make  further savings, but they will not have a significant impact on overall health  spending. Fundamentally, the Health Service is underfunded, yet it is faced  with new demands daily, despite being unable to meet existing demands, such as  the implementation of the Bamford report. The fact that Bamford&rsquo;s  recommendations have not been implemented and mental health is still grossly  underfunded is a disgrace to any society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak about potential savings and alternative  forms of revenue raising. I agree with what Mr Beggs said about the dualling of  the A5. It should at least be downgraded. To spend &pound;675 million on such a road  cannot be justified, given its usage. The Green Party has opposed that scheme  since 2009, when we had a long and detailed discussion with environmentalists  and local landowners. The scheme is disproportionate, will destroy the natural  habitat and severely impact on agriculture in the area. Significant savings  could be made by downgrading that scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Savings could also be made on local government reform. I am  not clear about how much for that is in the Budget. I declare an interest as a  member of North Down Borough Council. For the past year, it has been clear that  the original drivers for the review of public administration cannot be  achieved. The main driver for reform was to be savings to the ratepayer. Those  savings cannot be guaranteed in the present economic state, so it would be  irresponsible to spend &pound;118 million that we do not have in the Budget to fund  the changes. However, I emphasise that it is essential that we review all our  priorities, policies and decisions that were made in the good times. There  should be no sacred cows.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to work within the block grant, we must revise  our priorities and consider alternative sources of funding. We should seek  additional powers to raise tax and, in particular, to introduce a local income  tax to replace domestic rates.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The current draft Budget highlights how little  control we have over our Budget, which is almost wholly determined by a formula  set by Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rates are one tax over which we have control, and the  Executive could consider a supermarket tax similar to that proposed by the  Scottish Government. That involves increasing the business rates on large  retailers with a rateable value of more than &pound;750,000. That would apply mainly  to supermarkets and out-of-town retail parks. As well as raising extra revenue,  it would support small traders and town centres. If it encouraged people to  shop locally, it would also be more environmentally friendly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The tax would help to rebalance the disadvantages faced by  small businesses as supermarkets take advantage of size and economies of scale  &mdash; an advantage beyond the reach of small businesses. An increase in tax on big  business reduces the strain on small business, levels the playing field and  promotes competition in the market. It would also compensate for the delay by  the Assembly in introducing PPS 5, which limits out-of-town shopping.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must revisit the options for funding  government services. They must review all options, particularly income-based  alternatives such as local income tax. That would clearly be fair, because it  is based on the ability to pay. It would also mean that non-taxed householders  contributed to funding. Other options include local sales tax, service tax,  land value tax and green taxes, which would help the environment as well as  raising revenue, based on the principle that the polluter pays.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party believes that the Assembly should acquire  tax-raising powers so that all increases in public expenditure are not met  solely from a property tax paid by the ratepayer but from a basket of taxes. We  must re-examine our priorities, reconsider our previous decisions and ensure  that scarce resources are allocated in the most efficient and effective manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Green Party believes that the Westminster  cuts agenda is ideologically driven, economically illiterate and will have a  disproportionate effect on the poorest in Northern   Ireland and the rest of the UK. We reject the Executive&rsquo;s  decision simply to implement the cuts, and we are particularly concerned about  the impact that they will have on health, education and the green new deal. The  Executive should consider alternatives to cutting vital local services, revise  the draft Budget to reduce those cuts by incorporating progressive ways to  raise revenue and ensure that the wealthiest pay more and the poorer pay less.  In the longer term, we should be looking at obtaining flexibility in our tax  system so that we are not solely dependent on the block grant determined by Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  You will be pleased to know, at this time of the evening, that I will cut my  remarks somewhat shorter than I had planned. I knew that the Finance Minister  would appreciate that. In fact, I had a discussion with him about it earlier,  and he promised that, if I did, he would give me some &pound;200 million &mdash; maybe &mdash;  for a project. Hopefully, he will stand by that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, who is not in his place now, said that  no party or Member had come up with an alternative Budget at this stage. He  must not be listening to what is happening in Committees and being said in the  Chamber, because people are putting forward various options and proposals.  Proposals come forward all the time in Committee meetings. A consultation  period is meant to be about options, proposals, and so on, and, as I understand  it, we are in the midst of such a consultation process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a question of priorities. At some stage, it may come  down to a town getting a new road or a new hospital. Those may be some of the difficult  decisions that have to be made. However, unless the Executive and the Assembly  develop and agree a proper Programme for Government with a proper overall  Budget, it will be difficult for them to progress. Had that work been done much  earlier, we would not have been here so long tonight debating the Budget Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a huge responsibility on the Executive, led  particularly by the First Minister, deputy First Minister and Finance Minister  at the Executive table, to bring forward those proposals to the rest of the  Executive members in a much more timely manner so that there can be much  broader agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Detail about the social investment fund and the social  protection fund is very limited. I look forward to getting much more detail on  those funds, just to hear of the areas where they may be spent and the criteria  that are needed to qualify for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The OFMDFM proposals suggested 3% efficiency savings for  some arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. I am concerned that there is not a much more in-depth  look at all quangos, arm&rsquo;s-length bodies and commissioners to establish whether  we can cut out a number of them totally without just making efficiency savings.  A number of them are not much use to the Province. At least a third, if not more,  of those bodies could be easily taken out of commission. That would see  significant savings for the Assembly and Executive, and the money could be  utilised in much better ways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was also very disappointing that the Barroso task force  did not produce what the Executive and Assembly hoped it would produce and  develop. If we had had much better outcomes from that, we would have had a much  better Budget outcome as well, because clearly those are the areas where we  need the investment. We did not accomplish any of that as far as I am aware.  There were very high hopes for that, which did not materialise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are a few of my initial thoughts at this stage of the  evening.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Chomhairle. At this part of the evening, most  people will be obtaining brevity &mdash; from me, anyway &mdash; rather than adding to the  length of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The focus of what I am about to say is derived mostly from  my capacity as Deputy Chairperson of the Environment Committee and as a member  of the Committee. There are concerns that, as a consequence of the Budget, the  Department of the Environment is anticipating a reduction of 150 staff, in  addition to a previous reduction of 150 staff which departmental officials  indicated would be achieved through redeployment or secondment to other jobs in  the wider public sector, early retirement, routine retirement and resignation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They and many others are very concerned that there could be  further jobs losses and that the Department does not have an adequate handle on  its budgets. A clear example of that came during a presentation by departmental  officials to the Committee when they introduced projections for a plastic bag  levy. A proposed levy on single-use plastic bags was to be introduced by the  Department of the Environment and used by the Department for environmental  projects. We saw estimates for a possible &pound;4 million raised by that levy for  which there is no legislation in place. On three consecutive occasions during a  projected and prepared presentation to the Committee on a private Member&rsquo;s  Bill, the Department was not ready to have its officials attend and elaborate  on the Bill with regard to that levy. So: no legislation as yet, no projected  &pound;4 million raised, no environmental programmes and no other funds identified to  support those programmes. We have a budgeting process at the Department around  legislation that is not in place and which may not be in place, and that there  will be projected cuts of &pound;4 million for key environmental projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is &lsquo;Alice  in Wonderland&rsquo; budgeting with money that is not there and is not likely to be  there in the lifetime of this Assembly. You often wonder to yourself why that  was ever put into a consultation document on the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Further concerns have been raised around the impact of  funding on non-governmental organisations. It is extremely important that we  refer to those organisations, because, quite often at less cost than their  public sector colleagues, they provide a valuable service in biodiversity and  in protecting the environment. They have an overview of what the Department of  the Environment is doing and work alongside it to protect our environment and,  indeed, our biodiversity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the other part of the Department, which is to do  with planning. We need to have more efficient planning decisions. I have read  some of the preparatory briefing documents that were provided to us by the  Quarry Products Association, which feels, and rightly so, that the introduction  of further costs through planning fees, including additional costs to the  applicant for an environmental impact assessment, will not raise more money for  the Department. That should not be seen as a money-making exercise, because it  will inhibit and act as a handbrake on the progression of planning applications  through the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to see more investment projects getting started,  and we need to see the green new deal being pursued to create low-carbon  buildings and to stimulate the local economy. That is where the stimulus will  come from. Those of us who have been out and about in the constituencies  liaising and consulting with, and working on behalf of, small businesses know  where the real growth of the economy will start and where the shoots of that  growth will be; among the small and medium-sized enterprises. The indigenous  and locally based enterprises need our encouragement, they need our support and  they need our investment with the limited budgets that we have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  The Member sits on the Environment Committee with me. Does he agree that we need  to retain as many jobs as possible in the Planning Service to ensure that the  planning applications are processed and that the economy grows?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I entirely accept the Chairperson&rsquo;s point. The Chairperson has been a strong  advocate of us getting a model on how that operation will function. Local  government will want to see the outworkings of that model. The Chairperson is  correct to point out that we want to see a more efficient Planning Service to  deliver on planning applications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to make sure that business is supported and  facilitated to help re-establish employment in our constituencies. I speak as a  representative of Mid Ulster &mdash; some other representatives from the constituency  are in the Chamber &mdash; where the construction sector has been badly brutalised as  a result of what has happened to world economies and, as a consequence, our  local economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that some key capital projects in the Mid Ulster  constituency are going ahead, such as the policing college, which is eventually  taking shape. I want to place on record my thanks to those Ministers who have  facilitated that project, because, not only does it advance policing for the  region but it brings about key investment and more jobs and support services.  It is important that that acknowledgement is placed on the record. We want to  see that project moving as quickly as possible towards fruition to have good  policing in the region and to support our local economy and jobs, especially  those in the construction sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all those Ministers who were helpful in advancing  the project, but I have to say that the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety has not been particularly forthcoming in helping to see the  project progress. That has been obvious from a series of Assembly questions  that have I put to the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Minister of  Justice and from other meetings that have taken place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be glad to hear, at this time of the evening,  that I am bringing my remarks to a conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Thank you, Minister. I need to put down a few markers for my conclusions on the  draft Budget.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP feels that the draft Budget has no plan for  rebalancing the economy or for economic development, and it needs a rethink in  that regard. It will also potentially place over 9,000 public sector jobs at  risk. Thousands of vulnerable people will also face benefit cuts by 2012. I  realise that a good part of that is driven from Westminster,  and I pay tribute to my colleague Alex Attwood for the work that he has done  with Westminster  to try to alleviate the worst excesses of those benefit cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget also creates the potential for hospital  closures and new medicines and medical facilities, such as the cancer unit at  the Altnagelvin Hospital, being unavailable to patients.  There is no robust strategy for job creation, but I realise that, in a very  supportive role, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment was  particularly helpful with a number of individual projects in the Mid Ulster  constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There could conceivably be less independent scrutiny of  government. I refer specifically to the reduced funding for the Northern  Ireland Audit Office, and the consequential effect that that may have the  Public Accounts Committee. The draft Budget will also see a massive drop in the  building of social housing, potential construction job losses and 100 schools  will go without repairs or new buildings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of that, coupled with the potential introduction of  student fees at &pound;5,750 a year and the scrapping of the education maintenance  allowance, does not augur well for our future. Much more creative thinking is  required on those issues, and that is why the SDLP put forward its concerns  about the draft Budget and highlighted some of the thematic areas that must  feed into it. Thank you, Mr Speaker and the Minister also.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very important topic. The reality  of the economic situation in which this country finds itself is stark. The cuts  in public spending will be deep and enduring, and, as was outlined earlier, the  potential for a double-dip recession is very real.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a very real chance that young people in Northern  Ireland, of say 20 years of age, may not hold their first proper job until they  are at least 30, and that is based on the opportunities that are available for  young people at present. Women in Northern Ireland will quite  possibly work in lower paid positions in the public sector, and there is a very  real chance that they will face redundancy in the four years that are covered  by the draft Budget. Children who are born in this Budget cycle will have less  access to resources in health and education to support and enhance their  lifetime opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Budget will reduce living standards and increase  poverty in Northern Ireland.  No sector of our society will be untouched, and we will all feel the impact.  This is a time for very dedicated, creative and strategic thinking and  planning, yet there is little evidence of any such approach in the draft  Budget. The economic strategy and proposals for job creation that will be  critical to minimise the impact of the draft Budget are unfinished. There is a  rhetorical commitment to invest in and support a robust local economy and to  identify new funding streams, but how that will be achieved has not been fully  worked out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Revenue streams appear in some departmental spending plans,  almost out of nowhere. There is talk of a reduction in corporation tax, but no  clear explanation of how that will unequivocally lead to job creation. Indeed,  that seems to be the recurring theme for the draft Budget, with rhetorical  commitments to key goals or objectives and insufficient evidence or detailed  consideration of how they will be achieved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A more disturbing example is the apparent failure by  Departments to truly consider the impact that the draft Budget will have on the  most vulnerable, although that is not in the gift of the Minister of Finance  and Personnel. Although there has been an extensive verbal commitment to  protect those who are most at risk in a very tight Budget cycle, there is very  little financial commitment to make it happen in the detail of the draft  Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From what I can see from the draft Budget and the  departmental spending plans, section 75 obligations have largely been  approached as a box-ticking exercise, rather than the critical analysis of the  impact that Executive decisions have on those in our society who are already at  a disadvantage in accessing opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, I have been lobbying the Executive for several  months to introduce children&rsquo;s budgeting into their processes so that we can  have a clearer idea of just how much those spending and savings plans will  impact on the life chances and opportunities of our children and young people.  Unfortunately, that analysis has not been conducted by the Executive, although  I note that the issue of children&rsquo;s budgeting is on the agenda of the next  ministerial subcommittee meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What we can see on the surface is sufficiently  disconcerting. Families with children are already under strain from the real  costs of inflation and increased VAT, and, in addition, they will bear a good  portion of the impact of the proposed tax and benefit changes. That was  outlined earlier by Mr Brian Wilson when he referred to the report by the  Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reductions in the health and education budgets will further  diminish the services and supports available for this generation of children  and young people. Thousands of families are further impacted by the lack of a  meaningful investment in early years. We know that the dearth of affordable  quality childcare in Northern    Ireland is one of the main barriers to  parents &mdash; primarily women &mdash; accessing the job market. At a time when the real  value of wages is declining, redundancies are increasing and benefits are  disappearing, there is absolutely no excuse for the Executive&rsquo;s inability to  address the issue and remove that barrier from women&rsquo;s lives. Women will  increasingly need access to the job market and greater flexibility than current  childcare provision offers so that they can access any form of employment  available to them at any time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our commitment to our children is further weakened by the  anaemic draft child poverty strategy. Despite a legislative obligation to end  child poverty by 2020, the strategy applies so many conditions to meet those  obligations that it is, essentially, meaningless. The core belief of the  strategy appears to be that child poverty can be addressed only in boom  economic times, which is both misguided and inaccurate. There are no signs of a  commitment to the child poverty strategy in the draft Budget. There is no clear  indication of funding for the minimal initiatives that it proposes and no means  by which to measure progress or gauge whether we are lifting children out of  poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another thing that troubles me about the draft Budget is  that there are no clear indications that Departments have worked together to  create the Budget, nor are there any signs that it is connected to the other  strategies that the Executive have produced over their lifetime. Where is the  cohesion, sharing and integration strategy in the draft Budget? Where is the  child poverty strategy? Where is the commitment to end fuel poverty? Where are  the elusive childcare and racial equality strategies, and where is the  Programme for Government? The absence of that critical document strongly  suggests that, rather than being a Budget based on strategic planning and  thinking, the Budget is little more than a series of numbers that have gone  through a negotiation process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are facing historic economic times. Most of us have not  faced this level of economic contraction in our lifetime. This is not the time  for an &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be Alright on the Night&rsquo; approach to budgeting. It will require  incredible dedication and creativity to deal with those circumstances. It will  also require some very real co-operation between Ministers in the Executive and  a commitment to getting the Budget right right now, instead of going through  the motions simply because there is an election on the horizon. That  creativity, co-operation and commitment were all there when the banks needed  assistance &mdash; the very banks that played a major role in creating these economic  circumstances. Now, through this Budget, ordinary people are starting to pay  the bill for the big bank bailout. They need that same level of creativity, co-operation  and commitment, and they are expecting us to deliver it for them. I urge the  Executive, who have repeatedly made a rhetorical commitment to protect the most  vulnerable in our society, to ensure that there is actual money behind that  commitment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the economy contracts and welfare support disappears,  the categories of individuals who fit the description of vulnerable are  expanding. It will be absolutely critical for all Departments to work together  to ensure that we get maximum impact from increasingly rare resources.  Revenue-raising must be creative and progressive. It is clear that those living  on limited means will face the highest percentage loss of real income under the  Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They will have much less to give. Fees, increases in  charges or rates must be fair, with the better off paying more, relative to  income. More than finding new sources of income, this Budget must be about  managing wisely what we have. We could do much better. For example, I would  like to see genuine co-operation among Departments in the commissioning of  services, particularly in planning and delivering programmes for children and  young people, to ensure that support systems and services for our children and  young people remain as robust as possible and that there is minimal duplication  and waste. A statutory duty &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Does she accept that, since the demise of the  children&rsquo;s fund and the Executive programme for children, there has been little  evidence that such cross-departmental working and commissioning has been  happening? It needs to happen so that all Departments recognise the benefits  that come from early investment in preventative activity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention; he is absolutely right. He was in favour  of a statutory duty to co-operate among Departments when they are commissioning  and delivering services, as that would cut down on duplication and ensure that  services are delivered in a way that maximises the outcome for children and  young people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I will pick up on the theme expanded on by  Mr Beggs. Many community and voluntary organisations are paying the price of  the withdrawal of the children&rsquo;s fund from the Office of the First Minister and  the deputy First Minister. That is having severe repercussions on community and  voluntary organisations, those dealing with children and on other community and  voluntary organisations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention; he is absolutely right. I am aware that  the children&rsquo;s fund was scrapped because there was a pile of money left in it  that was not accessed. However, we should have cross-departmental funds for  which Departments can bid when there are cross-cutting themes, such as issues  that concern children and young people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, at Question Time yesterday I raised the issue  of Home-Start with the Health Minister. Home-Start provides much-needed  services on a volunteer basis; it can look after three families for &pound;1,000 a  year; and it helps children who are at risk of coming into contact with social  services or of going into care. Home-Start scheme volunteers work with families  and children to keep them out of care. The sums that they save the public  purse, in the longer term, are critical. That is why such schemes should be  funded and a cross-departmental fund for children and young people looked at  again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge all Departments to source and fund programmes based  on outcomes. John McCallister talked about that earlier. Departments should not  axe a service in a budget line item in order to come up with the right figures.  Like other MLAs, I have watched as funding for small, relatively inexpensive  programmes with very high impact disappear while funding for larger, more  questionable, programming is preserved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Preventative spending, which was touched upon by other  Members, will be key over the life of this Budget. Many of the programmes now  facing closure offer incredible value for money by preventing expensive health  and social security crises later. I strongly urge Ministers to look at the real  outcomes of the projects and programmes that they support and to work together  to ensure that they are not blindly chopping off organisations&rsquo; funding and  thus damaging their ability to function and deliver services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the upside is that the economic crisis will force  us to look seriously at the financial cost of division and the duplication of  services and at the financial consequences of not directing sufficient  resources towards community relations. Economic growth and job creation will be  critical over the next few years. That cannot happen without serious investment  in a shared future. Without a real and resourced cohesion, sharing and  integration (CSI) strategy to tackle the divisions in our society and a clear  understanding of the role that poverty plays in feeding and sustaining those  divisions, we will not be able to attract the outside investment that we would  like.    </p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">We will not achieve and maintain the stability that is  required to embed and expand economic growth and, ultimately, to shift  resources away from the very expensive results of sectarianism &mdash; in policing,  housing, justice and other large cost-agency responses &mdash; towards sustaining  prevention and equality of opportunity. Continuing division makes investment  difficult and drives the best and most successful and talented members of our  communities away.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">8.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I encourage the Executive to think through genuinely what  they are offering the people of Northern    Ireland. What kind of society is really on  offer through this draft Budget? What prospects for employment and economic  recovery are here? What do we really expect to happen to those on whom welfare  reform will impact?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am acutely aware of the fact that is  has been a long 24 hours for very many of us, but I am not going to promise  brevity if I cannot be sure of delivering it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To me, it seems as though the draft Budget is really about  lost opportunities. What is being proposed now, without allowing the public  proper involvement in forming and shaping a new Budget for the next four years,  is a lost opportunity. What the Assembly and the Executive have failed to do,  over the past couple of years in particular, represents another lost  opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will know, I have been a member of the Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety since the end of November 2010.  The Committee has looked at the draft Budget in a number of respects.  Yesterday, my colleague Tommy Gallagher read into the record a number of SDLP  proposals on how we think the health budget in particular could be better tested  and probed. However, I do not think that anyone in the Chamber should vote  lightly for a Budget about which such serious and grave concerns have been  raised over its potential impact were it to go ahead unamended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to share with the House some quotations from John  Compton, the head of the Health and Social Care Board for the North and the  senior official in the Health Service here. On 13 January 2011, he told the  Health Committee:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As currently presented, the draft Budget means that  we will be short of &pound;200 million in cash a number of weeks after it is  confirmed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to say:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On 1 April 2011, we would need to be able to spend  &pound;200 million less cash, and that is what makes the situation so critical.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The officials from the Health and Social Care Board  pointed out that 70% of the Health Service&rsquo;s budget is spent on people&rsquo;s wages  and various other costs. Unless a lot of people are to be sacked on 1 April,  those costs will still be there. Therefore, we are left to deal with services  or charges. Those are the options that were put on the table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The potential impacts on services were outlined to the  Committee. The number of jobs that could be lost has been widely reported. We  were told that new and better drugs for patients that would be available in England would  not be available here, even though they were approved by the National Institute  for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) under clinical excellence guidelines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were told that there could be rationalisation of  community care packages and domiciliary care. We were given the example of  someone who is entitled to 15 hours of domiciliary care a week perhaps having  to wait two months to get any domiciliary care, which, if it is provided, will  be for five hours rather than 15 hours. We were told that there could be longer  waiting times. Despite the progress that has been made in reducing them,  waiting times, not just for particular specialist procedures but across the  whole range of surgical and other medical interventions, would shoot up from  nine-week and 13-week targets to 52 weeks for various everyday medical  procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were told that there would be a significant impact on  health and social care funding for the voluntary sector. We all know from our  own experience the vital role that, from a cost-effectiveness and long-term,  wise investment perspective, the voluntary and community sectors play in the  Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps most stark of all &mdash; to me, at any rate &mdash; is the  prospect of unplanned, short-notice closures of medical facilities. We were  given the example of how a hospital ward or A&amp;E department could close at  as little as one hour&rsquo;s notice because there would not be medical staff on hand  to provide a safe service if there were no proper provision for locum or other  emergency staff when the regular staff are sick or otherwise unavailable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone who is contemplating voting for the draft Budget  unamended, or even only mildly amended, should do so only having given very  serious consideration to the frightening potential impacts on health and social  care here that have been outlined to us for the next four years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the most important issue facing people in the  north-west is anticipation and waiting regarding the radiotherapy unit? We know  the consequences, and we have heard briefings. The Speaker and all the Members  from Derry visited the City Hospital last week to see the provision and  facilities there for people across Northern Ireland. We know now that  10% of people in Derry who have cancer have to  travel there three or four times a week for four or five minutes of  radiotherapy. The distress and travel times involved are an absolute disgrace.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member agree that no games should be played with  this important subject and no question marks should be placed over it? The  costs of the radiotherapy unit should be absolutely inescapable. It will  provide not only for the city of Derry  but for the north-west. Some 1,000 people from our area who currently travel to  Belfast will  receive the service at Altnagelvin. Some 350 people from Donegal will get the  service at Altnagelvin. I appeal to the Finance Minister &mdash; through the Member &mdash;  to use his influence on Executive colleagues. It is an absolute disgrace and a  crying shame that we cannot go ahead with the unit despite having the capital  investment &mdash; 50% being paid by the Irish Government &mdash; with 30% of the revenue  being paid by the Irish Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I concur wholeheartedly with the Member&rsquo;s remarks. I am on record expressing  similar sentiments in the House. A further point is the absolutely essential  nature of the radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin, not only for the future  treatment and care of people in and from the north-west of the country but for  people across the whole of the north of the island. If treatment is not  available in Altnagelvin, those people will still have to travel to Belfast. However, we are  told that there simply will not be sufficient capacity in Belfast. Therefore, everyone in Northern Ireland  who suffers from cancer over the next number of decades will be affected. That  point should be strongly received by everyone in the House. I will come back to  it towards the end when I talk about issues that concern the north-west  specifically.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with some of the wider issues relating to the  draft Budget. On a number of occasions during today&rsquo;s debate, we heard about  whether the SDLP provided various figures or any ideas. Unfortunately, Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd is not here at present. However, if I hear that again, I can threaten only  to read into the record the April 2009 &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo; or  our &lsquo;Partnership and Economic Recovery&rsquo; documents, both of which are publicly  available. I was disappointed, but not entirely surprised, to hear that some  Members had not read those. All of us should take an interest in ideas that  other parties put out on an issue as important as the future of our country and  our Budget over the next number of years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I said at the start that this is about lost opportunities.  To some degree, we have lost two years by trundling along with a substandard  Budget that was no longer fit for purpose and was designed at a time when  economic prospects in the North, around these islands, in Europe and globally  were very different to what we have experienced since the recession bit  families and businesses very hard. Various SDLP Members mentioned different  measures from those SDLP papers, particularly from the earlier publication  because it has been in circulation for such a long time, that have not been pursued.  I need hardly rehearse them, but certain issues that were not mentioned in the  debate are worth mentioning. Why do we have junior Ministers who cost taxpayers  a lot of money but seem to deliver few outcomes? Why do we need such a bloated  Executive Information Service? Why have we not imposed a pay cut on senior  civil servants of 5%, as the SDLP suggested, or a comparable figure? Why do  senior civil servants benefit from free car parking in Belfast? That runs against good economic and  environmental principles, and we are supposed to be trying to get people out of  cars and on to public transport, bikes and other sustainable means of  transport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have published a raft of ideas that could be taken on  board. Why does the public sector still own car parks that are prized assets? I  accept that there is some impact from disposing of capital assets in a  depressed property market. However, where there are ongoing business concerns  in public hands, with a practically guaranteed revenue stream, now would be a good  time to release receipts from those, because investors are seeking that type of  investment. The money raised could be put into other projects and programmes  that are stuck for cash.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Odyssey complex is a major entity in Belfast. I am sure that all Members, even the  less trendy ones, are aware of its existence, as it has been there for quite  some time. We talk about probing and testing the draft Budget and every  potential source of revenue, and I would like to refer to the Odyssey Trust  Company Ltd accounts from 2009. The company, as I understand it, is a charity  that exists to serve the public interest. It was set up with the transfer of  significant value in public landholdings. At the time, the value was certainly  into the millions of pounds and possibly even into the double-digit millions of  pounds. In many ways, it seems to have been left to deal with its own affairs  since the transfer of those assets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2009, it spent more than &pound;500,000 on 12 members of  staff. We could take an average, but what is really interesting is that, in  2008, three of those staff earned between &pound;70,000 and &pound;80,000. A year later,  however, one member of staff earned between &pound;80,000 and &pound;90,000, a further  member of staff earned between &pound;90,000 and &pound;100,000, and a third member of  staff earned between &pound;110,000 and &pound;120,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time as those salaries were reported, the  charity said that its cash-at-bank total was &pound;38,130,695. I can break that  figure down further. Just over &pound;11&middot;5 million was in unrestricted funds to meet  the ongoing needs of the charity. Have we tested the potential for recouping  that sort of money? The amounts held against actual and contingent future  leasing costs of the property were more than &pound;22 million. That type of  potential revenue needs to be probed and tested because, in comparison with  some of the other pressures on the draft Budget, these are not insignificant  funds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I and my party colleagues want to know whether, if there is  money there, we will test it and go after it. When only &pound;20 million can be made  available for a hardship fund, &mdash; hardship, as a result of welfare cuts, will  affect the most impoverished and vulnerable people in society &mdash; we must ensure  that money that would help those vulnerable people is not lying in a bank doing  nothing for society.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">8.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not far from the Odyssey lies Belfast harbour. Yesterday and today, there  was some discussion about the harbour and about a proposal, which was mooted in  our aforementioned document from April 2009, to yield value from it. The  Minister of Finance and Personnel seems to be a bit more open now about  pursuing moneys from the harbour. However, in 2009, his party colleague Edwin  Poots, the current Environment Minister, responded to our call in &lsquo;New  Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo; to go after some money held by the Belfast  Harbour Commissioners for wider public benefit by saying:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Given that the Port of Belfast  is a key part of our infrastructure, it would not be wise to prevent its  progress by taking resources away from it.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Official Report, Bound Volume 40, p336,  col 2].</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Last night, the Finance Minister said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Under the existing rules, projects may attract money  from the Harbour Commissioners. If that is not possible, we have two years to  change the law.&rdquo; &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Official Report, Vol 61, No 3, p295, col 1].</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Finance Minister now seems to have bought into  the fact that it is a good idea. So, if it is a good idea today, why did the  Minister of the Environment not realise that it was a good idea two years ago?  Of course, there could be a disagreement between him and the current Finance  Minister. Maybe the Finance Minister can tell us whether he has discussed that  with his party colleague, the Minister of the Environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a further lost opportunity in that the  Finance Minister is now talking about writing in two years to this Budget  process if there is a legislative requirement to change the statute to take  money from the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. The obvious point is that if that  decision had been taken when we first mooted it 22 months ago, we would be only  two months away from being able to yield that money. So, unfortunately, that is  another lost opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Mr Farry of the Alliance Party talked about the  potential for North/South co-operation, and he hit on very many useful points.  There is massive potential for mutually beneficial co-operation between those  two parts of the island without any hindrance or hurt to anybody&rsquo;s political  ideology, national identity or any other consideration. Of course, many of the  things that are discussed in the House are cross-border projects. The A5 and  the A8, for example, are cross-border projects instigated during direct rule,  and the radiotherapy centre at Altnagelvin is a cross-border capital project,  and they are all beneficial to those on either side of the border. However,  they are just the start of what is possible. There could be much more shared  procurement, many more shared services and, particularly in areas such as  health, very many more shared specialisms as we try to secure and develop  world-class expertise on the island.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A scoping study was done on the potential for further  collaboration and co-operation in health and social care between North and  South, but, unfortunately, we are still awaiting the publication of that document.  As far as I know, it has not even been discussed at the Executive. However,  Ministers may correct me on that if I am wrong.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr Callaghan for giving way. On the point about the North/South  feasibility study on health services, will the Minister, in his summing up,  confirm to the House whether he has had sight of that document? It makes 37  recommendations on efficiencies in procurement, service planning, capital  planning and treatment services on a cross-border basis, particularly in the  border counties but also between the two major cities of Dublin  and Belfast.  Will the Minister confirm whether he has had sight of that and whether he  thinks that it takes a common sense approach that is in line with the  conversations that he had recently with the current Minister of Finance in the  Republic of Ireland, Brian Lenihan, and those that I am sure he will wish to  have with the next such Minister?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. It seems that telepathy is one of his  attributes, because that is precisely the request that I was going to put to  the Finance Minister. I will certainly look forward to hearing his response in  his conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given what I have already articulated about the A5 and the  A8, it almost goes without saying that transport, in its broadest sense, is an  area in which there could be much better co-operation, not just through joint  services but through joint procurement, the sharing of expertise and experience  on both sides of the border, and various other things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The business community is also hungry for further  co-operation between the two Administrations. That community sees a lot of  duplication and red tape for companies and sole traders doing business on both  parts of the island, particularly, though not exclusively, those along the  border corridor. From my constituency experience, I know that that is a  particular issue for many family firms in the north-west and, I am sure, other  parts of the border corridor. For example, such people may have two or three  shops or small manufacturing facilities, one on either side of the border, and  they face various difficulties in dealing with two different systems and  whatnot. It is true that some of that cannot be dealt with by this Assembly.  However, many of those issues can be dealt with, and that is something that we  could usefully try to address somewhat better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People in Derry and the  surrounding areas are keen to further our subregional issues. I am particularly  mindful of the north-west gateway initiative. It certainly seems to me and my  party that a north-west gateway fund, with money contributed by the Dublin  Administration and the Belfast Administration, would be a very useful way of  addressing some of the particular issues that are faced by that part of the  country. Unfortunately, this Budget is strong on one thing: reinforcing the  silo mentality that has continually failed our constituencies and communities  right across the region. A north-west gateway fund would be one way of  addressing that. As Mr Beggs mentioned on a number of occasions today, there  are other areas in which cross-cutting funds would be very helpful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The children&rsquo;s fund was a very productive and precise way  of dealing with many of the issues that affect children and young people across  the different Departments&rsquo; respective responsibilities. However, it was  abolished and has not been replaced in any authoritative and comprehensive way.  To be fair, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, which  may have failings in other areas, did step up to the plate in that area in  comparison with other Departments. However, many of the promises that were made  then, for similar moneys to be made available but divvied up through  departmental channels, have not been fulfilled or lived up to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the point of cross-cutting departmental approaches,  every Member of the House should consider that allocating money through the  traditional departmental approach largely serves the interests of the system,  whereas allocating money to funds that are then subject to bids coming up from  the grass roots better serves our constituencies and communities. Such funds  can co-operate and develop their own partnerships, and are better placed to  know their own needs and requirements. A cultural change from what is in this  Budget back towards a cross-cutting model would be useful, at least in part. Undoubtedly,  that would lead to better outcomes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been so much talk of healthcare in the context of  this budgetary debate. An obvious issue is that of obesity, which was mentioned  on the radio today, and the challenges that that will bring evermore. Although  obesity already is an issue, it is going to become more and more of an issue  given the number of overweight and obese children and adults. That will become  a huge drain on the health system and will have all sorts of other effects, not  just on physical and mental health but across a stream of other activities and  across society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obesity is an area that could ideally be addressed by a  cross-cutting approach. Clearly, aspects of the problem must be addressed  through healthcare, but other aspects could usefully be addressed through  education and various other means. We need to move beyond offering platitudes  about how government is working well and actually make government deliver  better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having spoken about funding and funds, I will turn to the  social investment fund. That is a bit of an Orwellian description, I think.  People might have their own descriptions of it, but it epitomises everything  that is wrong with the draft Budget that is before the public and under  consideration by the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The working class and working families are going to be, and  have been, subject to savage welfare cuts coming from the London  Administration. The Minister for Social Development, Mr Attwood, who is my  party colleague, has primary responsibility for tackling poverty and  disadvantage here. He put forward proposals seeking &pound;130 million to address  that issue over four years. I am entirely at a loss to understand how, bearing  those facts in mind, the draft Budget puts forward &pound;20 million in one year to  mitigate all the welfare hardship that will hit the poorest and most vulnerable  families in this region and, at the same time, earmarks &pound;80 million across the  four-year period for a fund, the purpose of which is unclear and the criteria  for which are definitely unclear. In the dying days of this shoddy public  consultation process, we still do not have a page of detail about how that fund  is going to work. It is very clear that communities, including many of the most  impoverished nationalist and republican communities in my city and elsewhere,  have real concerns that it is a slush fund, that people have already been given  secret briefings about the fund, and that there is not, in fact, equality of  opportunity around what is going on here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the moral guardians of the Alliance Party are telling  us that the draft Budget is worth recommending and supporting, I find it  difficult to believe how anybody with any true integrity could stand over  something like this. If people are really serious about tackling extreme  poverty, whether on the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in or Alliance Benches, they should realise  that neighbourhood renewal and other established programmes are the way to go  about doing it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  For those of us who represent constituencies with ever-increasing levels of  unemployment, does the Member accept that now is not the time for secretive  funds to be set up for select organisations, and that now is the time for real  investment in meaningful jobs to get people back into work and to ensure that  the root causes of poverty are addressed by proper, meaningful and paid  employment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  My colleague Mr McGlone makes a valid point. What is most insidious about this  so-called social investment fund, this crony slush fund, is that, ironically,  it delivers elitism back into our public administration, albeit elitism  designed by people who would protest to be anti-Establishment. These are the  same people, in Sinn F&eacute;in and elsewhere, who would tell us that elitism and  privilege cause conflict. It did, it never justified violence, but it certainly  caused conflict and inequality.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. I listened to his earlier  contribution, which was similar to the one that he has just made. He spoke  about secretive funds and select groups being targeted for that money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have absolutely no idea what the Member is  talking about. Perhaps he could enlighten the House. I have had meetings with  your Minister, I represent an area with considerable deprivation and many  interfaces, and I assure you that, from the unionist side of those divides, no  secret deals are being done and no groups are being identified for money. If  you know who they are, please tell us because I have no idea.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">8.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  The Member could usefully have some discussions with the DUP&rsquo;s new-found  friends in Sinn F&eacute;in because they might be in a position to tell you &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I asked you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I reiterate my point: the fact is that it is a secretive business &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I will allow the Member to intervene in one moment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  It is a point of order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I have not heard the Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Mr Humphrey wishes to make a point of order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Member has twice made allegations about  secret groups being targeted with money. I ask him to name those groups  because, on the unionist side, they simply do not exist.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. It is really up to the Member, even after taking an intervention, to  decide whether they want to respond to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  It certainly was not a point of order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the very least, rather than looking at this from the old  zero-sum point of view, the Member should not just be concerned because of what  I have said; surely he should be concerned by the very fact that, unless he  knows something that I do not, he does not know what the money is for. Nobody  out there in the community has been told what purpose it serves.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Somebody has.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  That is quite right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not the sort of new politics that we need. It does  not deliver equality. For people who supposedly espouse republican principles,  Wolfe Tone would be dismayed by the proposal and James Connolly would be  disgusted by it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have allowed some latitude around the Bill, but we are straying far  away from it. I remind all Members to try to deal with the Budget Bill and the  business that is before the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  There is a figure of 1798 in there.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  That is right. I will not confuse things by talking about 1798, 1916 or  anything else, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, another group of people who are  dismayed &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Before I move on to that, the Member could usefully check the Hansard report of  today because a Sinn F&eacute;in Member named two entities &mdash; one in my constituency  and one in West Belfast &mdash; during the debate. Perhaps he should ask her whether  they have been given secret &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I certainly will.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I was in the Chamber when the Sinn F&eacute;in Member did that. I asked you about  areas in unionist communities in North Belfast,  which I represent. I have had meetings with the Minister for Social Development  and SDLP members across the constituency, and I have no idea what you are  talking about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I am happy to let the Member make his own assertion about his knowledge. The  real issue is what other people know and what they are not sharing with  everybody on an equal footing, but I will move on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another group that is dismayed by the Budget is  small-business owners. I think that it was Brian Wilson who mentioned the issue  of rates and the rates burden. People have a real sense of injustice because  they are being crucified with exorbitant rates as they run small businesses in  city centres such as Derry. Some small traders  have told me that their rates bills have increased by over 250% in the past  three years, when, as they see it, there is an almost unstoppable expansion of  out-of-town multiple retail developments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those out-of-town developments do not pay rates at the same  level, and they have all sorts of other advantages, such as accessibility. I  endorse much of what Brian Wilson said on that point, and it would be useful to  explore further what we could do to properly rebalance the rates burden so that  it favours smaller traders, who are trying to keep town and city centres  vibrant and alive. Perhaps some effort could be put into raising rates in  out-of-town environments for large multiples in order to offset the rates  burden for small traders, particularly those who invest in their properties and  businesses and, more generally, in urban regeneration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I will deal with some issues in my constituency.  Pat Ramsey mentioned the huge concern in the north-west about the radiotherapy  centre at Altnagelvin, of which, Mr Speaker, you are well aware. As I said, not  only is it a very important project for Derry city and the wider north-west  area, on both sides of the border, but it is an essential part of future cancer  care provision for everybody, from Dungloe in County Donegal to Downpatrick in  County Down. If the radiotherapy centre does not go ahead, there will be  serious and potentially life-threatening consequences for people across Ulster and,  indeed, outside it. People in the north-west in particular, but also elsewhere,  will find it extremely difficult to forgive politicians who would sacrifice a  major capital project for the sake of what, in the bigger scheme of things, is  quite a small revenue contribution down the line. I echo other colleagues&rsquo; call  that games should not be played with that issue. We need a resolution. Whether  that can be reached on the basis of current arrangements or whether the  Executive need to step in, there must, nevertheless, be a resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke about cross-cutting funds. In the past decade, in  Derry and elsewhere, one of the most useful programmes &mdash; one of the few things  that has actually delivered an economic stimulus and growth &mdash; has been the  integrated development fund, which, although it was accessed in a number of  areas, could have been bigger and made available to more areas. As a result of  that fund, in Derry we have a world class robotics centre at Magee; the airport  road upgrade, which could not have happened without it, is about to open; we  have world class research at the C-TRIC facility at Altnagelvin; we had  investment in the Faughan Valley tourism projects; and we have various other  key projects that have helped to secure and create jobs. Unfortunately, the  Executive decided to abolish the integrated development fund. At the time that  decision was announced, I remember reading reports in the newspapers in which  the deputy First Minister spelled out all the successes of the fund, including  those in the Foyle constituency, when, at the same time, he was signing its  death warrant. That struck me as utterly illogical, although not entirely  surprising when we consider the economic competence of the Administration. It  is not too late to revisit that type of idea, particularly given that we have  disadvantaged areas in which particular problems could be addressed usefully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, Mr Speaker, as you very well know, being a  cultured man yourself, Derry as City of Culture  is coming up in less than two years. As has been mentioned in the Chamber and  elsewhere, some Departments have made bids to secure money. As far as I know,  DSD is the only one to have actually secured money. Indeed, its bid may have  been the only one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Particularly people in the north-west, but those who are  interested in the City of Culture as something which will contribute to  regional life, the regional economy, and nationally on both scales, want that  year to be the best possible. People will be shocked that no identified  priority is given to it in the Budget. That is something that, again, needs to  be usefully reviewed before any Budget for the next four years is set. Nobody  wants the wonderful opportunity of City of Culture not to be fully seized and for our  city and our region not to shine as brightly as they possibly can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The expansion of the University of Ulster  campus at Magee is, without doubt, an essential big-ticket item for the future  economic prosperity of the north-west, and what is good for the economy of the north-west  is good for the economy of this whole region and island. In many ways, more  prescient Members will see that there is a basket of matters that we need to  deliver on for the north-west over the next few years. There is, at the very  least, doubt and concern about whether the current budgetary provision for  employment and learning, in particular, will definitely deliver the kind of  step up and added value that we need in Magee to turn Derry into the type of  university city that it can be. We all know all of the arguments about how  important a large third-level education institution is to ensuring prosperity  over a number of years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 40-odd hours of debate in the House, I have  not once heard the Bain report mentioned, although I will grant that I have not  been here all of the time. Outside Belfast in particular, many people, not  least public sector workers who do long commutes in and out of the city, as  well as other public transport users who share the burden of daily journeys,  would like to see some movement on Bain. The Bain recommendations on public  sector job decentralisation are not something that we should just leave to  chance by passing a Budget for four years, locking ourselves into a framework  and then, after the next election, hearing Ministers say: &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no money  in the Budget, guv.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to have better strategic approaches and planning  for those types of issues, which brings me back to the point that was made by a  number of Members during the debate. Not having a current Programme for  Government for the whole period of the Budget when setting the Budget is a  difficulty, but that is not to say that you should not try to foresee some of  the issues that must be addressed and deal with them as best you can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, earlier, I mentioned 1916, and the road from Derry to Dungiven has a link to 1916. I am sure that you  are waiting for this. In 2008, that road was categorised by Roads Service as  being in the preparation pool. I understand that to mean that it would be  completed or at least under construction within five years. We are now three  years beyond that, and this Budget will take us two years beyond the end of the  period of &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. We need to be careful that we do not end up discussing a full four-year  Budget. That debate will happen later on, in another sitting, so let us be  careful. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Order. I agree with some of the Member&rsquo;s comments  concerning the north-west. I agree with those all right.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.] </span>However, let us be very careful. We are almost now straying  into discussing a four-year Budget, so be very careful.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">8.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Is that not what we are talking about?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No, we are certainly not talking about that tonight. It is not about a  four-year Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  One way or the other, it is fair to say<span class="Italic"> &mdash; [Interruption.] </span>Do  not worry; I am near the end, Mr Speaker. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  The fact remains that we have a Budget and we are now told that the Derry to Dungiven dualling project will not be completed  or even started. Not a sod will be turned. That is not conducive to the prompt  delivery of the future economic prosperity of the north-west and, again, that  is a major failing and flaw in this Budget. I refer Members once again to the  various alternative proposals and propositions that we have put forward, which  mean that that type of failure to deliver does not have to be a fait accompli.  We can do things differently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance said earlier today that we have to  learn how to live with the cuts imposed by London. As I said at the time, that is the  wrong approach to take. That approach does not best serve our constituents and  our communities, and we need to be more ambitious and aim higher than that. We  need to learn how to deal with this crisis in our Budget, and there are  proposals on the table. It is not too late to improve the Budget, and it is  time that every party in this Chamber &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I will.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Speaker. If I promise him  the money for the A6, the A5, the City of Culture,  Altnagelvin and cross-border initiatives, will he sit down?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I will be happy to hold him to that promise. I make absolutely no apologies for  speaking up for people in my constituency, and I hope that the Minister of  Finance and Personnel takes on board the points that he has been listening to  very attentively. Mr McCallister, did you want to intervene?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  No, the Minister beat me to it.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I am sorry to disappoint you both. I was actually in my final sentence.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  It is time that we stepped up to the plate and did better.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for warming up the audience so well. Rarely have I  heard such a detailed announcement. However, I will try to be brief. Mr  Callaghan said that he would not be brief; he certainly did not disappoint us  on that bit. During debates such as this, we sometimes want to get points  across, and I want to deal with a particular issue. I do not wish to detain  people for too long. However, for some clarification, I wonder who would have  said: &ldquo;I do not want to be seen as pleading a special case for Northern Ireland, or saying that we should be  exempt from the disciplines that exist in other parts of the United Kingdom.  That is why, on the determination of the budget in Northern Ireland, I have  argued that what has happened to the block grant as a result of the Barnett  consequential &mdash; the Secretary of State talked about it being a good deal, but  actually it is not a particularly good or bad deal; it is the kind of deal we  would have expected to get, given the settlements that have been made for other  Departments across the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will in a moment. I want to finish this little bit. I wonder who would have  said: &ldquo;I and my party have not joined in the siren calls to &lsquo;resist the Tory  cuts&rsquo; and to ignore what is a reality.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That might help. I wonder who might have said that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  My guess is that it is probably the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I  caution my colleague from Lagan   Valley, considering that,  before he rose to his feet, the Minister of Finance and Personnel offered him  for Lisburn a city of culture, a university, a harbour and an airport if he  kept his speech short. Therefore, he may not want to upset him too much.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  How do you get a harbour in Lisburn?<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The River Lagan.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Speaker &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member must be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  That is what is wrong with this place. There is no sense of can do. It is  always &ldquo;no we cannot&rdquo;. I want a harbour for Lisburn, and I think that we should  get it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  You have a river.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  We have a river, but it was nothing to do with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel. That river was there before he got the job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an issue, because, as certain colleagues said, it  was the Minister of Finance and Personnel, Sammy Wilson, who made those remarks  at the Northern Ireland Grand Committee and continued:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Departments in England  and in Great Britain  have had certain reductions made to their budgets. As a result of the Barnett  consequentials, those reductions feed through to Northern Ireland, so we have to  live with those budgets.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot understand why Members on the DUP Benches  challenge the Tory cuts when the Minister of Finance and Personnel accepts  them. In his words, he said that the deal was neither good nor bad and that it  was a Budget that we should accept. Therefore, I cannot understand why, when I  look at the health budget, it appears that per capita spending is different  from England and Wales. For the  first time, England will be  above the per capita spend of Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I do not understand why, when we look at the  education budget, we see nothing but destruction. We have not talked about that  in as much detail, but there will be redundancies. It is said that the  Department of Education has the worst outcome of all Departments. I do not  understand when I look at the budget for the Department for Employment and  Learning and see the difficulties that it faces. When I go through all of the  budget cuts, I do not understand why we seem to be worse off than other regions  of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with an issue, which I put out to Members  from the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. To those Members who talk about resisting cuts:  where were you when the votes were taken? Were you in the Chamber or were you  in Westminster?<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am quite happy to take interventions from anyone who wants to bring it on  now. Let us just see what you have got, or you can sit there and cower on the  Back Benches, because we will expose your &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member should not point. The Member can point at me if he wants.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you. I appreciate that direction, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why, on 7 June 2010, did the DUP vote with the  Conservatives to defeat an Opposition amendment criticising the Liberal and  Conservative Programme for Government? If the DUP was so set against the Tory  Programme for Government, why did it defend those plans? On 8 June, the DUP  voted with the Conservatives to defeat an Opposition amendment to the Queen&rsquo;s  Speech. That amendment would have registered a protest on Conservative plans  for the economy. If the DUP was so against the Government&rsquo;s plans, why did it  defend them? On 7 July, the DUP voted with the Conservatives to oppose an  Opposition motion that noted concerns over the emergency Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I hear all the tripe about opposition to Tory cuts, it  shows me that the DUP says one thing in another place and another thing here.  Although I am not talking about anyone in particular, it seems to me that we  are not speaking with any form of clarity on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Had the Ulster Unionist Party been fortunate enough to have had anyone elected  at the previous Westminster  election, would the Member&rsquo;s party have gone into the Lobby with the Tories to  vote to impose those cuts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am interested in that point, with which I agree. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let the Member be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I agree that we face a serious financial reality. The  Finance Minister said that for every &pound;4 that we spend in the United Kingdom,  we borrow &pound;1. That is not sustainable. We have to do something about it.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.] </span>I am happy if other Members wish to  intervene and stand up and be heard. I do not know whether Members can hear  with clarity what I am saying. For every &pound;4 that we spend, we borrow &pound;1. That  is not sustainable. We will have to find ways of making cuts and efficiencies.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.] </span>Is there a problem with the word &ldquo;cuts&rdquo;?  People here shy away from doing what has to be done, and I do not like that. We  need open, transparent and real debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  No, I will not give way. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I will gladly give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  With reference to the last question, can we take that as a yes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thought that I was going to be savaged, but it was more of a limp-wristed  effort. This party criticises others for doing exactly what it says. The DUP  voted with the Conservative Party when it had the opportunity not to do so.  That is the real issue. If you want to talk about serious Programmes for  Government, you need inclusive debate. You need to ensure that you extract the  details and can make real decisions. The problem with the draft Budget in all  its guises is that it is rushed and light on detail. We do not know what the  implications are. Therefore, we cannot make decisions on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a candyfloss draft Budget: pink, sickly and fluffy. I  expect that we will start making the hard decisions after 5 May. This is a  draft Budget to get certain parties through an election; it is not a draft  Budget for the people of Northern    Ireland. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am happy to take interventions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Is it not the case that the two Ministries held by the Member&rsquo;s party have not  provided the detail, so it is those Ministers who have been light on detail and  not those from other parties?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am glad that I initiated some dialogue on that matter because I have  difficulties with the details that have come through on the education budget.  There are other budgets, and the point that I think &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Yes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Earlier, the Member seemed to assert that the  issue with education was the result of some deal between us and Sinn F&eacute;in. He  tried to make the assertion that he had been kept out and that he was not aware  of all that was going on. I challenge the Member to tell the House if, at any  time when I had anything to do with education, I excluded him. Was there ever a  situation about which I did not keep him informed? Will he clarify the  situation, or was he just trying to score cheap political points to try to get  through the election because he knows that that will be a big task for him and  his party.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Please address your remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is hard to prove a negative.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. Allow the Member to be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  In conclusion, the issue with the draft Budget is that there seem to be a  number of individual budgets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I support collective discussion, openness and  transparency. The issue comes down to the Programme for Government. I would  like to find a way to do what is right for all the people of Northern Ireland.  On that basis, I will rest my case.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">9.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  Members will all be delighted to hear that I am the last person to speak in the  debate before the Minister. I promise that I will be brief &mdash; and I mean brief.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Stephen Farry, my party colleague, has already given the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s general response, I will just mention briefly a couple of  points on the DSD draft budget. I am concerned about the social housing  development programme. Its budget allocation allows for only around 4,000 new  homes to be built in the next four years. In 2010-11, we hope to build nearly  2,000 new homes. In 2007, the Semple review recommended that we build 2,000  homes a year over five years to address the housing shortage. Therefore, the  draft budget&rsquo;s plan to build 1,000 new homes a year nowhere near meets the  demand for housing that exists now, with more than 30,000 people on the Housing  Executive&rsquo;s waiting list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft budget&rsquo;s anticipated capital receipts for land  and house sales each year for the next four years is about &pound;100 million per  annum. Is that realistic, given that, in 2009-10, receipts were only &pound;18  million against a baseline of &pound;69 million and, in 2010-11, the forecast is only  &pound;2&middot;2 million against a baseline of &pound;13 million? It is, obviously, a far cry  from the expectation of realising &pound;100 million a year for the next four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that any extra funding for housing depends on  the idea of getting contributions from housing association reserves. Minister  Wilson suggested that &pound;20 million per annum could be obtained in that way. I  feel very sorry for the Minister. He has been sitting there for two whole days  listening to all of us gurning about the Budget. However, he suggested an  amount of &pound;20 million a year, which is &pound;80 million in total over the four  years. While I accept that there is, perhaps, scope to make better use of  housing association reserves, how realistic is it that we will get that money?  Minister Attwood said that the &pound;80 million is an arbitrary figure that was  produced without consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Federation of Housing Associations  maintains that reserves are for maintenance of homes during their entire  economic life. They are for paying back loans and safeguarding against future  risk. Housing associations are charities. They are independent of the  Government, who have no legal power to extract reserves from them. In a recent  e-mail to us, housing associations offered to take a 5% cut on the housing  associations&rsquo; grant over the next four years, which will give us &pound;15 million.  However, obviously, that is well short of the &pound;80 million that has been  mentioned. Therefore, if the projected capital receipts are not realised and  housing associations&rsquo; contributions are far less than the anticipated &pound;80  million, the social housing programme could have a serious shortfall over the  next four years, similar to that which we faced over the past four years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: At this stage, I suppose that I could make everybody  happy by saying that we had this debate last night and I gave my answer then,  so thank you very much and goodnight. I will not. I have no intention of doing  so. However, I thank Members. Considering that Members gave up romantic  evenings with their loved ones last night, I thought that nobody would want to  say anything in this debate today. However, I had forgotten that some Members  did sneak off last night and had their candlelit dinners, and they have come in  today to go through the whole procedure. We have been here since 10.00 am. We  will try to do a 12-hour stint. Let us see what happens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a wide-ranging debate. I think that some  Members have not understood what the debate is about. The Member for South  Belfast Conall McDevitt does a lovely line in patronising Members. In fact, he  did about an hour and a half of it during the debate. If he is going to  patronise us, I would love to think that he would at least get his facts right  before doing so. I want to put my comments in the context of what the debate is  about. He started off by saying that, had there been a more collegiate  approach, had the Executive listened to the SDLP and had we read both versions  of its tedious documents &mdash; the one from 18 months ago and the one from &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  1916.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Yes; 1916. Had that happened, we would have had no  need for accelerated passage of the Budget Bill, because we would have had a  Budget Bill well prepared in advance, and we could have been working at it from  September. I do not know whether he listened to what I said at the start of the  debate. Clearly his party leader did. She was on-message, but he was not. Let  me remind Members what the Budget Bill that we have been talking about all day  is about: it is giving us the legal authority to spend the cash that we used  over 2010-11. That cash altered right up until the February monitoring round.  The Bill will also give us the ability to spend the cash, which was voted  through on the Vote on Account, for the first number of months in the next  year, so that we have continuity. Given that we had reallocations of money  right up until the February monitoring round, how could we possibly have had  this Budget Bill done and dusted and through Committee and everything else in  September? Mr McDevitt got lots of other things wrong. I want to come to those  later, because there were so many. I want to put it on record that that is what  the debate and the Budget Bill are about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the Bill is going through by accelerated  passage is not a sign of failure. I know that the Member is looking for all  kinds of failures. Indeed, that is all we have heard all day from the SDLP. It  is not a sign of failure by the Executive if they agree something. At this  stage, we have to get the Bill through quickly for it to get Royal Assent, so  that we can spend the money next year. I will do a bit of patronising now, Mr  Speaker. Now that the Member has got a lesson in that, he will not repeat the  same mistake the next time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  would not bet on it. It is the SDLP that you are talking about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I would not bet on it either. I will go through some  of the points that have been raised by Members during the day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay, the Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel  Committee, raised a number of issues. I will deal with some of those points.  The first that he raised was the fact that he would like to see more fiscal  powers devolved to the Assembly. I think that Mr McLaughlin and others also  raised that point. Indeed, the Chairperson of the Committee, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd and  other Sinn F&eacute;in Members talked about how we have to shake ourselves free of the  British Exchequer and of Britain&rsquo;s  control of our budgets. I know that Sinn F&eacute;in Members may have their republican  ideals and everything else. However, I have to say to them that, at a time when  we have a deficit in public spending of &pound;7&middot;5 billion and not much chance of  closing that from local revenues, wanting to break free of what they call the  shackles of fiscal chains from Westminster is a very dangerous road to go down.  First, as a unionist, I would certainly not want to go down that route, and,  secondly, as Finance Minister, I would warn against it for people in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The deficit is likely to get larger as we go through this  Budget period. Simply having tax powers devolved to Northern Ireland is one thing, but  we need to ask what taxes we would raise to fill that deficit. Through the  discussions on corporation tax, we know that there will always be a bill  attached to it and that it is not always likely to be in our favour. That  brings me to the point that the Member raised about corporation tax. Whether we  should reduce our corporation tax is an important strategic issue that we have  had to discuss in the Executive and the Assembly. My view is very clear, and I  have made it clear time and time again. Despite the eagerness of the Secretary  of State to rush us into that, I think that, as an Assembly, we need to be  careful. We need to examine the price tag and other options closely. I know  that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has suggested many other  things that ought to be included in any document that deals with rebalancing  the economy and that may focus the allowances and reductions in corporation tax  without leaving us with the same tax bill as Westminster would impose on us. Of  course, not only do we need to look at that, but we need to look at phasing it  in, at the costs of that if we do it over a period of time and at an early  engagement with the European Commission. Before we go down that route, we have  to make explicit what the benefits and costs are going to be. Anybody would  expect that from any responsible politician. To date, we do not have that  information available to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay and a number of other Members raised the issue of  the Altnagelvin radiotherapy unit. That raises an important issue for the  Assembly, and it throws the ball back into the Health Minister&rsquo;s court. That is  because, depending on what audience he has been speaking to, over the Budget  period, the Health Minister has had different priorities for the capital budget  for health. Whenever he goes to Dundonald hospital, that has the priority,  because there is a sewer or something running through the middle of a building.  However, whenever he goes to the Royal, that has the priority, and whenever he  goes to Londonderry, Altnagelvin has the  priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may tell me, as Finance Minister, that he has  a priority and that he wants it included in his capital budget. If it is a  priority, he has to find the money for it within his revenue budget. People  cannot say that something is a priority in their capital budget and then, when  they get the money, say that, by the way, they have not planned for how they  are going to run it. In the case of Altnagelvin, of course, we must remember  the important point that we also have the contribution from the Government in  the Irish Republic, not just for the capital costs  but for the running costs. That relates to the point that Mr Farry made, and I  will be a bit more explicit about that later on.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">9.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a unionist, I have no difficulty with the idea of the  Executive co-operating with the Government in the Republic to look at how we  can share facilities. Of course we will look at that if it makes economic sense  and improves services for people along a land border. It is particularly  galling that the Health Minister says, first, that that is a priority and,  secondly, that he has some finance available from the Republic for the capital  and running costs and then says, &ldquo;By the way, I have not made it a priority in  my current spending&rdquo;. Maybe that is part of the dysfunction that we see with  health spending.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow asked whether Barnett consequentials applied to  the Department of Justice even though its budget is ring-fenced. The answer is  yes. The whole point of ring-fencing the Department of Justice budget and  keeping it separate from our own Budget was that, in doing so, the Government  at Westminster were then obliged to give us a package of measures that included  access to the contingency fund, protection for EYF and money for some of the  compensation claims &mdash; hearing loss etc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP plays a dangerous game when it says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  interfere with that ring-fencing. Let&rsquo;s take &pound;7 million from the Department of  Justice&rdquo;. In doing so, they open the door for the Treasury to say, &ldquo;Well, if  you believe that you have sufficient money to go into the Department of Justice  budget and to take money out of it, then you do not need the money that we have  promised&rdquo;. There again, we see the kind of shallow thinking contained in what  is supposed to be a well-thought-out policy and amendment that the SDLP brought  to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Morrow also raised the issue of the contingency fund and  whether the Department of Justice and the police could have access to it not on  a yearly basis but on a committed basis for the next four years. The police  made a very good argument for that. They said that as far as they are concerned  there is a threat. It is agreed nationally that there is a threat. The security  services say that there is a threat. The security services have been financed  for that threat. The police are saying, &ldquo;Look, rather than have year-on-year  applications to that contingency fund, if we had access to it for the four  years that would enable us to plan and spend the money in a better way&rdquo;. That  is the debate that we have been having with the Treasury. All I can say to Lord  Morrow about that is that my officials, in contact with Treasury officials,  have made very good progress on that issue, and we look forward to a positive  outcome for the case that has been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow and other Members, including, I think, Mr  McGlone, raised the issue of Desertcreat and asked whether it would go ahead.  The capital funds are there. There is a dispute in that the Fire and Rescue  Service element has not been settled with the Health Minister. I support what a  lot of Members said about having a collegiate approach to the Budget. There is  a failure to approach in a collegiate way even a simple matter such as that,  even when the Health Minister knows that it makes sense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have training facilities that are totally inadequate and  a training budget for the Fire and Rescue Service that is there anyway and  could probably be spent much more effectively in the purpose-built, up-to-date  training facility that will be available at Desertcreat. Yet what do we get  from the Health Minister? That money is available for the capital spend, but he  is not prepared to supply the running costs. However, the running costs are  already incorporated into his budget. How are Fire and Rescue Service personnel  currently trained? Where does the money for that training go?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are probably economies to be had from having all the  training in one place. If the Health Minister were thinking ahead, he would be  looking at the prime site occupied by the Fire and Rescue Service on the Boucher Road. That  should not be used for dealing with car crashes, burning fires and parking fire  engines; it is a prime retail site. Surely to goodness, looking ahead, a  capital receipt could be had from that. What do we have next door to that? We  have Health Service warehousing &mdash; in the middle of a prime retail site. So,  with a bit of forward thinking, there are opportunities to make savings, to  gain capital receipts and to have proper training services for the Fire and  Rescue Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow also raised the issue of the PSNI hearing loss  claims. He said that he understood that the money for those claims had to come  from the Executive. That was never the case; the cost was always to come from  the police budget, which was financed for that purpose. The first &pound;12 million  is paid from the DOJ budget, and any claim after that is paid for by the  Treasury. In 2010-11, there was a claim for &pound;23 million, with &pound;12 million paid  by the Department of Justice and &pound;11 million paid by the Treasury.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now come to Mr Beggs and his points. He and a number of  other Members raised the issue of funding to the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of  Ulster. That issue needs to be taken up with the Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development. Given the amount of money involved and the fact that there  is a lot of community return on it, I would have thought that something could  be found in the DARD budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also raised the issue of DARD headquarters  moving and the fact that &pound;16 million of capital had been allocated for it in  the budget. As far as we are concerned, DFP has responsibility for estate  management across the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and I would expect the  Agriculture Minister to be in contact with me first. If there were then a  transfer of funding to DFP for the moving of DARD headquarters, a business case  would have to be made, and only then would a judgement be made. That would be a  call on the DARD budget.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs also raised the A5 and A2 roads projects and  expressed some scepticism on whether the money being spent on the A5 was best  spent given its usage. It is up to the Minister for Regional Development to  prioritise those projects, and he has made the A5 a priority. There is &pound;274  million coming from Dublin for the project, and  the construction industry in Northern Ireland  has welcomed that as an additional capital injection into Northern Ireland.  However, there will be a public inquiry into the project, which will start in  May. There will also be uncertainty about the budgetary arrangements after the  election in the Irish   Republic. That will have  to be kept under review. Obviously, if the money from the Republic were not  made available, given the size of the project, it could not be financed through  the Northern Ireland Budget alone, and there would have to be a reassessment of  the priorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs also raised the issue of improvements to the A2 at  Greenisland. To date, &pound;16 million has been invested in that project, so a  considerable amount of public money has already gone into it. He and I share an  interest in that project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the capital allocation to the Department for Regional  Development, &pound;24&middot;4 million has been made available for next year, &pound;22&middot;5 million  has been made available for 2012, and &pound;8&middot;2 million has been made available for  2013-14. However, I have to give a health warning again because, although the  money is included in the capital budget, the priorities are set by the Minister  for Regional Development. There again, lobbying is important, if Members wish  those projects to be brought forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also raised the issue of health funding in East Antrim and health centres in particular. I think  that he is best placed to talk to the Health Minister. I hope he talks to his  own colleagues more than he talks to me. There are good reasons to look at the  health infrastructure in Northern    Ireland, and small health centres could  complement a smaller number of regional acute hospitals. That is probably the  way in which the health estate should go, yet, at a time when restructuring is  needed and the Health Minister has been made aware that considerable savings  can be made from that restructuring, it surprises me that that he wants to take  money out of the capital side of his budget and put it into current  expenditure. He should perhaps consider using some of his capital to  restructure and make certain savings as a result.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs and a number of other Members raised the issue of  job losses in the Health Service. We have been told that there will be 4,000  job losses, and I am annoyed at the way that that figure was thrown into the  air. When challenged on that, the Health Minister said that it was a rough  estimate. I suspect that he looked at his budget, estimated what the reduction  in that budget would be, divided that by the cost of each nurse and came to the  figure of 4,000 redundancies, despite the fact that he could make many other  efficiencies. That figure might make a good headline for the Minister, but it  ignores the fact that many of those who work in the Health Service are left  wondering where they stand and whether their job is safe. That creates fear and  uncertainty for which there is no need. When it comes to cuts, Ministers must  be mindful of the impact that they have on people. It is easy to throw these  things out. They may make good headlines, may start good discussions and may  create a bit of leverage in their budgets, but it shows no consideration for  those who are impacted by the bad news that comes from those statements,  whether they are truthful or not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We then came to the very long contribution by Mr McDevitt.  We have all these sayings now like &ldquo;White is the new black&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Astra is  the new Mercedes&rdquo;, and I think that Conall McDevitt is the new Declan O&rsquo;Loan.<span class="Italic"> </span>He can certainly match his party colleague in the time  that he can take up on the Floor. He started off with a misunderstanding of  what the Budget Bill is about and then went on to show that he misunderstood  many other things in the draft Budget. Last night, I accused the SDLP of  engaging in a kind of fiscal feeding of the 5,000. That party seemed to suggest  that it could cut &pound;22&middot;1 million from departmental budgets, and, with that,  finance student fees, the Health Service, poverty, tourism etc. Brandishing his  document, Mr McDevitt has tried to turn water into wine.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.] </span>It was &ldquo;whine&rdquo; with an h; the Member is absolutely  right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to go over some of the things that Mr McDevitt said.  His first criticism of the draft Budget was that it lacked imagination, yet  some of the things that he said stretched my imagination to the point that I  felt that I was almost in a fantasy world. According to Mr McDevitt, the SDLP  has published a cunning plan that will sort out all our troubles, fill the  &pound;4,000 million gap that has been left in our Budget and leave us with nothing  to worry about.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">9.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One has to look at some of the things that Mr McDevitt  claimed. First, according to him, he has all these revenue streams in the  Budget. He claimed that we can raise money. He talked about the mutualisation  of water and how, if the water service were mutualised, we would not have to  have water charges. He said that we could also have bonds &mdash; peace bonds or  cross-community bonds &mdash; and could borrow &pound;600 million a year. When Mr Farry  challenged him on that, he said that it could not be done under Treasury rules  at present, but that we will go to the Treasury with a special case: a special  case for water; a special case for bonds; and a special case for borrowing. The  whole point is that we got into this problem because we had too much borrowing.  The Government are trying to cut borrowing. Is it likely that they will make a  special case for a whole range of SDLP fantasy methods of raising revenue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will give way in a moment or two.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to Mr McDevitt, it should be easy because we got  a &pound;175 million borrowing arrangement for the PMS. Arlene Foster, Peter Robinson  and Martin McGuinness could tell us just how hard it was to get that from the  Treasury. It came after one and a half years of negotiation with the Treasury  for one specific issue that will not be repeated. Nevertheless, Mr McDevitt  thinks that we can raise hundreds of millions of pounds and go with special  case after special case and that the Treasury will somehow exempt Northern Ireland  from the public expenditure rules. I do not think so. That is the first hole in  the &pound;4,000 million that the SDLP is supposed to be providing for us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate the fact that the Minister has given way, and I thank him for his  earlier clarification. He undoubtedly remains a very good teacher, and perhaps  that is where his true vocation lies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister address the very large hole in the  proposed revenue streams in the Budget? His departmental officials are saying  that we cannot claim the &pound;807 million that we are trying to claim. We are  looking at something more like &pound;262 million. Rather than critiquing the SDLP&rsquo;s  revenue proposals, perhaps he can clarify why there is such a large hole  already in his own revenue proposals and what consequences he believes that  will have for our Budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There is not a hole in our revenue proposals. Let us  look at our revenue proposals. First, we have an increase in the regional rate,  and that increase will deliver. We can calculate the amount of money that will  come from that. We have a sure one there. I will come to Mr Callaghan&rsquo;s contribution  later; even the SDLP is not sure about its proposals on the regional rate.  After listening to Mr Callaghan, we can identify another hole in the SDLP&rsquo;s  proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we have revenue from Departments from the assets  that they have identified and intend to sell. They are surplus to requirements  and amount to &pound;400 million. Those assets have not yet been sold, but  Departments have identified that they are available for sale. We have no reason  to overstate their price, because spending proposals will be based on their  value.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to Mr McDevitt, we have got ourselves into an  interesting hole, in that we have identified assets &mdash; buildings and so on &mdash;  worth &pound;100 million that will go for sale and leaseback. If Mr McDevitt is  saying that that is not a very secure source of revenue, perhaps he should read  his own document, which predicts not that we could get &pound;100 million from that  source but &pound;250 million. I have read his document more than he has. If that is  the case, either the SDLP has overstated it, or it bears out the argument that  I have making all along, which is that we have been prudent in the figures that  we have put into the document. We have underestimated it, because I do not want  to find, at the end of this period, that we have put stuff into the document  that should not have been there or was not realisable. That is one of the  reasons why that figure is reduced to that level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other source is where we have changed from current  spending to capital spending. There is &pound;252 million there. That is what the  Executive have voted for. Some Ministers have said that they wish to reverse  it. If that is the case, the figure will be changed, but only with the assent  of the Executive and the Assembly. So there will be debate and discussion about  that, and Ministers may make a case for change. I would prefer them not to,  but, if they make that case, it must be changed only after due consideration  has been given.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue has been the income from the Port of Belfast, which is far, far less than the  SDLP suggests in its document. Talk about double counting: the SDLP is not only  going to get a dividend from the Port   of Belfast, it will sell  it. How they will sell it and get a dividend, I am not sure. We get either a  capital receipt or a dividend. However, we have the best of both worlds with  the SDLP. I might want to discuss that with SDLP Members. How can I persuade  the port to go into private ownership and then, on top of that, give us a  dividend back so that we get a capital receipt and a revenue stream from it?  Perhaps I can get an explanation of that later. Rather than talk about holes in  our capital budget, if the SDLP is so good at identifying holes in budgets, how  come this document got past the beady eye of Mr McDevitt? I do not understand that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened all day to how the SDLP could have solved  all our problems for us. I have highlighted only a couple of the things that it  has suggested. Let us take another one: the SDLP says that the sale of the  airport at Londonderry could bring in &pound;37  million. Maybe the SDLP is better at these things than we are, but we have just  given Londonderry council &pound;8<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>6 million for the airport because  it runs at a deficit. The council could not afford to pay for the health and  safety improvements. It predicts that the airport will run at a deficit for the  next number of years, but it is prepared to take on that deficit. Here is an  airport that will run at a deficit, but someone will pay &pound;37 million for it.  Again, I would like to know how that kind of figure is brought about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Those are two interesting points, and I appreciate the Minister giving me the  opportunity to clarify them. If the Minister reads our paper, he will see that  the Port of Belfast is landlord of a very large area  that is not currently used for port services. The land is sitting there. It can  be disposed of, and there will still be a very profitable port doing port  business. We can continue to take a dividend off that port. So it is not a  question of either/or; we can do both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As to the port and airport at Derry,  I refer the Minister to page 47 in the paper, where he will see that it is not  just City of Derry Airport, but the airport and the port. You must look at them  as a package, which is an entirely different proposition to the one he very  correctly identified in his remarks.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Well, I mean &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. Would he care to comment on the fact that  the Port of Belfast  has just recently been able to secure a &pound;40 million investment by a company in  the renewable energy sphere solely because it has that land to offer that  company, thereby bringing &pound;40 million into the city of Belfast  and into Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am glad that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment raised that issue, because it is exactly the point that I wanted to  make. The Port of   Belfast has other  projects in the pipeline, but it believes that the land that the SDLP wants to  sell off can be used to create jobs and bring in extra revenue and, therefore,  is valuable for the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me move on for a minute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested in the exchange of views. It is not for me  to get involved in the row between the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in. I agree with and  support the SDLP on this matter, because I am glad that it is moving away from  the old left-wing rhetoric that it used to get involved in. There was an  interesting exchange between Mr McDevitt and Mr O&rsquo;Dowd on whether the SDLP  supported privatisation. Of course, the argument was that the SDLP did not  support privatisation except, maybe, for one or two little examples. I welcome  the SDLP&rsquo;s move to the right. However, let us look at the document and the kind  of privatisation that the SDLP wants to have. It wants to privatise car parks.  Mr McDevitt explained that it was far better to put car parks in the private  sector. The SDLP wants to privatise MOT centres, forests and the headquarters of  the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. It wants to privatise parts of the Port of Belfast, the Speaker&rsquo;s house, allotments  and rate collections. I have it all noted down; well, those are probably a good  enough start.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is the party of privatisation, but, in fact, Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd hit only the tip of the iceberg. I am quite happy that the SDLP wants to  move in that direction. Where there are assets that can be sold, of course we  want to sell them. However, whether it likes to admit it or not, it is  important to recognise that the SDLP wants to privatise the water service. Let  me make this clear: if we are going to raise money for the capital required by  the water service, an income stream guaranteed by the Government is not  sufficient to escape Treasury rules. It must be an independent revenue stream,  and the only one available is water charges. Let us not run away from the  issue. If that is the route that the SDLP wants to go down, that is fine, but  it should at least be honest about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The one comment that I have heard from the SDLP all day &mdash; I  am nauseated by it &mdash; is that we need transparency. However, every time we try  to nail down the SDLP on exactly what it means or where it is going, it  wriggles away. I will come to transparency in a minute or two when I talk about  Mr Callaghan. He is the most opaque of them all. I do not recall whether I was  sleeping at the time. If we want transparency, let us be honest about the route  that we are going down. The SDLP is the party of privatisation, and maybe that  is a good step forward. However, in its conflict with Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP  cannot pretend that it is more left-wing. The SDLP cannot pretend that other  parties are Tories and it is swathed in the red flag to protect the workers&rsquo;  rights and so on. It is not the green SDLP that is hidden in its document; it  is the blue SDLP. Its Members sit on the blue Benches, and that has done them a  world of good.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I never thought that the Minister would be so interested in and excited about  an SDLP document. He is an economist of a certain generation who was taught a  certain type of economics. We could debate the issue in and out all night, but  the fact is that mutualisation guarantees that Northern Ireland Water will  never be privatised because it puts it in the hands of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may find it difficult to conceptualise that.  He is from a generation that does not exactly find co-operativism the currency  of the day. His suggestion that there is a Treasury embargo or prevention on  being able to treat a constant and guaranteed public revenue stream as a secure  form of funding shows that he does not really know too much about bond markets.  Bond markets do not care where the money comes from as long as it is  guaranteed, which is what our proposal does.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">9.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I just hope &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind all Members that interventions should be short and to the  point.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Absolutely. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I hope  that the Member has equality-proofed his last comment, because there was a  touch of ageism in it. He said that I was of a certain generation. The SDLP is  a party that talks about equality, the Equality Commission and everything else.  If the Equality Commission looks at those remarks, he will be getting a visit  from someone tomorrow morning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am interested in the way in which the SDLP has addressed  this issue. It has talked about our proposals being vague, but the amendment  that it proposed to the Budget last night could not have been any more vague.  The SDLP has talked about our proposals being full of holes. However, having gone  through the SDLP document, we have seen the holes in it at both a high and  shallow level. In fact, the SDLP now denies even some its own proposals. In an  earlier intervention, Mrs Kelly talked about the proposal to protect jobs first  through a recruitment freeze and then a pay freeze. Her view was that, if we  are not recruiting people, no new jobs will be created. Then, by Jove, what did  I find when I turned to the SDLP document? The SDLP suggests that a way of  saving jobs may be through a recruitment freeze and, indeed, that another way  of saving jobs might be through a pay freeze. The SDLP now denies even its own  document.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In an intervention on a Sinn F&eacute;in Member&rsquo;s speech, Mr  McDevitt talked about the fact that we are hoping to put money into the capital  budget by taking &pound;20 million from the housing associations. That, according to  him, is a ridiculous idea. I wonder where that idea came from. As I turn the  page of this document, I see that, in year 1 and year 2, the SDLP would get  extra finance for the capital budget by taking &mdash; how much and from whom? &mdash; &pound;20  million from the housing associations. The SDLP denies even its own document.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I like the one about planning gain/developer contributions,  which amount to a sizeable &pound;120 million over the four years of the Budget. What  does the SDLP say? It says that the Department of the Environment has now  folded on the consideration of developer contributions. The SDLP document  states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We believe however that it is important that a  developer contribution is on the statute book ready for application when the  economic strictures around the construction sector begin to ease.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Nearly every SDLP Member talked about the dire  straits that the construction sector is in and the fact that we need to find  more money to put into the construction sector to retain employment. Those  Members said that we may even go into a double-dip recession because of the  Tory cuts and this inept Budget. Indeed, according to the SDLP, it is not a  recession but a depression. I would have thought, therefore, that it would not  be possible to get any developer contributions and that it would just be on the  statute book. It is not on the statute book; it is in the Budget &mdash; &pound;120  million. Either the situation is so constricted for the construction industry  that we cannot get that sum because we are in a recession, or the situation has  improved before we have got the Budget agreed and we can get &pound;120 million.  Maybe the SDLP will explain whether it is on the statute book or is real money  in the Budget. If it is the latter, we have a bit of a hole. Maybe Mr O&rsquo;Loan  will make a better stab at explaining the SDLP&rsquo;s document than Mr McDevitt did.  Let us hear him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  am delighted with the attention that the SDLP document is getting from the  Finance Minister. His party colleagues are getting a tutorial in useful  economics. I hope that the Minister will continue with that; he has obviously  had his officials look closely at the document. Between now and the  presentation of the final Budget and thereafter across the four-year period, I  hope that he will continue to look at those proposals and have them examined by  his officials and tested and modified, if necessary. I am perfectly comfortable  with that. What the Minister is actually presenting is that there is real  substance in the proposals that will significantly benefit the Executive and  the people whom we represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The particular proposal is no different to the Minister&rsquo;s  presentation on Belfast port, in which he said that we will need legislation  but that in future years we can bring that forward. It is sensible to put the  matter of a developer contribution on the statute book. We hope that the  economic situation will be such that the benefit will be realised before the  end of the four-year period.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I listened to the explanation, but that is not what  his document says. Read your document, for goodness&rsquo; sake. At least I had the  decency to read through it. This is not a case of saying that, at least by the  end of the four-year period, we might be able to get some developer  contributions. In year 1, you are going to get &pound;20 million; in year 2, you are  going to get &pound;30 million; in year 3, you are going to get &pound;30 million; and in  year 4, you are going to get &pound;40 million. At least we now have an admission  that there is a &pound;120 million hole. Mr O&rsquo;Loan is saying that we should put it on  the statute book and that, maybe by the end of the four years, we can get some  money out of it. Well, that is not what the document says; it says that you  will get it from the very first year. That is yet another example of a hole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that we have got up to &pound;4 for this Budget  contribution rather than &pound;4 million. I could keep going through the document,  but I want to move on to one final point. I really like this one. SDLP Members  were lining themselves up to be holier-than-thou on the issue of student fees,  saying that they had nothing to do with it. I am not too sure whether Mr  Callaghan &mdash; is he from Londonderry?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Yes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not know whether his name is P&oacute;l Callaghan or  Pol Pot, but, if the latter rewrote the history of Cambodia, Mr Callaghan is  trying to rewrite the history of the SDLP &mdash; in other words, the SDLP had  nothing to do with students who are paying fees. I have a BBC news report from  21 November 2000. You can never trust the BBC, Mr Deputy Speaker, so, in case  the BBC got it wrong, I also have the &lsquo;Times Higher Education Supplement&rsquo;,  which you can probably trust a bit more. What about the Hansard report from  this place? Maybe you can trust that even more. I found that there was a move  by the Committee for Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment to  have the decision of the Labour Government reversed. That was at a time when our  Budgets were being increased by between 6% and 8% on a regular basis as a  result of very generous spending by the Labour Party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What did the then SDLP Minister do? He refused to accept  the recommendation of the Committee and the vote of the Assembly. He said that  he could not do so because it would cost &pound;35 million and he did not have that  money in the budget. He was getting a rising contribution from Westminster, and yet he could not do that.  The SDLP&rsquo;s John Dallat, however, said that it would not matter because the  experience in the Republic was that it did not affect even the less well-off,  so they could go ahead and do it safely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That party is now attacking something that has not even  happened yet. It is putting down a marker that, if we do not find &pound;40 million  or &pound;60 million for the DEL budget, the  Assembly will have yet again failed the students of Northern Ireland. However, we know  that the SDLP did differently when it was in a similar position. We have had  that time and time again in this debate, but Ministers and parties really have  to take responsibility. Members cannot poke at other parties and say that they  should not be doing this or that simply because their party does not have the  portfolio. It appears, once again, that the SDLP &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will give way in a moment or two. I am sure that  the Member will maybe want to rejig the words that he said earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, we have  got the reduction in the block grant, and that is set against the background of  a falling budget and severe difficulties. The &pound;22&middot;1 million of savings that the  SDLP identified last night will not fill the hole for student finance let alone  all the other things that it wants to use that for. The Assembly will have to  make hard decisions. The SDLP cannot run away from that or try to rewrite  history to say that it had no responsibility for the introduction of student  fees. Neither can it simply wash its hands of the Barnett consequentials that  the Assembly faces as a result of a decision made at Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. He has made fairly serious claims about my  rewriting history and various other things. First, what his DUP colleagues,  including Mr Bell &mdash; it would not be the first time that Mr Bell got his facts  wrong in the Chamber, as I have learned very quickly &mdash; have said and what you  just repeated is that the SDLP said &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. All comments must be made through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Sorry, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Up until now, the DUP and the Minister have been  claiming that the SDLP had nothing to do, is denying &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.] </span>They are claiming that the SDLP denies that it had  anything to do with the introduction of tuition fees in the North of Ireland.  That is absolutely a historical fact. I have not rewritten any history. The  Minister quoted TES. Anyone who goes to the TES website will find that among  the challenges that, it says, Sean Farren faced when he was appointed Minister  &mdash; so, obviously, it was referring to things that happened before he became  Minister &mdash; was what to do about tuition fees and student finance in the form of  grants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Minister has not mentioned the fact that  Sean Farren was actually the Minister who reintroduced bursaries for the most  disadvantaged students in the North, but, by all accounts, amnesia is not a  crime in this Chamber. The Minister is trying to throw dirt around about  tuition fees to see where it sticks. The Minister is arguing that Sean Farren  is guilty of something. On the same terms, he is not arguing for the abolition  of all tuition fees in this Budget &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  So, what is good for the goose &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Resume your seats. The Minister gave way, so Mr Callaghan  has the Floor. The Minister cannot take the Floor back until Mr Callaghan sits  down, so Mr Callaghan has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat as a ucht sin, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I think that the  Minister of Finance and Personnel would do very well to bear in mind &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  The Minister would do well to bear in mind what has actually happened over the  past decade. When Se&aacute;n Farren and the SDLP were in charge of the university  sector here &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Should an intervention not be short,  rather than a speech to the House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have said that on a number of different occasions. I asked Mr  Callaghan to make his intervention short. However, he still has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The bigger point is that, when Se&aacute;n Farren was Minister,  there was record investment in the universities here, numbers were growing and  research was increasing. The Minister is presiding over a retrograde track in  higher education here, and he will continue to do so. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There is a good reason why interventions should be short,  and it is that we get too many interruptions. I also ask the Minister to keep  it short.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Although it did clarify the situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Yes, I am very clear after that. I know that the  Member said when he started his speech that he did not intend to promise to be  brief, because he would never make a promise that he could not keep. However,  he should apply that to his interventions as well. The one thing that I can  promise, and Members will be interested in this, is that I will not be giving  way to Mr Pol Pot any longer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I know that all sorts of things are said in the banter across the  Chamber. However, I ask Members to respect other Members by calling them by their  proper names.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We will not put it on the record anyway. It does not  matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn now to Mr Farry&rsquo;s contribution. I always enjoy  his contributions, because he usually draws very useful interventions from  other Members and then catches them out, which is always good craic. He is  always very realistic and honest in his speeches. I am not so sure whether his  party likes all the things that he says, however. Nevertheless, if people stick  their chins out and get hit, they will get used to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry talked about a number of issues, starting with his  usual point about raising revenue from the sources from which we can raise  revenue. At least he has been consistent in his theme. However, I happen to  disagree with him on that, and the Executive disagree with him. I have no doubt  that, at some stage, we will have to come to the issue of water rates. We may  well come to that through changing the governance structure of Northern Ireland  Water. Who knows? There has been a clamour towards raising water rates.  However, at this time, given the hardship that many households are facing, the  Executive have made the decision not to impose additional water charges on  people. The Member is quite right to say that we have to live with the  consequences of that, and it means that the extensive capital budget that is  required for Northern Ireland Water must come from resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let Members be clear: that is the choice that we make.  Members highlighted other capital schemes that they would like to see, such as  health centres, schools, hospitals, roads and a range of other things. However,  if we are going to invest in our water structure and meet EU requirements, the  cost of some of those schemes will go by the board. If we at least know what  the choices are, we can then make them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also talked about the protection of the Health  Service. He indicated that he felt that the protection of the economy had  somehow been compromised as a result of the protection of the Health Service.  Again, however, he at least highlighted the choice. We have given protection to  the Health Service &mdash; I want to come to that point later &mdash; in a way that has had  an impact on other people&rsquo;s budgets. That is one of the consequences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He also asked why we do not benchmark some of our services  against others. Recently, PEDU worked with the Department of Education to  identify how savings could be made. That was the first port of call: whether we  can benchmark services in education against other services, even other services  provided in Northern Ireland.  That would be a useful start. I cannot remember them all off the top of my  head, but when school meals, transport, teacher support, CCMS administration,  etc, were benchmarked, the disparities between what happens in one education  and library board and what happens in another were huge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It should not be necessary for PEDU to go in to identify  those issues in a Department. It is the kind of thing that Ministers ought to  be doing to ensure that they are getting the best value for money from the  resources that are being used. However, it has given a good base for a further  study on where efficiencies might be found in the Health Service. At least the  Education Minister co-operated on that exercise. We have not had the same co-operation  in the exercise that PEDU has tried to do with the Health Service. I have said  time and time again that PEDU should not be seen as a threat to a Department;  it should be seen as a way of helping a Department to manage its budget in  times of austerity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also talked about the opportunities for  North/South co-operation, as did other Members. I want to emphasise that I have  no difficulty with that. I have already had discussions with the Finance  Minister in the Republic. I have exchanged letters with him, and I hope that,  once we have identified the opportunities that there might be at that level,  the Departments will work on realising them. Altnagelvin Hospital  is a good example of where that co-operation can benefit everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Frew asked me to specifically address the issue of the  Presbyterian Mutual Society. I have read some of the letters that have been  sent to my Department about the Presbyterian Mutual Society, as has the  Enterprise Minister. The issue has been stirred up by some who want to use the  Presbyterian Mutual Society and the plight of the savers for their own  political advantage. They are cynically abusing and exploiting the predicament  that the savers in the Presbyterian Mutual Society find themselves in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Enterprise Minister, the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister &mdash; who could quite honestly walk away from it and say it has  nothing to do with him &mdash; have put endless hours into this. I have put that  effort in, as have previous Finance Ministers. Immense work has been put in by  officials from the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment and OFMDFM.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We believe that, finally, we have got the finance; the one  last ingredient is the contribution from the Presbyterian Church. The finance  is in place, the Enterprise Minister is drawing up a scheme, and we see the  light at the end of the tunnel. Of course, the scheme has to be accepted by the  savers in the Presbyterian Mutual Society. I believe that we are on the cusp of  getting this sorted, finally, and sorting out the situation. However, there  will always be those who would rather that we did not get it sorted out, to be  quite truthful. We have got to be very careful of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McLaughlin mentioned the consultation on the draft  Budget. He highlighted the importance of the consultation process, and I would  like to add my endorsement of that process. It has not been as lengthy as we  would have wished, but we were constrained by the fact that we did not know  what money we were going to have until 20 October. We have a coalition  Government, and all five partners had to be involved in the decisions, no  matter what the SDLP might say. It is regrettable that, having been involved,  two parties decided that they wanted to take the easy way out and simply say  that they were going to distance themselves from the draft Budget because there  are some unpleasant things in it. However, discussions went on for a long time.  We tried to reach agreement, right up to this morning. Despite the fact that  people say it has been a very short time period, there have been 1,000  responses to the consultation. Those will now be analysed and brought to the  Executive&rsquo;s Budget review group to come up with the final draft.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McLaughlin also raised the issue of tax-varying and revenue-raising  powers. I have already said that we need to be careful in that regard, but  there are other tax-varying powers. I think that the Member for South Antrim Mr  Kinahan raised the issue of Aldergrove airport and the importance of flights  and connections. The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has been in  discussion with the Treasury over the whole issue of air passenger duty and the  impact that that is likely to have, as well as other tax issues, such as the  aggregates levy and the fair fuel stabiliser.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister raised the issue of health and said that the  health budget was not sufficient. We had a good exchange on the health issue.  At least he gave way on a number of occasions. I disagree with nearly  everything that he said. He has ignored the reality. Indeed, I am still waiting  for the response. He wants &pound;200 million for health. I think that two or three  Members challenged him to say where that will come from, but he could not give  us an answer during his contribution. If he wants to give us the answer now, I  am quite happy to give way, but I suspect that he will want to sit there and  say nothing. I am sure that he will use the excuse that time is passing and he  does not have time to give me a yes or no answer or explain where the &pound;200  million might come from. That really typifies an awful lot of the criticism of  the Budget that has come from the Ulster Unionist Party. Mr Basil McCrea, who  is sitting beside him, seems to be smitten with the same disease. He can tell  you how to spend money, but he cannot tell you how to save it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hope that it is a short intervention.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I do not know why I suffer from the criticism that was made of others. In his  statement to the Northern Ireland Grand Committee, the Minister said that, as a  result of the Barnett consequentials, we have to live with those budgets. Why  does the health budget appear to fall behind that of England  and Wales?  That is where I look for clarity. Perhaps the Minister will take the  opportunity to explain why.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am more than happy to. The Member flits in and out  of the Chamber, so he probably did not have the opportunity to listen to the  words of wisdom that I gave Mr McCallister, so I will give them to him now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The health budget in Northern Ireland, over the  four-year period, will increase in real terms by 0&middot;2%. In England &mdash; he is quite  right &mdash; it will increase by 0&middot;4%, so one could argue that the Health Service in  England will do better in real terms than that in Northern Ireland. However,  the other ingredient is that the Health Service in England is expected to find  efficiencies of &pound;20 billion or 5% a year over the four years. We have not asked  the Health Minister in Northern Ireland  to find those efficiencies, which means that there has been a better budget  settlement for the Health Service in Northern   Ireland than in England. The idea that we got the  money for the Treasury from the Barnett consequentials and then took some of it  from the health budget is just not true.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No. I will not give way. I have explained it time  and again.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: If  you do not understand it by now &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not think that it is a case of not  understanding; it is just that some people are in denial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me very quickly to the next point. The SDLP and  the Ulster Unionist Party seem to believe that, somehow, this is a carve-up  between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. The leader of the SDLP said that the Budget was  &ldquo;customised&rdquo; to give the DUP benefit over its opponents, which means,  presumably, the Ulster Unionist Party. I suspect that she also meant that Sinn  F&eacute;in had the same &ldquo;customised&rdquo; Budget to give it an advantage over the SDLP.  The facts just do not back that up. The Departments that have taken the highest  cuts are DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in Departments. The highest cut went to a Sinn F&eacute;in  Department. The next highest cut went to a Sinn F&eacute;in and DUP Department: the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. The next one went to a  DUP Department, and the next went to another DUP Department.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will give way in a moment or two. Let me finish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Departments that did best &mdash; the ones that will get a  cash increase over the four years &mdash; are the two Ulster Unionist Party  Departments, the SDLP Department and one DUP Department. They are the only ones  that will get an increase in cash terms over the four-year period. I want to  put on record that the idea that, somehow or other, there was a carve-up  between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to make sure that all the hard cuts and difficult  business decisions had to be taken by the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party in  order to give us some electoral advantage is just so much rubbish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. Will the Minister reflect on those  comments, given that a leading and well-respected economist said on the radio  yesterday that the three Departments that have been hardest hit are the  Department for Employment and Learning, the Health Department and the  Department for Social Development? Furthermore, Anna Lo pointed out the cuts to  capital spend in the Department for Social Development, which will result in  fewer houses for those most in need on the housing waiting list. Ms Lo seems to  be at odds with her party colleague, who is prepared to vote for the Budget  even though he thinks that it is full of holes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not know which leading economist the lady is  talking about, but let me give her the facts, which are in the Budget document.  The sums are right, and no one has said that the calculations are wrong. Health  had a cash increase of 7&middot;58%. DEL  had a cash increase of 1&middot;86%, and all the other Departments, apart from DETI  and DSD, had a negative cash result over the four years. Those are the facts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am not going to give way. The Member had plenty of  opportunities to contribute earlier. Indeed, he slipped wrong information to  his party leader, who claimed that DCAL&rsquo;s budget had increased by 30%; whereas  Mr O&rsquo;Loan condemned me for decreasing DCAL&rsquo;s budget by 14%. Both of them cannot  be right. Who is right, and who is wrong? The facts bear it out.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The leader of the SDLP raised some other points. However,  she is not here, so, due to the lateness of the hour, I will not go through  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I liked Mr McElduff&rsquo;s honesty at least. He talked about the  savage reduction in DCAL&rsquo;s budget: the worst cut that there has been in any  Administration. Of course, when I pointed out that, in fact, the cut to DCAL&rsquo;s  budget is about half of that suffered by the Department for Culture, Media and  Sport (DCMS) in England, he said aye, but that that figure did not suit him, so  he did not bother using it<span class="Italic">. [Laughter.]</span> At least that  is one example of candour in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff raised a number of issues about the impact &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  He is obviously not a great fan of England.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: He raised the issue of Northern Ireland Screen, in  which, of course, we have invested, because we recognise the importance of the  film industry and the very high multiplier impact that investment in it has on  jobs and extra spend in Northern    Ireland. In this time of austerity, it is  good that we have been able to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have visited museums and libraries, and I understand the  difficulties that exist. However, we took a huge Barnett consequential hit as a  result of the reduction in funding to DCMS in England. We have not passed all of  that on to DCAL. Nevertheless, I accept that DCAL&rsquo;s budget has had the second  biggest decrease of all Northern    Ireland budgets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff also raised the issue of arts funding. The  Budget reflects a 7&middot;7% reduction over the four-year period. However, the arts  sector can benefit from lottery funding and, hopefully, that will help to make  up some of the gap.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Givan raised the issue of end-year flexibility for  Invest Northern Ireland.  First, I do not accept that it was possible to put in a scheme of EYF for  Invest Northern Ireland.  The monitoring round exists to deal with any unforeseen opportunities that  arise for Invest Northern Ireland.  Indeed, experience has shown that, when that has been required &mdash; the Bombardier  CSeries is a good example &mdash; funds have been made available. We will not let  jobs go just because there may not be sufficient money in the Budget. We will  always look for opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me rush on. Mr Kinahan is not here, so I will not deal  with his issues. Pat Ramsey raised the issues of education and training and the  impact that the reduction in that departmental budget would have on the  training of young people. We put a lot of emphasis on the training budget.  Indeed, the Department for Employment and Learning identified savings of &pound;2&middot;5  million, rising to &pound;5 million thereafter in the skills and industry programmes.  There was proactive work by the Department to buy in the services more cheaply  or to find other ways of doing the training. That part of the DEL budget is not the part that is under big  pressure, and I think that the Minister, who is sitting there, accepts that. Mr  Ramsey also raised the commitment to extend the Magee campus. It is estimated that  every 1,000 extra full-time students would cost &pound;8 million to support, and,  when budgets are tight, it is not always going to be possible to find that  funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I come then to Mr Brian Wilson, who is not in his place, so  I will not do that.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.] </span>I am going through  these quickly. If Members did not feel that they could stay the required length  of time, I do not think that it is proper of me to reply to the points that  they made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dawn Purvis raised the issue of the special fund for children,  as did Mr Callaghan. There were underspends on that Executive programme fund  and on other Executive programme funds over the years, and, at a time of  financial restraint, it is not prudent to put money into a fund where there has  been a consistent underspend and to ring-fence such spending. She also raised  the issue of the strategic equality impact assessment (EQIA). The EQIA has been  produced for the Programme for Government. Officials have produced it for the  draft Budget, and it is publicly available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lastly, I come to some of the comments made by Mr Basil  McCrea and Mr Callaghan. Mr Callaghan said that he would not be brief, and he  was not. He kept that part of his promise. I was surprise by some of the points  that he raised. It really went into the realms of fantasy. He talked about the  health proposals and the difficulties of the Health Service and said that he  could not contemplate voting for a Budget such as this unless it was severely  amended to deal with the problems of the Health Service. I refer him to his own  document. He is looking for hundreds of millions of pounds for the Health  Service before he is prepared to vote for the Budget. I looked at the SDLP&rsquo;s  document and its proposals for the Health Service, including extra spending to  protect front line services. He said that he could not possibly vote for the  Budget because the Health Service does not have a high enough level of  protection: how much would the SDLP have allocated to it? He wants &pound;200 million  or thereabouts, before he can bring himself to vote for this Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP document says:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;While the Party understands that reports of services  nearing collapse in certain areas may be exaggerated&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, it believes that the Budget should be  negotiated. What will it put into it? The answer is &pound;10 million in year 1; &pound;10  million in year 2; &pound;5 million in year 3; and &pound;5 million in year 4. Yet he has  the audacity to say that he could not possibly put his hand up for this Budget  because, unless I give it hundreds of millions of pounds, his party could not  possibly give it support. That is not what the SDLP said in its document.  Indeed, it said that the reports of its demise were greatly exaggerated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Callaghan went on to outline that another reason why he  would not vote for this Budget is because there are secretive funds and secret  talks with secret organisations in secret places by secret people about secret  topics that we do not know anything about. I would love to know about that  because, if the money that will go to OFMDFM is to be allocated in that way, he  would have a duty, as a public representative, to inform the House that,  somehow or other, the funds that we will vote into the Budget will be  misappropriated in some way or handed out to the favourites of either the First  Minister or deputy First Minister as a result of the secretive talks that are  going on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No, I have told the Member that I will not give way  to him. He abused it last time, and I will not let him abuse it again. He had  every opportunity to explain that. He was challenged on at least three  occasions by Mr Humphrey to tell us who the secret people are, where the secret  talks happened, what the topics were and what sums of money were talked about.  He did not tell us then, and, therefore, I suspect that we will get another set  of pathetic excuses as to why it will not be done.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I would be a bit more charitable  to Mr Callaghan than you, Minister. I think that, perhaps, we should give him  another opportunity to name those people. I am interested to know who they are,  and I think that his party colleagues in north Belfast will be interested to know who they  are. Please tell the House who those people are.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As I said, he abused his opportunity, and I will not  let him intervene again. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I really loved this one: the small traders in Londonderry are devastated by the prospect of rates  rises. Then, when I turn to page 39 of the SDLP document, under the heading  &ldquo;Finding new revenue streams&rdquo;, I see the first suggestion is to, &ldquo;Unfreeze the  regional rate&rdquo;.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.] </span>Who will the regional  rate affect? Small traders. However, the SDLP is appalled at that, and Mr  Callaghan could not possibly vote for a Budget that will hit small traders in  that way. We actually stole that idea from the SDLP document. We got it into  the Budget because the SDLP indicated that it was prepared to support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Callaghan said that he was not going to be brief, and he  was not brief. He talked himself into a bigger hole the longer he went on, and  he talked me into more of a trance the longer he went on. Anyhow, what can we  do?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by responding to Basil McCrea&rsquo;s scurrilous  allegation that somehow I am a closet Tory, that I have supported the Tory  Party and, indeed, that I welcomed the Tory cuts in the House of Commons. Mr  McCrea&rsquo;s speeches are usually brief and usually fairly lively. I will be  generous and put it down to the fact that he has a very short attention span. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I suspect that his attention span did not  stretch to reading all the Hansard report, or even the next couple of  paragraphs of the Hansard report from the Northern Ireland Grand Committee of  the House of Commons. He is absolutely right: I did say that we would not  complain about the Barnett consequentials. There is no point.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Barnett consequentials are not worked out by some  Minister who says: &ldquo;Ha ha, let&rsquo;s stick the knife into Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  The Barnett consequentials result from the fact that, when spending proposals  are made for Departments in England  and there is an equivalent line of spend in Northern Ireland, we receive a  consequence of that. It is worked out by a formula on a computer, and we cannot  fight with that. It is part of the deal that we have for determining finance in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Had the Member read on in Hansard, he would have found that  I raised the issue that we had been hit with more than our proportionate share  of cuts. Owen Paterson said that he would work for a good deal for Northern Ireland.  I made the point that he did not work for a good deal on the Barnett  consequentials because he had no control over that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, what about the &pound;316 million of EYF that was taken?  What about the investment programme of &pound;18 billion that is short by about &pound;4  billion? What about the Barnett consequentials from Olympic spending that Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland  have been denied? What about the application of the Barnett consequentials to  policing, which was not even compliant with the statement of funding? Yet, that  amounted to a &pound;23 million cut in the police budget, and it went through for the  next four years with a cut in the baseline of a further &pound;92 million? I object  to those examples of unfairness, and that is why I oppose what has been imposed  on Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that there is nothing that anyone in the Assembly  can do about the Barnett consequentials, but we have every right to be  indignant about the additional, gratuitous cuts, which reflect what David  Cameron said when he was interviewed on &lsquo;Newsnight&rsquo; before the election. He  said that he was targeting places such as Northern Ireland because there was  too much public spending there. That is the kind of policy that Mr McCrea and  his party supported.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, Mr McCrea is great at the rhetoric, but, when he  was challenged on whether he would have voted for those things in the House of  Commons, he did not reply. He is usually verbose, but he did not reply. He has  been asked where his party would impose the cuts, given that it wants more  money for health and education. Yesterday, he said that the education budget  was about &pound;200 million short, and his party said that health was &pound;200 million  short. Where will he get that &pound;400 million from? The absolute silence says it  all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is what it the debate is all about: as one of the  smaller parties, the Ulster Unionist Party knows that it can vote against the  Budget without consequence because the two bigger parties have to carry the  burden. The Alliance Party could do exactly the same without any impact, and  the Budget could go through. However, at least the Alliance Party has  recognised that, once it is in the Executive and has been fully involved in the  discussions on the Budget, it has a responsibility, and it has lived up to  that. The two other parties have a cowardly attitude and have simply decided &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me finish the point. They have simply decided  that the two big parties can carry the Budget and take the flak while they  stand back. They say that the draft Budget is not acceptable, too vague and not  transparent, and they throw all sorts of other terms at it, but never with any  substance. That appears to give a gloss of respectability to their opposition,  but it is all about the fact that they are not prepared to put their hands up  for the tough decisions because they want to be lily-white. Come the election,  they want to be like Pontius Pilate and say that the Budget has nothing to do  with them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, is it in order for the Members opposite  to yell &ldquo;cowards&rdquo; at a Member?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We expect the debate to take place in an orderly fashion. There  can be various forms of banter across the Floor, but we ask for respect to be  shown to all Members. That, by and large, is the situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thought that that would be the case. The Minister made a number of  contradictory statements. On the one hand, he said that I am normally  circumspect and to the point, and, on the other hand, he accused me of being  verbose. I want to know why he stated that he did not want to be seen as  pleading a special case for Northern    Ireland. He has just given us a lot of  rhetoric about why we should plead a special case for Northern Ireland,  and he should have said that it is unfair. The Minister should argue a special  case for Northern Ireland  because of the history. That is all that I asked for clarity on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It is not pleading a special case to ask to keep the  &pound;316 million that was allocated to Departments in Northern Ireland, which the Treasury  encouraged us not to spend recklessly and to which it promised us access in  future years. It is not pleading a special case for Northern Ireland when money is  being spent on the regeneration of the Olympic village. We should have an  entitlement to it, as should Scotland  and Wales.  For years, Barnett consequentials never applied to the police in Northern Ireland,  but suddenly last June, without any consultation, the Treasury decided that it  was taking &pound;23 million off the police budget because policing had been devolved  and a Barnett consequential was being applied. That is not pleading a special  case. It is not pleading a special case when a promise is made, but is not  lived up to, about an investment fund of &pound;18 billion. That is asking for our  entitlement, and we expect the Government to live up to it. If I believe that  we are entitled to make an argument to the Treasury, I will do it as strongly  as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will not give way. I am not going to enter into a  debate on the issue. I have answered the question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me just finish with Anna Lo&rsquo;s point about the &pound;20  million from the housing associations. We are not taking &pound;20 million from the  housing associations. It is money that they have. They have reserves well over  what is required for maintenance, and so on. Mr Farry talked about  benchmarking. When housing associations in Northern   Ireland are benchmarked with those in other parts of the United Kingdom,  they have higher levels of reserves and lower levels of borrowing. Therefore,  it is perfectly reasonable for us to argue that we pay housing associations a  lower grant per house and that they use their reserves and their borrowing  ability to build the same number of houses or more. In other words, we will get  more houses for a lower grant from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. If  the housing associations are prepared to abide by that, we should be able to  deliver the number of houses that we expect to deliver.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Minister said that he will reduce grants to the housing associations, but they  do not need to accept that. If they do not accept that, it means that we will  have less public housing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There are between 12 and 14 housing associations in Northern Ireland,  and there is competition between them. Their job is to provide social housing,  and they make their money by providing social housing and bringing in rents.  They make a surplus so they have every incentive to do the job. To date, they  have always had a substantial grant of 55% from the Housing Executive. We are  saying that they could do it on a far lower grant and still be able to provide  the same number of houses. I cannot understand why a housing association would  not want to grow its stock. Indeed, one has to consider only how they competed  and pushed up land prices for one another during the boom to understand that  they are in the market for building more houses and that that situation should  continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is proven flexibility in the system? There  is evidence that the average grant was reduced from around 70% to below 60%  over the Budget period by the SDLP&rsquo;s Ministers for Social Development, yet we  have still delivered a record number &mdash; some 2,000 &mdash; of social housing newbuild  units this year. That proves that, even when housing association grants are  reduced, there is still an incentive for them to build.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member has knowledge of the subject from his  work on the Committee for Social Development. I thank him for that explanation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I thank all Members for their contributions  to the debate, which went from being lively to sometimes being a wee bit  sleepy, then back to lively again. It has been up and down. The Bill will make  provision for the early months of 2011-12. It is important work. However, the  work of the Executive and the Assembly is not complete. Over the next few weeks,  we have got to agree and approve the revised Budget for the next four years.  That, in itself, will present many challenges. There will be calls for  additional funding from many quarters. Those calls will be deafening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan made an important point. We can have good  knockabout debates in the Assembly, but at the end of the day, as Mr Kinahan  said, after we have got past all the party politicking and point scoring &mdash; you  would not expect anything else in a debating chamber &mdash; it is important that, collectively,  we look at how, even in these constrained times, we can have a Budget that we  believe will do its best to deliver what is important for the people of  Northern Ireland. As the consultation draws to a close, I have no doubt that we  will have a challenging few weeks. I hope that Ministers will work together. We  have put in place in the Executive a structure to enable every Minister to have  his or her say. On that note, I ask the Assembly to support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that, as this  is a Budget Bill, the motion requires cross-community support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Budget Bill [NIA 11/10] be  agreed. </p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="a6" id="a6"></a>Employment (No. 2) Bill: Final  Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning &nbsp;(Mr Kennedy)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Employment (No. 2) Bill [NIA 24/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members must keep quiet when leaving the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, in the past, I have been  accused of making moving speeches. I am not sure that I have the ability to  move quite so many Members. They seem to be emptying the Chamber at high speed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next stage of the Bill is Royal Assent. I respectfully  hope that Her Majesty has not been waiting all day. Anyway, I am pleased that  the Bill has reached its Final Stage. It represents one of the key outputs of a  very comprehensive review process. I thank all those who have given their time  to contribute to what has been a thorough discourse. The provisions of the Bill  are consistent with the core principles that the consultation steering group  established at an early stage of the review. I want to put on record my  appreciation of the work of the steering group&rsquo;s members, from the  Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Federation of Small Businesses  (FSB), the Northern Ireland committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions  (NICICTU), the Equality Commission and the Labour Relations Agency (LRA) who  ensured that the public consultation secured the views and opinions of all  interested parties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth reflecting on the principles that have guided  that policy review and informed the provisions of the Bill. They are the  promotion of good employment relations that encourage competitiveness;  provision of strong employment rights; preserving citizen access to the justice  system; effective mechanisms to prevent and resolve workplace disputes;  availability of non-adversarial alternatives to the tribunal system; and an  efficient and effective tribunal system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill represents the starting point for the roll-out of  a package of legislative and non-legislative measures that are designed to  change fundamentally the way that workplace disputes in Northern Ireland  are resolved. I am conscious that the current system has created difficulties  in that too many workplace disputes end up in a tribunal, when they could have  been resolved at a much earlier stage, thus avoiding substantial financial and  human costs. I know that there is a concern from employers about the economic  difficulties created by the current system. I am also mindful of the equally  persuasive arguments about the need to protect individual employment rights.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the provisions contained in the Bill and the  other measures that are proposed address the needs of employers and employees  in an equitable way. The Bill responds to the call for a much less legalistic  approach to how grievances are raised in the workplace, through the repeal of  the statutory grievance procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to have the rapt attention of all Members, Mr  Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will Members please give the Minister proper respect?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: They are clearly engrossed in something else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Grievances in the workplace will now be resolved on the  basis of a simpler good-practice approach set out in a new Labour Relations  Agency code of practice. At the same time, the Bill preserves reasonable  minimum legal standards for disciplinary and dismissal situations in cases  where a wrong decision could put an individual&rsquo;s career at stake or place an  employer in an invidious legal position. I was struck by one of the comments  offered in evidence to the Employment and Learning Committee. A witness said  that the statutory disciplinary and dismissal procedures are good for employees  and for employers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also removes confusing links between the grievance  and disciplinary processes &mdash; I must speak to my officials again <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> &mdash; and the time limits for lodging tribunal  proceedings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Discipline them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I would, if I could get it out. Never mind &lsquo;The King&rsquo;s  Speech&rsquo;; what about the Minister&rsquo;s speech?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  This is not an Oscar-winning performance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: It certainly is not; it is too late in the night.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill affords the Labour Relations Agency complete  discretion in offering assistance to settle a dispute before it reaches a  tribunal and removes unhelpful limitations on the agency&rsquo;s duty to assist with  resolution once a tribunal claim has been lodged. It amends industrial  tribunals&rsquo; powers to reach a determination without a hearing, where the parties  give their consent, and it clarifies the tribunal&rsquo;s power to place restrictions  on publicity where sensitive matters arise during a case. The Bill reduces  unnecessary bureaucracy by providing for the enforcement of tribunal awards and  simple conciliated settlements without the need for a court order. It also  enables the Fair Employment Tribunal to hear all aspects of a case that  currently requires the needless duplication involved in convening a separate  industrial tribunal hearing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Bill introduces the legislative framework to  afford employees a new right to request time away from core work duties to  undertake training that will benefit their business. Employers will be under a  responsibility to give such requests serious consideration against a range of business  grounds. However, as my predecessor indicated, the provisions for time to train  will be commenced only when there is sustained growth in the economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Second Stage debate, the Employment and Learning  Committee has given detailed consideration to the provisions of the Bill and  has produced what I believe to be a comprehensive, thoughtful and balanced  report. I express my thanks to the Committee for its detailed scrutiny of the  Bill. I concur with the Committee&rsquo;s view that although the Bill represents an  important milestone in the movement towards a better way of resolving workplace  disputes, we must redouble our efforts to challenge the litigation culture in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has rightly noted that it expects the  Department to monitor closely new systems and ways of working and that it  wishes to see a continuing willingness to make improvements where and when  necessary or desirable. I am happy to give the Committee an assurance on all  those points. As I have said, the Bill is part of a wider change process, and  its passage today and subsequent Royal Assent will mark the commencement of the  review&rsquo;s implementation phase.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other measures being taken forward in parallel to the Bill  are promotion of an expanded and enhanced arbitration scheme as a faster,  cheaper and less stressful alternative to the legal process; an economic  appraisal to judge the merits of establishing an employment appeal tribunal;  work to provide clearer and more consistent information and advice to those  facing a dispute; exploration of options to support small businesses in  delivering their employment relations responsibilities; development of an  employment relations good practice model based on a pilot programme that is  being taken forward by my Department; and measures to enhance the capability of  managers to deal effectively with what the Chartered Institute of Personnel and  Development referred to as &ldquo;those difficult conversations with staff&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The success of the implementation phase can be judged only  over the passage of time, but I am heartened to note that a cultural shift is  needed in our approach to workplace disputes in Northern Ireland. The current  approach, with its disproportionate focus on formal process and threat of  litigation, is not in the best interests of the economy and is not the most  effective way of upholding employment rights. I assure Members that my  Department will be closely monitoring developments throughout the  implementation phase and will continue the very constructive process of stakeholder  engagement that has been the hallmark of the review. I look forward to hearing  Members&rsquo; contributions on this important Bill, and I commend it to the  Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I thank the Minister  for his explanation of the Bill. As he said, the Committee has done extensive  pre-legislative work for it in close partnership with the relevant stakeholders  and the Department. The Committee stuck to its usual practice of working in  partnership with the Department and stakeholders, and the results are plain to  be seen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee Stage of the Bill started on 22 June 2010,  and at its meeting on 30 June 2010, the Committee agreed to seek a short  extension to the Committee Stage to enable members to take further evidence. A  draft motion extending the Committee Stage to 2 December 2010 was agreed by the  Committee on 8 September and supported by the Assembly on 20 September. The  Committee ordered its report on the Bill to be printed at its meeting on 24  November 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister and his officials for adopting a  practical and sensible approach towards working with the Committee. I would  also like to place on record the work of the Committee staff before and after  the Bill&rsquo;s introduction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the pre-legislative phase, the Committee undertook  an extensive study, the object of which was to collate and consider the  opinions and views of relevant stakeholder organisations on a way forward for  workplace dispute resolution in Northern    Ireland. Based on the evidence received, and  taking on board members&rsquo; views, the Committee realised that there is a need to  develop and promote a culture of early dispute resolution as opposed to seeking  legal redress through the tribunal system as the most appropriate approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alternative dispute resolution should be promoted as the  most appropriate alternative to tribunals in order to protect the privacy of  those involved and so ensure the pursuit of a faster, flexible and more cost  effective means of settling a grievance, especially given the current economic  climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to ensure that dispute resolution is made  simpler and less bureaucratic for both employer and employee and that a revised  system does not simply replace one set of complex and confusing rules and  regulations with another that is not user-friendly. Members were mindful of  that matter. The Committee strongly believes that the provision of more  accessible information and the promotion of a clearer understanding of employer  and employee rights and obligations by all those involved are essential to the  success of any revised system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the pre-legislative phase and the Committee Stage of  the Bill, the Committee took evidence from the Department and a range of  stakeholders. The evidence shows the need to develop and promote a culture of  early dispute resolution as opposed to seeking legal redress through the  tribunal system as the most appropriate approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, there were concerns raised via the  Department&rsquo;s consultation, and the Committee&rsquo;s greatest concern is the  opposition of the Federation of Small Businesses to the time-to-train  provision. Members understand small and medium-sized enterprises&rsquo; (SMEs)  concerns about workers taking time off to train. However, reskilling and  upskilling is probably the best way for SMEs to evolve and grow. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s commitment to monitor, review and provide support and information  for SMEs. Of course, that must be readily accessible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains 18 clauses and three schedules. I will  refer to only a few of those. The Committee raised issues about the wording in  the explanatory and financial memorandum on clauses 8 and 12 regarding the  Labour Relations Agency. Members expressed concern that the wording of the  memorandum with regard to those clauses appeared to suggest prioritising the  LRA&rsquo;s work, subsequent to the movement from a duty to a power regarding the  LRA&rsquo;s capacity to conciliate pre-claims. That was brought to the attention of  the Department and officials. The indication was clear from the Department that  it was not a resource issue. That commitment is to be welcomed, and we thank  the Minister for taking that on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was also dispute between the LRA and the Department  about the resources issue stemming from the movement from a duty to a power.  LRA highlighted its opposition to clauses 8 and 12, which propose to reduce the  agency&rsquo;s capacity to conciliate pre-claims from a duty to a power. Although the  agency acknowledged the Department&rsquo;s argument that that will enable the agency  to exercise greater discretion in offering its assistance to resolve disputes,  LRA saw that as a potential resourcing issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agency currently has a specific duty to conciliate  pre-claim cases. The agency, having that duty, believes that it is on stronger  grounds in seeking additional resources to deal with any increase in pre-claim  cases, particularly with the Department and the agency actively promoting  pre-claim conciliation. The agency representative emphasised its view that  clauses 8 and 12 significantly reduced the grounds on which resources could be  secured to deal effectively with the Department&rsquo;s policy proposals on promoting  pre-claim conciliation and recommended to the Committee that clauses 8 and 12  should be withdrawn from the Bill. However, having got assurances from the  Minister and officials, the Committee agreed to allow those to continue  unamended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The officials reiterated that clauses 8 and 12 were to  provide LRA with greater flexibility to target its pre-claim conciliation  services at those disputes that had the potential to escalate to a tribunal  hearing and that were, in the opinion of the agency, amenable to early  resolution. The Department is clear that LRA&rsquo;s pre-claim conciliation service  should continue to be widely available, which is consistent with the vast  majority of the feedback from the public consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Committee&rsquo;s duty is to scrutinise the Bill as  drafted, the Bill does not mention resources. Therefore, the Committee focused  on the content of the Bill while being very aware of stakeholder concerns. The  Committee considered the issue presented by the Department and LRA and agreed  that the clauses should remain, with the caveat that the Department must  continue to monitor the resource requirements of LRA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to appeal to statutory arbitration, LRA  proposed that an appeal on the arbitrator&rsquo;s award be allowed as part of an  extended statutory arbitration scheme. The appeal would be to the industrial  court. Although the Bill extends the statutory arbitration scheme from three  jurisdictions to all relevant employment jurisdictions, it does not provide for  an appeal on the arbitrator&rsquo;s award.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agency&rsquo;s view was that an appeal against the arbitrator&rsquo;s  award on the grounds of fairness would facilitate greater use of statutory  arbitration as opposed to submitting a claim to a tribunal. The agency also  believed that the proposal to allow an appeal to the industrial court provided  for a non-adversarial means of coming to a resolution. That is fully in line  with the principles of the Department for Employment and Learning review in  relying on legal remedies only as a last resort.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department emphasised that arbitration was not, and was  not intended to be, a process focused on the legal merits of a case. Rather, it  offered a quick, less formal and non-legalistic alternative to the legal  process, and, as such, an appeal could detract from the benefits of that  process, namely, an efficient consideration of a case that brought closure to  an employment dispute. The Committee was satisfied with the Department&rsquo;s  arguments and its undertaking to keep the effectiveness of the scheme under  review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to providing for primacy of alternative dispute  resolution. In its briefing to the Committee, LRA pointed out that when parties  were unable to resolve a workplace problem in New Zealand and the matter was  referred to the employment relations authority for a decision, the authority  must first consider whether an attempt was made to resolve the matter by  mediation. The authority can direct that mediation or further mediation is used  before a case is dealt with unless such direction would mitigate the resolution  of a case. The agency put forward the view that tribunals in Northern Ireland  should be empowered to ask, at the case management stage, whether alternative  dispute resolution was used and, if not, to ask the reason for not having used  alternative dispute resolution. In response, the Department indicated that it  had sought stakeholders&rsquo; views at the pre-consultation and consultation stages  of the policy review on the possible introduction of mandatory mediation or, as  a less radical step, some form of incentivised alternative dispute resolution  (ADR). Officials suggested that stakeholder opinion was divided on that issue  and that the Department had to consider the respective merits of a voluntary  approach and a mandatory regime for ADR in reaching a final policy decision.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department indicated that ADR is intended to offer an  alternative to the tribunal system and is not supposed to be perceived as a  compulsory process that parties in dispute must go through before accessing the  justice system if a legal determination is required. The Department indicated  that it was not persuaded that a specific provision to require parties to  engage in ADR was an appropriate way forward. Again, the Committee considered  both sets of arguments and was satisfied with the Department&rsquo;s assessment that  a cultural change is required to create a shift towards ADR and that the  imposition of a compulsory imperative is not the best way forward. However, the  Committee also expects the Department to keep that position under review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to confidentiality, in their briefing to the  Committee, the agency representatives highlighted that LRA staff and  arbitrators have statutory protection in respect of the confidentiality of  certain ADR processes, including being compelled to be witnesses at tribunal  proceedings. The agency welcomed confirmation of that by the Department and  welcomed the fact that the Department is pursuing the same confidentiality  protections for all agency ADR activity. Representatives stated LRA&rsquo;s view that  the widening of such protections to all ADR activity is a vital element in  sustaining the credibility of the agency&rsquo;s ADR services. They said that, should  that not be achieved, the Department&rsquo;s objective to promote the early  resolution of workplace disputes might be compromised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In its response to LRA, the Department defined those  statutory protections. The Department stated that it has received legal advice  confirming that the conciliation and wider ADR activities undertaken by the  staff of the agency, or persons acting as agents on LRA&rsquo;s behalf, are protected  by confidentiality provisions in existing legislation. Anything communicated to  them during the course of ADR will not be admissible in evidence before an  industrial tribunal, save with the consent of the person who communicated the  information to the agency. For the Department, that position represents the  core focus of LRA&rsquo;s ADR activity. The agency, however, is seeking an extension  of the confidentiality provisions to cover non-core ADR activity where none of  the specified employment rights jurisdictions are engaged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agency has concerns that, at a later stage, following  the completion of ADR that falls outside the core area of work, tribunal  proceedings may be initiated and the agency&rsquo;s staff may be called upon to give  evidence at a tribunal. The Department has advised LRA that it would need to  specify the nature and limits of the required protection before it could  contemplate drafting any instructions. Again, the Committee is persuaded by the  Department&rsquo;s reassurances and willingness to continue dialogue with LRA on that  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of resources, LRA representatives highlighted  to the Committee that, in 2009-2010, the agency received 16,318 individual  rights claims, of which 9,140 were NICS sex-discrimination and equal-pay  claims, and dealt with 53,871 helpline enquires. They stressed that the  agency&rsquo;s resources continue to be pressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has acknowledged that the recession will  pose significant challenges and that all parts of the public sector will need  to be prudent in the use of existing resources and be innovative in delivering  on core business. The officials indicated that they are not in a position to  comment on the implications of the CSR for all the Department&rsquo;s spending commitments,  including the LRA, but argued that the Bill is a clear testimony to the  importance that the Department attributes to the work of the LRA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee accepts the Department&rsquo;s reassurances.  Members believe that the Bill represents a first step in the reform of  workplace dispute resolution and expect the Department to continue talking to  stakeholders and monitoring how systems are coping with the refocus on  pre-claim conciliation. The Committee approves the Bill on the basis that work  in that area of employment law is ongoing. On behalf of the Committee, I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  As the Minister has noted, and judging by the attendance in the House, the  Employment (No. 2) Bill seems to lack the controversy and hot air of some of  the other debates that we have had today. Nonetheless, it has the key  ingredients for good legislation: a responsive Minister, an attentive Committee  and diligent officials who ensured that the Bill was widely consulted on and  scrutinised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As colleagues mentioned, the key findings of the  consultation were the need to provide employers and employees with a clearer  understanding of their rights and responsibilities and the need to develop a  less bureaucratic system and a culture of early dispute resolution, which will also  help us to improve how industrial and fair employment tribunals are used. I  welcome the improvements that the Bill will make to that important area of  employment law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I also note the concerns that were raised with the  Federation of Small Businesses. That body represents the small and medium-sized  enterprises in our community, which provide the foundation for our economy. It  called for provisions to introduce a new right for employees to request  reasonable time off work for training. With careful monitoring and appropriate  support for SMEs, the time taken to reskill and upskill workers will be a  positive rather than a negative for the development and growth of individuals  and businesses. If we are to provide a workforce with the new skills that they  need to make Northern    Ireland capable of competing in a global  economy, it is vital that we raise employees&rsquo; awareness of training  opportunities and encourage employers to invest in training. I welcome the fact  that the Department will keep the fairness and effectiveness of that aspect of  the Bill under review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although work must be done to develop a robust culture of  early dispute resolution in Northern    Ireland, it is important to recognise the  Bill as a step in the right direction. It is also important to note that best  practice employment law will require adequate resourcing. As mentioned, in  2009-2010, the Labour Relations Agency received more than 16,000 individual  claims and dealt with 53,000-plus helpline enquiries. Although the agency will  need to make efficiency savings like everyone else, it is important that it has  adequate resources to deal with the important work that it does and that level  of enquiries. Of course, it will have to use those resources effectively to  deliver improved and more cost-efficient workplace dispute resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I hope that the Bill will provide greater  clarity for employers and employees, which will lead to the early resolution of  disputes and the creation of positive workplaces that are fit to contribute to  a productive and competitive local economy. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am conscious that, as Mr Lyttle indicated,  Members have had a long day. Nevertheless, the Bill is important legislation  that proves the worth of this devolved Administration. Therefore, it is right  that we give it proper consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mrs D Kelly and Mr Lyttle for their contributions  to the debate. Before I respond to specific points, I remind Members that the  Bill seeks to deliver a set of core principles, which I outlined in my opening  remarks and which were the product of a positive engagement with stakeholders.  I encourage Members not to view the Bill in isolation, but as an important part  of a wider set of legislative and non-legislative initiatives intended to  deliver real improvements to the way in which disputes are handled in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that colleagues in the Department for Business,  Innovation and Skills in Great    Britain recently launched a consultation on  further enhancements to its dispute resolution systems &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]  &mdash; </span>I hope that that conversation is as interesting as it seems, because  it seems fascinating.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Happily, I do not believe that the GB proposals cut across  any of the provisions in this Bill, and my Department will monitor closely the  outworkings of that consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I turn to the issues raised by Mrs D  Kelly and Mr Lyttle. I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for her  comprehensive and positive report to the House. The Committee made a  significant contribution to the development and scrutiny of the provisions, and  I thank all Committee members for their support and due diligence. Members will  not be surprised to hear that I agree with the Committee&rsquo;s view that we need to  reduce the bureaucracy that is associated with the resolution of disputes and  make the process more solution-orientated for employers and employees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill and the initiatives associated with it, including  the need highlighted by the Committee for improved information and guidance,  are intended to achieve that objective. I take on board the concerns expressed  by Mr Lyttle. He mentioned the Federation of Small Businesses. We are not  seeking to impose undue costs or regulations on businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee rightly highlighted the concerns expressed by  the Labour Relations Agency about the motivations behind clauses 8 and 12. I  confirm that those provisions have been designed exclusively to provide the  agency with greater flexibility to target its pre-claim conciliation services.  The volume of pre-claim cases handled by the agency is already increasing year  on year, which is encouraging, and I hope that that trend will continue  following the passage of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions of the Bill are focused exclusively on  effectiveness measures and not on cost reduction. I am clear that LRA&rsquo;s  pre-claim conciliation services should continue to be widely available because  that has been the clear message that the Department received throughout what  has been a very extensive and meaningful consultation. It is important to  remember that the Department&rsquo;s policy review has at all times been focused on  the improvement of systems for dealing with workplace disputes in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review has never been about making efficiency savings.  That said, we cannot fail to recognise the challenges posed by the present  economic situation. All parts of the public sector have a responsibility to be  prudent in the use of existing resources and to be innovative as to how they  deliver essential public services during what will be a very challenging CSR  period. We will continue to work with the Labour Relations Agency to ensure  that it is appropriately resourced, while recognising the very difficult  current public spending context. That more flexible approach mirrors  developments in the rest of the United    Kingdom, where the Employment Act 2008  replaced ACAS&rsquo;s duty to conciliate on pre-claim disputes with the same  discretionary power that is provided for in clauses 8 and 12.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the Committee&rsquo;s concern about the wording of  the explanatory and financial memorandum in relation to clauses 8 and 12. I  confirm that when the explanatory material issues with the enacted legislation,  it will reflect the revised wording that has been agreed with the Committee.  With regard to confidentiality, I assure Members that the wider alternative  dispute resolution activities undertaken by the staff of the agency or persons  acting as agents on LRA&rsquo;s behalf are protected by confidentiality provisions in  the existing legislation. Anything communicated to them during the course of  ADR will not be admissible in evidence before a tribunal unless the person who  communicated the information to the agency gives consent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns have been raised about conciliation activity  outside the statutory regime; for example, relationship mediation. The  Department explored with the agency whether there were ways of protecting  specific activities, but no adequate proposal emerged from those  considerations. However, if a need for additional protections is established,  my Department will take whatever measures are required. The great majority of  work undertaken by the agency is already protected, and I am confident that a  tribunal would carefully consider any decision to require a professional  mediator to disclose information that had been communicated in confidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of LRA arbitration, the current statutory  arrangements provide for appeal on grounds of breach of human rights or EU  obligations, as well as on grounds of fundamental perversion of the procedure.  Appeals are heard by the Court of Appeal. I believe that those grounds remain  appropriate under expanded arbitration arrangements. Arbitration can only be  available where both parties agree, so there is no question of eroding rights  to access to the justice system. Arbitration is not a process focused on the  legal merits of a case; rather, it offers a quick, less formal and less  stressful alternative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The integrity of arbitration would be compromised if it just  becomes a staging post on the way to a tribunal hearing. The broader appeal  would compromise the well-established principle that the decision of an  arbitrator is binding. I am, however, willing to offer an assurance that my  Department will monitor the effectiveness of the new scheme. I do not rule out  the possibility of future changes to the scope of the appeal function if there  is still not a sufficient uptake of arbitration.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to another issue raised by the Committee. There has  been considerable debate during the review process on the broader issue of  whether ADR should, in some way, be a mandatory process. No consensus emerged,  but there is certainly a strong feeling in some quarters that, where parties  are required to participate in ADR, it will devalue the process. Active  promotion of ADR is a much more appropriate way forward. Parties are likely to  avail themselves of ADR if it is clear to them that the process is  comparatively informal, non-legalistic and voluntary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of time to train, I want to assure the House  that those provisions will only be commenced when the economy is in a much  healthier state. We all understand the value of investing in our workforce, but  it is my view that this is not the time to introduce this new right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill before us this evening is the result of a very  positive engagement across the whole stakeholder community. Employer  organisations, trade unions, legal practitioners, HR professionals and  representatives from the statutory, voluntary and advisory sectors have all  valuably contributed to the debate. To their very great credit, all the  stakeholders have consistently thought of the bigger picture, recognising the  opportunity that devolved government offers to develop regional solutions that  respond to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  specific needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I once again commend the work of the Employment and  Learning Committee, which has been very actively engaged with the policy  development process from the very outset. I assure Members that my officials  will keep the Committee updated as the implementation of the dispute resolution  review is rolled out, and I very much hope that members will now lend their  support to the passage of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Employment (No. 2) Bill [NIA 24/09] do now  pass.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="a7" id="a7"></a>Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following motion stood in the Order Paper:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;That the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill [NIA 5/09] do  now pass.&rdquo; . &mdash; [The Minister of the Environment (Mr Poots).]</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion not moved.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="a8" id="a8"></a>Local Government Finance Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Local Government Finance Bill [NIA 14/09] do  now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I welcome the fact that this important Bill has now  reached its Final Stage, and I take this opportunity to thank the Chairperson,  the Environment Committee and all the Members who contributed to the Bill  throughout the process and assisted us in improving and refining it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not get into too much detail this evening, because  brevity is key and less is more. The Bill will consolidate into one Act the  legislative framework for local government finance. Part 1 of the Bill will  allow councils more freedom to manage their financial affairs in line with modern  accounting practices. It is important that councils have more control over  their financial affairs in anticipation of the new powers that will be  transferred to them and a stronger system of local government that can take on  the challenges of the twenty-first century and the opportunities that exist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 of the Bill updates the current provisions for  payment of grants to councils by Departments. The two elements making up a  general grant are to be replaced with two new grants: the derating grant and the  rates support grant. The statutory formula for calculating the amount payable  has not been altered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">New provisions have been made to extend all Departments&rsquo;  general powers to pay grants directly to councils. That addresses audit  concerns that, in the past, my Department was paying out grants in relation to  policies outside of its remit and over which it could not exercise sufficient  control. Extending the power to pay grants to all Departments will also remove  a layer of bureaucracy, which we always want to do, create time savings and  reduce administrative costs. That will be particularly welcome at a time when  we all face departmental budgetary pressures and constraints.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 of the Bill will update the legislative framework  for councillors&rsquo; remuneration, allowing my Department, through regulations, to  require councils to make and to publish schemes of allowances paid to  councillors. Many councils already publish that information, but the Bill will  provide a statutory basis for doing so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland is the only devolved Administration  where there is no independent panel to consider and to advise the Minister on  the systems of allowances paid to councillors. That will no longer be the case.  Clause 35 will enable my Department to make regulations to establish an  independent remuneration panel and to make those regulations for the membership  and functions of the panel.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the Bill is sound and effective. It has come  about as a consequence of the excellent relationship and spirit of co-operation  that exists between my Department and the Committee. I thank the Committee for  its assistance. The Committee proposed one amendment at Consideration Stage,  which I did not agree with. However, it was agreed, and I accepted that  outcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Bill will strengthen councils by giving  them more freedom to manage their financial affairs in line with modern  accounting practices. It will streamline the process for paying grants to  councils, make provisions for an independent remuneration panel and allow for  the publication of schemes of allowances. It will promote impartiality and  transparency in all payments to councillors. I commend the Local Government  Finance Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. If you will indulge me, I will try to wind up between now  and midnight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for the Environment, I welcome  the Final Stage of the Local Government Finance Bill. Those of us who are or  have been councillors will know that legislation relating to local government  finances and the remuneration of councillors was in need of updating. Although  quite technical in detail and perhaps not the type of legislation that grabs  headlines, the Bill should give confidence to the public, as it does to the  Committee, that the framework for overseeing local government finances is  consolidated into one piece of updated legislation to reflect modern accounting  practices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the financial circumstances that we are in, everyone  is being asked to make sacrifices. It is, therefore, important that the  framework for ensuring that public moneys are properly managed is appropriate.  As a starting point, it is necessary to ensure that the governing legislative  framework is fit for purpose. It was the Committee&rsquo;s role to scrutinise the  Bill to make sure that that was the case. In general terms, the Bill will give  councils greater freedom to manage their financial affairs. I think that that  will be welcome in an era in which, rightly, there is considerably more  scrutiny of how public funds are managed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the Committee&rsquo;s considerations, it sought views from  a range of organisations to get a balanced overview of the issues. The  Committee was greatly aided by the insight that oral and written submissions  gave. On behalf of the Committee, I thank all those who took the time to engage  with us on the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is always difficult to distil a range of views into a  single agreed position, but I think that the Committee&rsquo;s approach at least  allowed those views to be aired and raised with the Department. It is the  Committee&rsquo;s opinion, therefore, that the Bill reflects, as far as possible, the  concerns of those whom we engaged with and highlights the advantages of working  closely with the Department to exchange views and to amend legislation as  necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During clause-by-clause scrutiny, we considered one  Committee amendment and a couple that the Department proposed in response to  Committee recommendations. However, the large majority of the clauses were  agreed as drafted. In fact, in its report on the Bill, the Committee made five  recommendations, two of which the Department accepted, making the necessary  amendments so that the Committee&rsquo;s concerns would be addressed. The Committee was  also concerned about the robustness of the audit process. However, it  recognised that it would not be appropriate to legislate on the audit process  through the Bill and recommended that that process be reviewed and, if  necessary, strengthened. I would welcome a commitment from the Minister that he  will direct his Department to take that forward with some urgency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ring-fencing of the in-year rate support grant was  another of the Committee&rsquo;s key concerns. That was important to the Committee,  because members felt it unfair that the councils under the most financial  pressure could have their budgets altered in a financial year with no option  for recouping the loss. I am glad that the House supported the Committee&rsquo;s view  on that. The Committee initially wanted the Bill to allow for the inclusion of  social clauses in public procurement contracts but, on advice, it was satisfied  that those are being brought forward through subordinate legislation. We hope  that that subordinate legislation will progress quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the work that my fellow Committee members  have put into considering the legislation. We have had our fair share of  legislation, and members have approached each Bill with a judicious eye. I and  the Committee acknowledge the support provided by the Committee staff, and we  thank them for that. I also acknowledge the collaborative approach taken by the  Department and the Committee, which ensured that the Committee&rsquo;s concerns were  addressed to its satisfaction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I endorse the Bill on behalf of the  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Everyone will be pleased to hear that I will be brief. I welcome the Bill and  the fact that there will be a new legal framework in place that gives councils  greater freedom. There is a mass of more work that I will not go into in great  detail. The Committee, which I only joined halfway through its consideration of  the Bill, has done a mass of good work. Councils will thrive on this  legislation, and they need to because there is a mass of challenges coming  their way. I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the Bill with a degree of  qualification, given where we are with the process. I welcome greater freedom  for local government finance and, indeed, for local authorities&rsquo; exercising of  those powers. However, the Local Government Finance Bill is very much linked to  the review of public administration. We already have the cart before the horse  situation that is the Planning Bill going through. It is undergoing the  intensive scrutiny of the Committee for the Environment even though we do not  have the proper framework and context for it through the changes to and reform  of local government, with safeguards built in. Those safeguards will be  crucial. Although I welcome freedom on one level, it is crucial that that  freedom be balanced with openness, transparency and equality for all.  Therefore, the reform of local government will be key to how the powers are  exercised, whether they be finance, planning or any other powers that may be  handed over to the local authorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make one more very important point. Although we are  saying that there should be greater financial freedom for local authorities, it  is crucial that the transfer to local authorities of any powers that are tied  in with the review of public administration, including planning, as the  Minister will appreciate, be done in a cost-neutral way. That has proven a bit  of an issue to date. The closer that we come to a Budget, the more difficult it  is to get any degree of assured clarity from the Department in the form of an  undertaking that the transfer of powers will not be done at additional cost to  ratepayers or councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee that scrutinised the Bill and  has seen it through, I welcome it, albeit with the qualification attached that  it must be in the context of greater reform of local government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions. Mr Boylan, the  Committee Chairperson, asked a question about the audit process. As I indicated  at Consideration Stage, the audit procedures need to be effective, efficient,  understandable and subject to regular review. In that context, I am very happy  for my Department to carry out a review of the audit process. If we identify that  changes are required, we will set about making those changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Kinahan for his comments. Mr McGlone raised the  issue of the RPA. A good, prudential regime for councils is relevant  irrespective of the RPA. If the RPA had not been thought about or devised, this  Bill would still be necessary. The Bill does, however, put us in a better place  for the RPA. I have already indicated that my Department is looking to transfer  powers that have a cost-neutral impact on local authorities. I trust that that  would be the case for the Member&rsquo;s own Minister, who will have to transfer the  powers for urban regeneration to local government.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will give way in a moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to those powers being transferred to local  government, and perhaps urban regeneration may well then receive some  beneficial grant aid that will assist towns across Northern   Ireland and not just the cities of Belfast  and Londonderry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way and for his co-operation throughout the  passage of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of cost-neutrality, I asked the Minister&rsquo;s  permanent secretary whether he could give assurances that the transfer of any  powers, including planning powers, to local authorities would be done on a  cost-neutral basis. I asked that during the discussions about and presentation  of the draft Budget to the Environment Committee. The permanent secretary could  not give any such assurances. So, the fact that assurances could not be given  by the permanent secretary about cost-neutrality during the transition and the  handover of powers led to some distilling of the assurances that were given  previously. That is by way of information to the Minister about what happened  at the Environment Committee about three weeks ago.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for his kindness in drawing that matter  to my attention. Of course, we have a devolved Administration in which  Ministers and the House call the shots and where the civil servants carry out  the instructions that are given to them by the democratic institution. That is  correct and it is the way forward in this country, and I say that with the  greatest respect to my permanent secretary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I regularly hear Members criticising me because, for  example, we have reduced the number of planners. That is a difficult decision  to make, but it must be done in order to do what the Member is requesting,  which is to ensure that we have the Planning Service in a position in which it  can be transferred to councils on a cost-neutral basis. That is why we are  readdressing the issue of planning fees. We will be driving through  efficiencies in the Planning Service, we will have a fees regime that is  commensurate with the work involved around applications, and we want to put the  Planning Service on a proper footing to enable it to be transferred to local  authorities at the appropriate time. It is my aim to do that in a way that is  cost-neutral to local government. I am sure that the Minister for Regional  Development and the Minister for Social Development will also want to transfer  their powers to local government on a cost-neutral basis. We want local  government to take on the new powers in a way that is beneficial to the  community and not as a sneaky way for this Administration to pass taxes to the  community that will have to be raised through the rates revenue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that a lot of that is irrelevant to the piece of  legislation that we have before us tonight. However, I feel duty-bound to  respond to Mr McGlone&rsquo;s comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank everyone who helped to bring us to this point. I  commend the Bill to the House and welcome its support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Local Government Finance Bill [NIA 14/09] do now  pass.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a9" id="a9"></a>Private Members' Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Caravans Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Caravans Bill [NIA 17/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am delighted that the Bill has reached its Final  Stage and is on track to become the first private Member&rsquo;s Bill in the history  of this Assembly to be passed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  congratulate Mr McCallister on being the first Member to reach the Final Stage  of a private Member&rsquo;s Bill in the Assembly. Is he aware that this is only the  second private Member&rsquo;s Bill in the history of Northern Ireland government? The  first one became the Wild Birds Protection Act (Northern Ireland) 1931.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for that. She has certainly been looking into the  history books. I cannot see any Members who would have been around in 1931, not  even Pat Ramsey.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I introduced the Bill to the Assembly on 26 April  2010, I was of the firm opinion that the debate and discussions at Second Stage  and Committee Stage would be extremely productive and would help to shape the  Bill into what will, I believe, be highly effective legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now touch on the Bill&rsquo;s main purpose and aims. The  Caravans Bill provides a high level of protection for the owners of permanent  caravans, which is important because such caravans are their main or only  residence. It also provides a level of protection that did not previously exist  in Northern Ireland  for the owners of static holiday caravans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 1 provides a detailed statutory framework for  protecting the rights of residential caravan owners who live on approved sites.  That framework centres on the requirement for written agreements to be in place  between site owners and caravan owners, for a series of detailed terms to be  applied in any agreements and for the courts to have the authority to hear a  range matters relating to residential agreements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The holiday caravan sector is dealt with in Part 2.  Although it has been acknowledged that a considerable body of consumer  protection law already applies to that sector, many holiday caravan owners do  not have written agreements with site owners. Historically, that has made it  difficult to ensure the effective enforcement of existing law. The requirement  in Part 2 for written agreements that set out expressed terms of agreement will  address that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 gives protection from harassment and unlawful  eviction to those who own or rent a residential caravan on an approved site. It  is designed to protect the rights of residential caravan occupiers peacefully  to enjoy their homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 updates the definition of a caravan in line with the  definition used in England  and Wales.  That is important to provide clarity and to help to ensure the effective  application of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Second Stage debate all those months ago managed to  stir the emotions of even the most passive Members &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Speaking of which &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  First, I refute the accusation that I was present for the passing of the Wild  Birds Protection Act (Northern    Ireland) 1931. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>I may rapidly be becoming the Father of the House, but that does not  mean that I am the oldest Member, just the longest serving. However, I know  that I was in the House before the Member was born.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that the Bill raised passions, which it  did. I was one of those who vented some of those passions at the Second Stage  debate. I hope and pray that he will never use this against me in the local  press, but I would like to congratulate him on his success in bringing the Bill  through. It will forever be known as the McCallister Bill. However, I suspect  that he had some expert advice behind the scenes, and I think that that person  should also be congratulated. I see the Bill as a major step forward in  protecting the rights of caravan owners and occupiers, particularly in my and  his constituency of South Down. I have had my ear burned about this issue on  many occasions in places such as Cranfield, Annalong and Newcastle, and even Strangford. So, the Bill  is an advance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the Member had to make some concessions  along the way to make the Bill viable. However, hopefully, it will ensure that  people who enter some caravan sites do not sign away all human rights in  respect of what they can do with their caravan, to whom they can sell it, who  they can get to maintain and insure it, and who they can get to buy it back  when they no longer require it. The Member and I know that many difficult  issues have arisen. However, this is a step in the right direction. I congratulate  him, but I pray that he never lets the public of South Down know that I have  done so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to my colleague from the South Down constituency. I know that he  feels passionate about the issue, and he certainly gave me a fairly difficult  time at Second Stage. However, that is what has helped to shape the Bill. I  will, of course, try to leak the Hansard report of this debate to as many local  papers as possible, particularly given how close we are to an election.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  On behalf of caravanners across Belfast,  I thank the Member for bringing his Bill to a successful conclusion. The Member  may be aware that Millisle in my constituency of North Down is known as  &ldquo;Shankill by the sea&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Many of those people who had difficulties getting  rid of their caravans by selling them on will be delighted with the progression  of the Bill. I thank the Member and those who worked behind the scenes in  bringing this to successful fruition.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Bill is very much about constituents such as the Member&rsquo;s who travel out of  Belfast and  visit the very beautiful constituencies around it, such as Strangford, North  Down and South Down.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Newry and Armagh.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  And the very scenic Newry and Armagh. Although  I am not sure that I have ever holidayed in Bessbrook.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout this process, I have been very encouraged by the  support that the Bill has received from all sides of the House. There has been  widespread acceptance of the principles of the legislation, and the detailed  scrutiny that the Bill received in the Committee for Social Development added  to it. The Second Stage debate certainly added to and greatly informed my  thinking about where Members were on the issue. I am grateful to the Committee,  under Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s chairmanship, which gave the Bill great scrutiny and helped  to improve the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was quite clear to me from the outset that the Bill&rsquo;s  provisions for the residential caravan sector were supported almost universally  around the House, with no major contentious issues around that. The holiday  sector is the larger of the two caravan sectors here in Northern Ireland.  It was the subject of many complaints and was the most hotly contested issue  during the debate. That issue was probably the most difficult on which to get  agreement on the best outcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Wells mentioned, the current draft of the Bill looks  rather different from the original draft. When I started work on the Bill, we  had to consult, come back, redraft and look at it again. A lot of work and  effort was put in to trying to strike a balance between what needed to be a  workable piece of legislation for the holiday sector, a meaningful piece of  legislation, something that did not over-regulate the industry and something  that met Minister Foster&rsquo;s requirement that it not be overburdensome.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I add my personal congratulations to the Member on achieving the significant  milestone of bringing a private Member&rsquo;s Bill to successful fruition in the  Assembly. John McCallister deserves enormous credit, because he has taken on  board and listened to the concerns of Committee members and other political  representatives and, indeed, to ministerial concerns. I take great satisfaction  that John, who has brought the Bill successfully through the House, is a party  colleague. He very carefully steered the Bill with great wisdom, which deserves  enormous credit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also take comfort from the fact that the initial basis  for John&rsquo;s taking the Bill through the Assembly was a public meeting in  Tandragee, in my constituency of Newry and Armagh, at which a number of caravan  owners came together to raise issues of concern with John and other elected  representatives. It is timely and right that we pay due tribute to those people  who made that initial effort, and to John himself for the hard work that he has  persevered with. Congratulations, John.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to my colleague Mr Kennedy for that. I was indeed in Tandragee. I  think that I was only filling in that night because he could not go, and I got  stuck with all the work. Mr Kennedy enjoys an enormous majority in his seat in  Newry and Armagh, but I got stuck with having  to draft the Bill. However, I appreciate his support and that of party  colleagues. As Mr Kennedy highlighted, the Bill demonstrates to people across Northern Ireland that, when they identify  something that is not right, they can lobby elected Members and change the law  in Northern Ireland.  That is what politics is and should be about.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill represents a huge step forward and pushes Northern Ireland ahead of the rest of the UK. The merits  of written agreements cannot be overstated. It is almost impossible to  challenge something that a site owner is trying to impose on a caravan owner if  there is no written agreement and no transparency. There can be no nasty  surprises if there is a written agreement. Moreover, seasonal caravan owners  are being given the same statutory rights as their permanent residential  counterparts to form recognised associations and to be consulted on important  matters that may affect them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  There is no doubt that the Bill will now go for Royal Assent. Her Majesty will  read it with great interest, wonder who John McCallister is, and find out about  more about the Member for South Down. I think that most caravan site owners  will wonder when the Bill will become law. We are coming into another holiday  season, and none of us wants to see a perpetuation of the sometimes ridiculous  behaviour of some caravan site owners. Should the House agree tonight, which I  think likely, and should Her Majesty decide not to refuse to sign the  legislation, when does Mr McCallister expect that we will see the legislation  affecting an ordinary person with a site in Cranfield, Dundrum or Newcastle,  for example?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have, of course, offered to take the Bill to Her Majesty personally, but  Danny has an important Employment Bill that he says will go in first.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My understanding is that the normal process is for Royal  Assent to take four to six weeks, with the Bill being enacted six months after  that date. We are probably looking at late September or early October before it  will take effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the hour is late, but I want to record my  thanks to the Committee for Social Development, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment and the Committee for the Environment. I especially thank the  Committee for Social Development as it had the heavy lifting to do on this. I  am sure that the Chairperson of the Committee will pass on my thanks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would especially like to single out Minister Attwood and  his predecessor, Margaret Ritchie. When we initially drafted the Bill, Minister  Ritchie, as she was at the time, very helpfully wanted to redraft and change  things. She helped to facilitate that and to push the case for the legislation  through OFMDFM, so I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Margaret Ritchie and Alex  Attwood for running with the Bill. I believe that the Second Stage debate was  held on Alex Attwood&rsquo;s first day as Minister, so he did not get much of an easy  run into his portfolio.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank Minister Poots, as Part 4 of the Bill relates  to the Department of the Environment, and Minister Arlene Foster, who has been  very useful in steering and debating some of the issues around better  regulation. She has been working and showing flexibility and compromise on some  issues that we did not always agree on initially. I think it is important to  record that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also grateful to Annette Holden, who works with me and  who has had to travel around a good bit of Northern Ireland, visiting,  listening to and consulting with caravan owners and site owners to build and  shape the Bill into what it has become. I feel that that has been a very  important part of the exercise. It has been three years and one month since the  meeting in Tandragee that Mr Kennedy referred to, and we have had many ups and  downs on this.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Civil servants often get somewhat bad press in Northern Ireland,  as if they are not up to speed. I hope that the Minister will pass this on to  his officials, particularly Stephen Martin: they were absolutely superb in  their professionalism and the way in which they dealt with the issues with the  Committee and me. They have been an example of how the Assembly can work at its  best by shaping legislation, getting a policy idea and progressing, shaping and  changing it, working with the Committee, listening to Members and building on  that as we go forward. I thank Members for their support in doing that and  getting the Bill to this stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I thought that I had  been temporarily demoted or that something had been taken off me at some stage.  I join in the gushing praise of the Member. Perhaps a group hug or something  would be appropriate. I congratulate him on his tenacity in ensuring that the  Bill has got to this stage. It was a lengthy process. It seems like an eternity  since he first spoke to me about the Bill. It has been a rollercoaster going up  and down since then. It has been a complex Bill. It was complicated by the  interventions of some, and he will know that there were stages, even though  there were the best of intentions at the heart of the Bill, at which  complications and roadblocks made it look like it might not get to this stage.  I congratulate him for seeing those through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also congratulate and thank everyone who gave evidence to  the Social Development Committee. That evidence, from whatever source,  certainly helped us to have a much more robust and thorough Committee Stage.  The scrutiny of the Bill is evident in the final product and the debates that  we had at previous stages. I echo the comments that were made by the Bill&rsquo;s  sponsor in congratulating the officials from the Department, who greatly  assisted and were always at hand whenever the Committee had queries, and we had  many queries during the Committee Stage. I put on record my thanks to them and  to the staff of the Committee for their help in allowing the evidence to be  taken and the Bill report to be produced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go into the same detail as the Member. There is  a lot in the Bill, but I principally welcome the protections that are afforded  to people who live in caravans in the residential sector, some of which are  located in my constituency, and also those in the holiday sector. Members will  know that the Strangford constituency has one of the highest caravan  populations in the whole of Northern    Ireland, so it is good to see a Bill coming  through that not only protects people but protects those who holiday in our  areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps a perception has developed that caravan site owners  are somehow the enemy and are all nasty, awful people. There is certainly some  bad behaviour, and there are long lists of stories that many Members can recite  to back that up. Principally, however, the sector is enjoyed by many thousands  of people across Northern    Ireland every year without complaint at all.  It is an important aspect of our tourism industry, and it is worth putting on  record our thanks to that sector for its co-operation in allowing the Bill to  pass. The provisions in the Bill strengthen the sector considerably and make it  much more attractive. It will thrive and flourish as a result.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, on behalf of the Social Development  Committee, I congratulate the Member and thank him for his tenacity in bringing  forward the Bill. We look forward to its passing and having a positive impact  on caravan owners in the residential and holiday sectors in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  It was not my intention to speak to the Bill tonight, but it is important as it  is a historic night. I commend and congratulate John McCallister for his sheer  grit and determination to go through the process. As someone who is involved in  the early stages of a private Member&rsquo;s Bill, I know the amount of very tedious  and patient work that is required. I think that John will want to commend the  Bill Office for all its endeavours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is important and will give the ultimate protection  and regulation. An awful lot of abuse goes on with unscrupulous site owners,  and Jim Wells referred to some areas in which abuse takes place. Whether it is  to do with maintenance inside or outside a caravan or making people buy  high-priced decking, site owners give people no choice. Furthermore, if people  challenge site owners about the cost, the site owners are quick off the mark to  tell those people that if they do not like it, they can get off the site, with  no power to respond.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill sets a new standard. In Donegal and across Southern Ireland, thousands of caravan owners need the  same protection. We always talk about cross-border co-operation, so I hope that  someone in the Irish Government is listening to the debate. Previously, I met  Irish Government officials to discuss unscrupulous site owners, particularly in  and around Donegal, who abuse caravan owners. People there are not allowed to  meet or challenge site owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For John, personally, this is an important night. Well  done, and I hope that his efforts are recognised. Given the protection that he  has achieved for so many people, including vulnerable and innocent people, the  passing of the Bill will give them heart. I hope that the Bill places the  utmost regulation on site owners in Northern Ireland who think that  they can get away with abuses and have been getting away with them for many  years. As a caravan owner in Donegal, I should declare an interest. The abuses  that have gone on for decades cannot be allowed to continue, so I hope that  someone &mdash; even John &mdash; informs the Irish tourist board about the Bill, which  could be the way forward in protecting all caravan owners on the island.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will not detain the House too long. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to  acknowledge the generosity of the comments by Members on various Benches. Mr  Wells pleaded with us not to leak his comments to the local press. I can  probably assure him the John will not, but I might. Given that generosity, I  shall redress the balance by declaring that I am very pleased for my very good  friend Mr McCallister &mdash; there we go, it is in the Hansard report, so that is  him finished now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should all take some pride in the passing of the Bill.  Sometimes, we are accused of not working or not delivering. On reading the  debates, I was struck by the number of times that I said &ldquo;Aye&rdquo;, because that  was about all that I said. Nevertheless, I listened to the debates and realised  that real legislation was being worked out and real points were being made. As  the Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, Mr Hamilton, said,  there were undoubtedly contentious areas that had to be worked through, and  that was right and proper. His Committee did a very good job on getting through  the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was also kind of Mr Humphrey to say that the Bill is  very good all round. I hope that we have made a difference to many people&rsquo;s  lives. I was going to offer my personal congratulations to Mr McCallister, but  it is not really him that I should be congratulating; it is Annette, because,  while he took all the glory, she did all the work. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>On those kind words, I shall finish by wishing Mr McCallister all the  very best with the McCallister Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: As  Dawn Purvis said, although we have come to the end of one of our longest days,  we have also come, as other Members stated, to one of our rarest moments. It is  so rare that it is hard to believe. Only twice in 90 years has this happened in  this Building, and tonight is the second occurrence. This moment is almost  unique. Therefore, all the compliments to John McCallister for taking the Bill  through its various stages since 26 April 2010 have to be acknowledged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There must have been something in the air that night in  Tandragee, because since then John McCallister has got married, fathered a  child, become deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and sponsored and seen  the Bill through the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  That is Tandragee for you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: That is Tandragee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  But it is not all downhill<span class="Italic">. [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 midnight</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I was not anticipating the election on 5 May in that  regard, but congratulations for all those reasons.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I checked it out today, and last year, Westminster passed seven private Member&rsquo;s  Bills. In the lifetime of its current mandate, the Scottish Parliament has  passed four, has four more in the pipeline and two were withdrawn. The poor  Welsh Assembly has passed none, but it did not have primary legislative powers  until recently. Therefore, it did not have the capacity to do what John has  done in this House over the past months. The point behind that, which will be  touched on again in the subsequent debate, is that the capacity of legislators  to come forth with an idea, mould it into proposals, draft it into clauses and  guide it through all its legislative stages is something that John has set a  standard for, against which we should all be judged and judge ourselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to rehearse the scope of the Bill. That was  touched on before and spoken about tonight. However, like everybody else, I  want to acknowledge all those who contributed to the passage of the Bill,  beyond John&rsquo;s leadership on it. There are a lot of people to acknowledge. First  and foremost, I acknowledge my predecessor, Margaret Ritchie. It is very  difficult to get a private Member&rsquo;s Bill through, and I put firmly on the  record my appreciation of her assistance at ministerial level, working with and  being led by John. It was a difficult passage. There were, as Simon Hamilton  indicated, some difficult moments. Had it not been for her contribution and, in  a small way, belatedly, my own, we might not have been in this position  tonight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the work of the Bill Office. This has ended  up being a 28-page Bill; no, it is an 18-page Bill. The work of the Office of  the Legislative Counsel and the Bill Office has been essential in all of this.  It is not the convention to name civil servants from the Floor of the Assembly,  but given that Stephen Martin has been named already, I want to acknowledge his  work. He is not in the Officials&rsquo; Box tonight because, contrary to convention  in Departments, and without the knowledge of the permanent secretary, I told  him to go home at 6.00 pm, in anticipation of this being a long night. However,  as John and others have done, I want to acknowledge the contribution of Stephen  Martin in helping, always with good heart and a willing mind, to get the Bill  to where it is tonight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to acknowledge the role of the Environment  Committee, the Enterprise,  Trade and Investment Committee and the Social Development Committee. Their work  was substantial in all this. It demonstrates that when Committees work  together, when Members work together and when parties work together, we can  have a very productive outcome. There is certainly something in all that,  around which we can learn from the past and look forward to the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having acknowledged the Social Development Committee, I  want to particularly acknowledge its members and Chairperson. There were some  testing moments over the past months and some very significant hurdles to be  jumped, but all those tasks have been achieved. I want to acknowledge the  Executive, because they assisted in ensuring that various amendments got  appropriate endorsement, and those are reflected in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, ultimately, I come back to the fact that this  legislature is tonight, subject to the Bill being granted Royal Assent, making  a material difference for a community in Northern Ireland that did not  previously have the protection that it might have required. That will, to a  substantial degree, be corrected through the passage of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to again acknowledge the contribution of  John. He has shown resilience, fortitude, determination and all the skills that  make a good politician and a good legislator. I commend him for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I wonder whether everyone will join me in the election campaign &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have at least one who will.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  One volunteer already. I do not want to hold the House or the Member back from  his moment of glory now that a new day has dawned. I omitted in my earlier  remarks to indicate that I, too, am a caravan owner. I have no pecuniary  interest in the legislation, but lest anyone be sent off to find out why I did  not declare my interest, I do so gladly now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The good news is that the Member&rsquo;s caravan is in the beautiful South Down  constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to Members for their kind remarks. I will sum  up briefly. Mr Hamilton paid tribute to the Bill Office. The legislation is big  for a private Member&rsquo;s Bill. I did not realise that until quite a bit into the  process, and I am grateful to the Committee staff. I had a brief stint on the  Social Development Committee; perhaps Mr Hamilton felt that my party leader  sent me there only to speed things along. However, I assure him that that was  not the only reason. I enjoyed my brief time on the Social Development  Committee. Mr Hamilton is right that the industry has worked well with the  Committee and with myself and Annette Holden to shape the Bill. Of course,  members liked some bits and not others, but they worked to put the legislation  in place early before we hit the difficult times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Ramsey. He will know about the issue, given his  private Member&rsquo;s Bill on helmets, which I got into all sorts of bother for  voting for. It is important that a private Member&rsquo;s Bill goes to Committee so  that the work can be done. The Bill Office has a key role in advising Members  in that. There are huge issues. The written agreements that the Caravans Bill  will introduce will go a long way to addressing some of the issues that Mr  Ramsey raised about people who feel that they have been abused financially by  site owners. The Bill will make the process more open and transparent and, of  course, caravan owners will have the right to form owners&rsquo; associations to  voice their views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I look around the Chamber and see that Mr McCrea, Mr  Wells and Mr Hamilton are still here, I am concerned about who will do &lsquo;The  Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; in the morning.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span> I am  worried that you will all sound terribly sleepy. I was even more concerned when  Mr McCrea described me as a very good friend; I assure my party leader that  that is not the case. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> In fact, I have  never seen him before.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Minister is here to respond to the  debate, and I hope that he passes on my thanks to his party leader and  predecessor, Margaret Ritchie, for her contribution to the Bill in availing herself  of the Office of the Legislative Counsel and pushing it through. I thank the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister as well. The fact that  amendments that were made at Consideration Stage and Further Consideration  Stage were guided by the Minister was of enormous help to me and to the process  of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The fact that departmental officials were available  to the Committee was enormously helpful and important to the smooth progression  of the Bill, so I thank him for that. I thank him and Dawn Purvis for their  research in finding out that the last time a private Member&rsquo;s Bill was passed  was all the way back in 1931. I took a rough guess that it was possibly some  time back in the 1960s, but I did not imagine that it would be as far back as  that. It is a rare occasion, and there was a great deal of work, but, if I am  re-elected on 5 May, that will not deter me from introducing other private  Member&rsquo;s Bills on important issues such as this.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  have been out of the Chamber catching up with other work, and I wanted to make  sure that, from the Alliance Party Benches, we put on record our  congratulations to John McCallister on getting the Bill through to this stage.  No doubt, it is about to be adopted. Although I have been slightly tongue-in-cheek  in praising him over the past couple of days, my comments are 100% genuine.  Well done, John.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I will definitely not go into the issues on which the Member was praising me  over the past couple of days, but I am grateful to him and his party  colleagues, particularly Anna Lo, for her contribution as a member of the  Committee for Social Development. I thank all Members for their support, advice  and assistance in guiding and shaping the Bill to where it is today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Caravans Bill [NIA 17/09] do now pass.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call the sponsor, Mr David McNarry, to move the Consideration Stage of the  Armed Forces and Veterans Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Good morning, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Moved. &mdash; [Mr McNarry.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments detailing the  order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for debate in my  provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I inform Members that a valid petition of concern was  presented on Thursday 10 February in relation to the Bill&rsquo;s eight clauses and  the long title. I remind Members that the effect of the petition is that the  vote on the clauses and the long title will be on a cross-community basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a single group of amendments, comprising amendment  Nos 1 to 9, which deal with departmental responsibilities, Orders and regulations.  Once the debate on the group is completed, any further amendments will be moved  formally as we go through the Bill, and the Question on each will be put  without further debate. The Questions on stand part will be taken at the  appropriate points in the Bill. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-ClauseHeading">Clause 1 (General duty to have due regard to  the impact of the exercise of functions on the services community)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 1, it will  be convenient to debate amendment Nos 2 to 9. The amendments would transfer the  responsibilities that the Bill places on the Department of Finance and  Personnel to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. They  would also provide for regulations to be made prescribing the functions of a  co-ordinator.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I inform Members that amendment Nos 2 and 3 are mutually  exclusive and that amendment Nos 3 to 8 are paving amendments for amendment No  9.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very proud to be associated with the Bill and with the  deserving people to whom it relates. I hope that the House will join me, this  morning as it is now, in securing for them due recognition and respect by  supporting Consideration Stage and advancing the Bill towards a positive  conclusion. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak up for the Bill and for  those who will benefit from the Assembly&rsquo;s approval.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of grouped amendments will strengthen my Bill.  However, sadly and regrettably, I am aware of the lodging of a petition of  concern. It is a shoddy tactic against the Bill. Regrettably, it has served  only to bring into the open serious elements of discrimination and sectarianism  that we on this side of the House thought were behind us as we pursued  betterment for all our people who live, work and are educated here and who seek  to enjoy life to the full or as best they can in a shared society. With your  permission, Mr Speaker, I will return to that issue later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said to the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister and to the House, my Bill does not give  anyone special category status, queue-jumping priority, extra privileges or  specific advantages. All it would do is remove disadvantages. The Bill is  entirely designed to give equality to members of the armed forces: the Army,  the Air Force, the Navy, the families and the veterans. The amendments also  serve to allocate responsibilities to the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister for hearing my explanation of the thinking behind the  Bill and the amendments. I also thank the Committee staff, the Assembly&rsquo;s Research  Services, the Speaker&rsquo;s Office and the Bill Office for helping my Bill to reach  this crucial stage. I also thank the witnesses who came forward to the  Committee, the respondents who submitted written comments to the Committee and,  not least, the Equality Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is pertinent to our discussion: after a careful  reading of the Bill, the Equality Commission told the Committee that it seemed</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;not to conflict with any equality or  anti-discrimination legislation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The commission said &mdash; I suggest that this is relevant  to all the amendments before us &mdash; that</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Bill creates a duty for a range of specified  authorities to give due regard to the impact that the exercise of their  functions may have on an identified category of people, service personnel and  their families.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It added:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Bill confers no preference and makes no  requirement of any public authority around any action required to be taken  following the giving of due regard to that impact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">By encapsulating the purpose of the Bill as being  that those who serve must not be disadvantaged by virtue of what they do, the  Equality Commission succinctly summed up for the Assembly what the amendments  to my Bill can achieve. Regrettably, it appears that there are those who are  not convinced by any amendments. By using the tactic of a petition of concern,  they seem intent on further disadvantaging people who live in our communities.  However, I contend that it would be commendable if the whole House were to  judge the Bill and the amendments on the merits of a genuine desire to ensure  that no one who lives among us would or should be disadvantaged. It is not  those who wear the uniform who are at fault; the problem lies with those who  are unwilling to recognise and respect people in a British uniform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Neither the Bill nor the amendments have hidden agendas.  The Bill brings to Northern    Ireland due regard to members of the armed  forces, their families and veterans. It also gives due regard to the impact of  functions on the services community. That is the genuine and honest purpose of  my Bill. It was such from the beginning. There are no other intentions behind  it. The Bill, along with the amendments, takes account of those commitments.  Therefore, the proposals relate to devolved matters which include prosthetic limb  provision; access to NHS dentistry; the health needs of veterans; getting on  the NHS waiting list; the roll-out of community mental health; affordable  homes; adaptable social housing; adapted affordable homes; disabled facilities;  affordable homes that extend access for veterans; social housing with local  connections; a certificate of cessation; homelessness; school place allocation;  educational attainment; special educational needs; education and training for  service leavers; basic skills for families; concessionary bus travel; blue  badge access; childcare provision; flexible careers in the armed forces;  support to the volunteer reserve forces; and support to the employment of  service families and the employment of service leavers in the public sector. The  Bill and the amendments can address the fact that those people can lose out on  all of that, which is why it makes good sense to accept the amendments that  pass all-round responsibility from DFP to OFMDFM.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, with the amendments, is an exercise in fairness  and equality. It extends rights that are available elsewhere in the United Kingdom to former and serving members of  the armed forces and their families in Northern Ireland. The amendments  that relate to OFMDFM identify the important job that needs to be done in a  businesslike and no-nonsense way that best suits the competency of the Bill.  With the amendments made, the Bill will be seen by many observers as a test of  the genuineness of the commitment to equality that is so often professed by  Members of the Assembly. It is a Bill with genuine and open intent. As I said,  there are no hidden agendas, simply a desire to extend rights that are already  enjoyed elsewhere in our country. I ask Members to reflect on that and to give  the Bill and the amendments fair passage. As far as I am concerned, there is no  political subtext.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has never been a time when the public have been more  aware of the sheer professionalism and dedication of our armed forces, often in  the face of official neglect and systematic and scandalous underfunding and  underequipping in the most dangerous of circumstances. The Armed Forces and  Veterans Bill would be a legal charter for our armed services personnel. It  would press Stormont Departments to ensure that the armed forces, their families  and veterans are not disadvantaged because of their military service. It will  extend rights that are available to armed service personnel and their families  in other parts of the United    Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill and the amendments that were tabled for this  evening &mdash; now this morning &mdash; assert how important the role of OFMDFM can be in  addressing all the rights involved. It is crucial that the Assembly knows that  I have deliberately not sought to lobby on the Bill. I have not made contact  with the many organisations, including the Royal British Legion, to ask them  what they think of the Bill or to take a view of the new amendments that we  will talk about this morning. I have taken that approach because I did not  want, in any way, to diminish the integrity of the Bill or the people whose  futures I seek, with the help of the House, to address. I deliberately stayed  away from that so that I could not and would not ever be accused of political  lobbying for the Bill. I contend that the Bill, with the proposed amendments,  is right for Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will now deal with the  petition of concern. I consider that it is being used as a destructive, mean  and wholly suspect device to kill the Bill and the amendments. A number of  issues arise, which I need to say. It seems clear to me that the  pan-nationalist front has been lurking in the shadows until moments like this  to unwrap its deceit and the covering-up of a sinister, deep-rooted hatred for  Britishness. That is what you are saying to me. The joint action of two parties  to kill this Bill is as cutting and as hurtful as the sniper&rsquo;s bullets that are  used to take out a life, confine a person to a wheelchair or send them into a  future of stress, trauma and mental hell, with the obvious effect on their  family. In respect of the Bill and the amendments that we are discussing, what  is the definition of constitutional nationalism riding on the back of the  Provisional Irish republican movement? What does partnership government mean  for Sinn F&eacute;in, the all-Ireland party with its split personality policy  disorder? Is the real message not tied up in the petition of concern?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, the Committee report and the amendments are about  members of Her Majesty&rsquo;s armed forces and their families. Enda Kenny, the man  most likely to be Taoiseach, has said that, should a visit take place, Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth would receive a generous welcome in the Republic. I am  sure that he is right and speaks for the greater number, by far, of Irish  democrats in that nation. I wonder what those same sane people will think of  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s election doorstep appeal when they learn that the  commander-in-chief of this nation&rsquo;s armed forces, their families and veterans  is not, according to Sinn F&eacute;in, welcome in their country, not fit for equality  and not deserving of having certain disadvantages removed. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s hostile  and sectarian treatment of such people, who are from a variety of nations,  including the Irish   Republic, is based purely  on the British uniform that those people wear. Is that why 44 MLAs have put  their name to this shameful petition of concern?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember some spin doctors who were caught in their own  euphoric whirlpool of superimposed optimism. They coined the phrase &ldquo;We have  moved on&rdquo; about this place. According to those using a petition of concern, it  seems that that is not the case. Look at what is happening to this Bill and the  amendments, and you can see that we have not moved on. If anything, the actions  represented by the combined efforts of the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in are bent on  moving us backwards. That is the clearest signal that they are sending. And for  what? They see no shame in their action, and their extreme dislike for a  British uniform is so perverse that they cannot see that the person wearing it  is a human being rather than a figure of hate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill and the tabled amendments should meet with the  House&rsquo;s approval. They have done so with the OFMDFM Committee, and, given a  vote without a veto, I am positive that they would do so tonight. The blocking  of the Bill and the amendments, clause by clause, represents a turning point in  my thinking about what was a mood change for developing a settlement of minds  leading to the respect and accommodation of two traditions.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For four years we have managed &mdash; just about, at times &mdash; to  keep the House together, and in a few weeks&rsquo; time we will reach something that  many of us thought might not be possible: we will have completed a term and set  a wonderful precedent for those coming in in the next mandate. I wanted that,  and I see it in the Bill. I see it passionately, because I am only talking  about people. I do not see the uniform. I see them living in my community. I  see their children going to our schools. I see their wives going to the same  shops as we go to, and I have not got a clue who they are, because the wives  and children do not wear the uniforms, yet we are picking out people who do  wear a uniform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What is not being recognised in my Bill and what I wanted  to be recognised is cross-community support for the people I am talking about.  I also see that in the amendments and what they will do. None of that is  noticeable, because there are no amendments from Sinn F&eacute;in or the SDLP. All  that is noticeable tonight is their petition of concern. That premeditated,  spiteful blocking of the Bill will do untold damage to relationships. If ever a  wrecking device was used so intentionally and deliberately to drive a wedge  between us or unhinge the progress that I have spoken about, they have made it.  If this is a veto against our Britishness, that is how it will be seen, and  that is what I see in it. Perhaps that is what Sinn F&eacute;in wants to achieve.  Perhaps that is the sum total of its game.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The petition of concern is all about rejecting the Bill and  the amendments, forfeiting all we have come though and closing down whatever opportunities  may lie ahead for future generations, all because they simply cannot stomach  giving a man or woman wearing a British armed forces uniform or their family  the simple human decency of ensuring that those who serve must not be  disadvantaged by virtue of what they do. I look forward to the debate and  commend the Bill and the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (Mr Elliott)</strong>: I declare an interest as a former member of the security  services and a member of the Royal British Legion. In addressing this group of  amendments, I want to refer to the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill. I note  that at this stage there is a petition of concern in relation to the clauses  and the long title. The Committee was not consulted or advised of the petition  of concern, and therefore has no comment on it. However, throughout the  Committee&rsquo;s consideration of the Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in representatives stated their  opposition to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following the Second Stage of the Bill, the Speaker issued  a letter to the Chairpersons of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister and the Committee for Finance and Personnel  requesting that they consider Committee scrutiny of the Bill as a matter of  joint concern under Standing Order 64. The Chairpersons discussed which  Committee should take forward the Committee Stage of the Bill and agreed that  the OFMDFM Committee should do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 20 October 2010, the then Chairperson, Mr Kennedy,  advised that he had agreed that the OFMDFM Committee would take forward the  Committee Stage of the Bill. The Committee agreed at that meeting that it would  undertake the Committee Stage of the Armed Forces and Veterans Bill. On that  date, it also agreed to issue a public notice seeking written evidence on the  clauses of the Bill and to write to a number of identified stakeholders to seek  their views on the Bill. The public notice was placed in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;,  &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; and the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; on 25 October 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 10 November 2010, the Committee agreed a timetable for  the Committee&rsquo;s consideration of the Bill and agreed a motion to seek an  extension to Committee Stage until 28 January 2011. The Committee also  considered the responses to its call for evidence. It received 13 written  submissions and agreed to request that the sponsor, Mr David McNarry MLA, brief  the Committee on the Bill. The Committee also wrote twice to the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to request its views on the Bill. It  has not yet received a response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 24 November 2010, the Committee took evidence from Mr  David McNarry MLA, who advised it that the intention of the Bill was to end any  disadvantage that members of the armed forces, their families and veterans may  suffer because of service in the armed forces and to bring Northern Ireland legislation  into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom. At the same meeting, the  Committee agreed to request legal advice on the competence of the Armed Forces  and Veterans Bill in relation to existing equality legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 15 December 2010, the Committee noted a response to the  request for legal advice from the Clerk Assistant that provided procedural  advice. The Committee then agreed to invite the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland  to brief it on the Bill in relation to equality. On 12 January 2011, the  Committee was briefed by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland on the Bill in  relation to equality. The Committee considered proposed amendments from the  Committee for Finance and Personnel and the Department of Finance and Personnel  requesting that any reference in the Bill to the Department of Finance and  Personnel be changed to refer to the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also considered amendments from the Examiner  of Statutory Rules. It agreed to write to Mr McNarry to advise that he might  wish to take the amendments forward. On 19 January 2011, the Committee  undertook its formal clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill. During the meeting,  Mr McNarry agreed to take the amendments forward. The Committee considered  amendment No 1 and amendment Nos 3 to 9 during its clause-by-clause scrutiny  and agreed, on division, that it was content with the amendments. It also  agreed, on division, to all the clauses. The Committee did not consider amendment  No 2 and, therefore, has no view on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make some personal comments. I congratulate my  colleague Mr McNarry on bringing the Bill forward and getting it this far. I  feel, on a personal level, that it is very rewarding and necessary within the  community and society that we live in. I am disappointed that a pan-nationalist  and republican front lodged the petition of concern. That is particularly  difficult, as the Bill would provide equality in a number of areas and much  fairer representation. The citizens of this community who are members and  veterans of the armed forces and their families deserve this Bill. They deserve  it in the sense that they deserve equality. They deserve it because, as Mr  McNarry explained, they are citizens of this Province, this community and the United Kingdom  and deserve the same respect and equality as everyone else who lives here. So,  it is particularly difficult for me to accept that this petition of concern was  lodged by some of the representatives who continue to claim equality in this  community and this Province but do not want to allow it through this Bill. That  is disturbing and concerning for me. As someone who served in the security  services in this Province, I served the entire community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like others, I served everybody in this society, and I  served alongside people from various backgrounds. I am sure that those people  and their families feel as aggrieved as I do that the petition of concern is  attempting to block the Bill. I recall people who served alongside me but who  were not from the same religious or community background as me. They served  with the same distinction, vigour and desire to serve the entire community as I  did in the hope that they would make this a better society for us all to live  in. Therefore, it disappoints me that some people are trying to disadvantage  those people and their families.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  I, too, support the Bill and congratulate Mr McNarry for bringing it before the  House this morning. My party supported the Bill throughout its Committee Stage  in the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  because it provides for certain public bodies to have due regard for the impact  of policy and legislation on members of the armed forces community. The Bill  also requires each Department to identify and to address issues for members of  the armed forces. It also obliges Northern Ireland Departments to consult their  counterparts in England, Scotland and Wales to ensure consistency in  policy and legislation impacts on the armed forces communities between  jurisdictions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is about equality. I served in the Police Service  for 30 years, many of which were spent alongside military colleagues who came  not only from this Province but from the rest of the United Kingdom. I know how much  military personnel and their families have to move and the associated  disruption that that causes for family life when it comes to schooling and the  availability of care. That movement is particularly disruptive to families who  have children with special educational needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During my time on the South Eastern Education and Library  Board, it was clear that some of the schools that are closely attached to our  military bases, particularly primary schools, have many changes of personnel,  because children come in, stay a couple of years and move again. That movement  puts a strain on family life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill merely brings equality to those people and to  veterans, many of whom have suffered horrendous injuries. Some of those  injuries were incurred recently by personnel serving in Afghanistan and  other places, and even in our Province. The Bill is about ensuring equality for  folks who came from military service back into normal society. It was to help  them to integrate again with the community or communities that they were coming  to live in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From day one of the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage, it was clear  that Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the Bill. That was made very clear by Ms Anderson, who  espouses equality almost day and daily. I hear her at the Policing Board, in  the House and all over the place talking about equality. However, when it comes  to our military personnel and their families, equality goes out the window.  What surprised me more than anything else was that Mrs Kelly raised few  concerns throughout the Bill&rsquo;s passage at Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  None.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  As the Member correctly said, Mrs Kelly raised no concerns as the Bill passed  through the Committee. She rarely raised her voice. However, as has been said,  pan-nationalism joined together to table a petition of concern on the Bill, and  from the perspective of this side of the House, that is disturbing and  disappointing. At least Sinn F&eacute;in made its position clear from day one.  However, I was surprised when the SDLP joined in that pan-nationalist front.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry made it clear from the start that he was not  seeking any special status for military personnel, the veterans or their  families. He also made it clear that it was all about equality for all members  of the armed forces throughout the United Kingdom,  and ensuring that Northern    Ireland was part and parcel of that equality  as it affects our military personnel here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not always see eye to eye with the Equality  Commission, but it was clear in its position when it met the Committee. Sinn  F&eacute;in was keen to bring the Equality Commission to the Committee, and when it  came, it gave fairly extensive evidence that was recorded by Hansard. It told  the Committee that it had no issues or concerns with the Bill and that it did  not conflict, in any way, with any part of the equality legislation of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, as Sinn F&eacute;in could not get the Equality  Commission to place a blocking mechanism on the legislation, the next move was  to table the petition of concern. Sinn F&eacute;in did not make it clear to the  Committee at any stage that it was going to use a petition of concern to block  the legislation, as the Chairperson of the Committee has clearly and ably said.  However, that was the intent all along the way, and the SDLP was in on that  little plan. Shame on those parties; they should never again talk to me about  equality. If they cannot have equality for military personnel, they should not  espouse it and keep pushing it down our throats on a day and daily basis, not  just in this Chamber, but in other forums, such as the Policing Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very disappointed that the Bill will be blocked  through a petition of concern. I congratulate Mr McNarry on bringing the Bill  to the House, and I assure him and the Speaker of the DUP&rsquo;s support for all the  amendments. Irrespective of a petition of concern or anything else, we will put  down the marker of where this side of the House stands on equality, and it is  equality that was rightly deserved &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member, the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor and the Chairperson of the Committee have spoken out  against the use of the petition of concern. However, Members should consider  the petition of concern as a double attack on the Bill. Members have signed the  petition of concern, but because the petition of concern only creates the need  to have a cross-community vote, there is still an opportunity for the Members  opposite, if they were to have a dramatic conversion, to support the Bill. If  that happened, the Bill would pass, even with the petition of concern. By  voting against the Bill, they are actually taking a second decision to kill it  off. They are killing it twice, and many Members on this side of the House find  that particularly repugnant.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Yes, indeed. My friend makes a valid point. If Members on the opposite side of  the House really believe in equality, I appeal to them to let us see equality  in action, to change their minds and vote for the Bill and to let it go through  on the equality basis that has been presented. The challenge is over to them &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the Members opposite do not have to vote for the  Bill, they merely have to abstain? If they were to do so, the Bill would go  through.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Yes, indeed, and I have already made that appeal to them. They may abstain or  do whatever they have to do, but they should live up to the equality that they  preach day and daily.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  appreciate what has been said. Obviously, the Speaker will rule when it comes  to the vote. However, my understanding is that it requires a majority and that  at least one Member opposite would have to have the courage of his or her  convictions to support the Bill for it to pass. The rest could abstain. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Not even Stephen Farry riding in as the  seventh cavalry could rescue this particular one.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  will leave it to the Speaker to get into the technicalities. However, I have  said what I want to say.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Does the Member agree that given that this is a short Bill of three pages, with  no equality or human rights issues and a very small financial implication, the  opposition from the Members opposite has little to do with the substance of the  Bill and more to do with an election in the coming weeks.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Who  is going to be greener?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  It is very clear that the opposition is about elections and about seeing who  can be greener. Once again, the SDLP is trying to be greener than the Shinners.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I will certainly be opposing the Bill,  as will my party. The word &ldquo;equality&rdquo; has been raised along with the term  &ldquo;petition of concern&rdquo;. Only a short while ago, Members on the opposite Benches  signed a petition of concern on the Caravans Bill with regard to the Travellers  issue. Nobody on the other side of the House should lecture me or anyone else  on this side of the House about equality. That important point has to be made.  Mr McNarry referred to shoddy tactics. I do not think that it is shoddy  tactics. It is a shoddy Bill, and that is why we are opposing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not believe that the Bill is about equality, although  that is stated a number of times in the Bill. It is more about preferential  treatment, which is wrong. I will speak for a few moments only because that is  all that I have to offer the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is about preferential treatment. I represent a  community in the constituency of West Belfast,  which has many disadvantaged wards. Very few people in the past, including  British rule Ministers, have dedicated any finances to that area, other areas in  North Belfast or many areas across the North  of Ireland. Those are the inequalities that many of us have faced when living,  working and representing our constituencies. Those are the issues that need to  be addressed. Some of the issues in the Bill relate to housing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  No thanks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues in the Bill relate to housing. For the  past nine years, I have worked for people in my constituency who have been  trying to get a house from the Housing Executive. The Bill would mean that  someone from the so-called armed forces would be able to get a house ahead of  another person, even if that other person was near the offering stage and was  to get a house in a few days. The preference would have to go to someone from  the armed forces. I do not think that I could allow that to happen or would  like to see that happen. I do not think that many of my constituents would like  to see that happen either, because they have fought far too long and too hard  to ensure that their needs, wants and requirements are met by getting houses.  That is an important issue. I do not think that it would be equality if someone  could jump above them in the housing waiting list.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  No, thanks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Health is another aspect of this Bill. Someone living in my  constituency is likely to die six years earlier than someone who lives in a  more affluent area. Is that equality? Those are the equality issues that the  Assembly and the Executive need to tackle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  No, thanks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the issues that I am asked about day and daily.  Why do I not have a home? Why are we all on hospital waiting lists for  operations? God forbid that someone in my constituency with a serious illness  should have to go into hospital for an operation. If we pass this Bill, does it  mean that a person from the armed forces with the same illness would get  preferential treatment? That is what the Bill tells me, and that is why my  party and I cannot support the Bill. Those are the big issues that we need to  deal with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will certainly not fall into the trap that Mr McNarry  tried to set at the start of this debate. He talked about building bridges and  relationships. In his contribution, he built no bridges across this Chamber. In  his contributions over the past four years in this Assembly, he has built very  few bridges. Whether in the Chamber, on &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; or through any  of the media outlets, he has done very little of that. He has certainly never  come to me on any issue and asked how we can work together on it in the  Assembly. Mr McNarry has failed to do that, and there are only a couple of  weeks left in this mandate. If he has failed to do that over the past four  years, he will more than likely fail to do so over the next four weeks. I think  that that is wrong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As to equality, our party slogan is &ldquo;an Ireland for  equals&rdquo;. That is what I want to see, and that is what I fight for and work for  in the Assembly. That is what all our elected representatives, right across the  island of Ireland, work for day and daily. We want  to make sure that no matter what community you come from, no matter what  religion you are, no matter what colour your skin, you are treated as an equal.  There should be no preferential treatment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  No, thanks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should all stick to that: no preferential treatment. We  have seen far too much preferential treatment over the years. If we stick to no  preferential treatment, the Assembly will do itself justice and will do justice  for our citizens right across the North of Ireland. That is what this is about:  equality for everyone. Sinn F&eacute;in will oppose this Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am dismayed at the comments of some of the Members on the Benches opposite.  When the Committee considered the Bill that is being brought forward by Mr  McNarry, I listened carefully to the representations and justifications for it.  I note that there were only 13 responses, some of which were from individuals  and some of which were from councils. In fact, I think that responses had to be  sought from the British Legion and some other Army service support groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it very clear that our objection to the Bill  is not based on a hatred of Britishness. My party and I remain unconvinced that  there are any inequalities because there are armed forces personnel and  veterans whose needs are not met through the section 75 protections of the Good  Friday Agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party and I remain unconvinced. We have not yet heard  from Members of any glaring examples of individuals, or of any great numbers of  individuals, being disadvantaged by the absence of this Bill. We believe that  public services should be targeted at those who are most in need and that all  people have a right to expect quality public services. That is something that  we seek to deliver through our Minister&rsquo;s Department and by holding to account  and scrutinising all other Departments&rsquo; service delivery and how they target  their resources.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I regret the tone of some of the Members on the opposite  Benches. I listened carefully to what the Equality Commission had to say, and  although it told the Committee that the Bill did not appear to contain any  inequalities, it did not know how its outworking would affect other users of  public services across the North. I regret that we find ourselves in this  position, but, unfortunately, we were unconvinced by the arguments of Mr  McNarry and others.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support the Bill, and I may even speak to the amendments as well, if that is  OK, particularly the one tabled in my name and that of my colleague Kieran  McCarthy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will offer my view on the petition of concern. The  rules permit it, but I understand the frustrations that have been expressed by  a number of Members about it. I do not associate myself one bit with the  language that has been used to describe the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in as a  pan-nationalist or pan-republican front. That does not help, and although I  understand that there are deep frustrations, the language used and the  sentiments expressed are not conducive to moving the Assembly forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are frustrations over the blocking of the substance  of the Bill. I want to make a second point about the feelings of frustration.  The Bill has not changed substantively since it was introduced, apart from  several amendments substituting the Department of Finance and Personnel for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which did not amount to  a big change. If parties were intent on blocking the Bill, why was it not  blocked at Second Stage, when it passed unopposed? What has changed since then  to cause the Bill to be blocked now? If parties want to block it, that is their  democratic right. However, the consequence of not blocking the Bill at Second  Stage is not just the fact that we are debating it this morning but that the  OFMDFM Committee has gone through the process of discussing it. That comes at  the cost of not discussing other things in the Committee and of putting  advertisements in the papers. Those may be small matters, but they add up. If  Members were intent on blocking the Bill, why, for goodness&rsquo; sake, did they not  block it earlier rather than later in the process?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that my party is not a big fan of  petitions of concern. We recognise that the function has to be there for  extreme cases, but it must only be used for a narrow range of topics. We  should, ultimately, be moving towards weighted-majority voting without  designations, which would perhaps be a better safeguard. We also recognise that  when we pass laws or make decisions, we do not do so unfettered. There are  wider human rights and equality protections available to us, as well as the  protection of general law, which acts as a check and balance on the Assembly. If  Members feel that a majority can force something through, that is not right.  There are other checks and balances available in wider society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been on a journey with the Bill. To be fair, Mr  McNarry knows that, and he and I have had a discussion about it, unlike others.  I was unclear about the Bill at the outset, but I was happy to see it go to  Committee. My concern was that the Bill would compromise equality protections  and would privilege a certain section of the community over others. For that reason,  I was particularly keen that the Committee should take evidence from  representatives of the Equality Commission, because it is best placed to give a  considered opinion. Its unambiguous opinion was that the Bill, as presented,  did not conflict with wider equality law and equality duties. I took heart from  that, and it convinced me that we could support the Bill. That type of process  is why we have a Committee Stage in which Members can properly scrutinise  legislation. Where there are doubts, those can be addressed and satisfied.  Having gone into that session with the Equality Commission still somewhat  sceptical about the Bill, I came out of it prepared to recommend it to the rest  of my party and to speak in favour of it in the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 reflects that we have not had enough  engagement on some of the detail of the Bill. A lot of organisations did not  come forward with evidence. I was slightly concerned about the way in which  clause 2 was drafted in relation to the duties that would be placed on a  Department and, in particular, on a co-ordinator in a Department. In  consultation with the Bill Office about my concerns, the view was that rather  than including a lot of specifics, the safest way in which to progress the Bill  was to state the detail of how Departments would respond to their duties  through regulations. Therefore, amendment No 2 aims to put that aspect of the  Bill at arm&rsquo;s length, pause for greater reflection on how it will work, and ask  Departments to come back with their own regulations on how we take it forward.  That is perhaps a slightly more cautious way of addressing it. I may move the  amendment, depending on how things go later on, or it may well be academic at  that stage. I will see how things turn out. However, that is an important  matter to address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Far be it from me to make the case for the Bill as a whole,  but I wish to make two brief points. First, equality is not divisible in  society. Being sensitive or having due regard to a particular section of  society in respect of equality, does not, in itself, undermine equality, access  to equal treatment and opportunity for everyone else in society. Secondly,  there is already a lot of good practice in how a whole range of public bodies,  whether the Health Service or particular schools, respond to the needs of  service personnel and service families. The point of the legislation is that  that is not always guaranteed. Legislation would go some way to giving that  protection. I am familiar with schools that have a very large number of  children of service personnel going through their doors. There are particular  challenges involved in what is, in effect, a transitory population in respect  of how those people bed down in the community and access dental services, GP  services, and so on. We need to have sensitivity towards those people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the ultimate rationale behind the Bill; it is not  overly sinister. It is really about ensuring that how people who serve on  behalf of the UK  and the families who suffer as a consequence lead their lives is taken into  account. Doing that for those people does not detract in any way, shape or form  from how other people in society access services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  First and foremost, I am also very disappointed that a petition of concern has  been tabled. In a previous debate on the Bill, I said how strong my family&rsquo;s  links with the services are. I am extremely proud of those links. For a number  of years, I worked as a civil servant with a large number of military personnel  at the former Shackleton Barracks military site in Ballykelly. I know from  first-hand experience that those service personnel and their families need to  be treated on the basis of equality &mdash; nothing more, nothing less. As has  already been stated, the Equality Commission had no issues with the Bill at  Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In supporting the Bill, I am paying the respect owed to  those who served in many conflicts, ancient and ongoing. I will repeat  something that I said in the Chamber back in October. This Bill is about  equality of treatment for our service personnel and their families. The nature  of the job that servicemen and servicewomen do, and the constant need for them  to be posted here, there and everywhere across the world, means that they do  not have a stable home in the way that most of us do. That is no reason for  them to be denied the very best care when they need it most. That is  particularly true in respect of service personnel and veterans who received the  most horrendous injuries while serving their country. Injured personnel may be  recuperating at home, miles away from where the original treatment was given,  but that should not lead to delays in treatment or mean that they are put to  the bottom of waiting lists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make no apologies for repeating myself, as I feel that  this is the essence of the Bill. Whether in housing, health or education,  veterans and the families of serving personnel need to be treated with respect  and understanding due to their highly mobile lives. It is their country that  requires them to move, and society should ensure that they are looked after.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will ensure equality of treatment and opportunity;  that is all. Many Members talk about equality, and now they have the  opportunity to show their dedication to it. I am talking about the people on  the other side of the Floor. I hope that, even at this late stage, those  Members will show some support for the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I support the Bill. I begin by saying that I am extremely disappointed at the  discourtesy shown to the Bill by the Sinn F&eacute;in Members who sit on the OFMDFM  Committee and have failed to turn up for the debate. Those on this side of the  House support the Bill because it recognises the contribution made to the life  of our nation by the service community. I congratulate Mr McNarry on the hard  work and dedication that he has put into the Bill over recent months and on his  attendance in Committee, as mentioned by others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am saddened but not surprised by the petition of concern  that has been submitted by Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP. It must be recognised that  the service community in Northern    Ireland represents some 5,000 people in the  standing garrison plus the wives and families who are quartered here. Of  course, thousands of people from Northern Ireland are serving in the  armed forces elsewhere, and their families have also served previously, at home  and abroad, in their dedication to those who are in the forces. I emphasise the  role of families, because those who are involved in fighting are the tip of the  iceberg. All their courage and commitment would not be possible if they did not  have the support of the families at home. Although the soldiers do the fighting  and bleeding on foreign soil, their wives are at home doing the crying and  worrying and making ends meet. They are looking after children, doing school  runs and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage I pay tribute to the bravery of those who  served in the forces in Northern    Ireland: the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the  Ulster Defence Regiment, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Royal  Irish Regiment. I pay tribute to those personnel and their families. It must be  remembered that they returned and continue to return to their private homes. They  did not return to barracks or bases protected by security. Among the bravest of  those people were those from the Roman Catholic community who joined the police  and the Army, such as Constable Peadar Heffron, who was blown up last year. He  is the type of person we are looking to support, protect and deliver equality  for though the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Teddy Roosevelt said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A man who is good enough to shed his blood for the  country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It was true in 1903, and it should remain true  today. We should extend this to reflect the sacrifice of service families also.  We must move to a positive position in the United   Kingdom and, in particular, here in Northern Ireland  in which we recognise that soldiers, sailors and airmen are essential public  workers, just like teachers, doctors, nurses and policemen. They go wherever  they are sent to do the job they are told to do. Unfortunately, the nature of  their job is such that they and, in particular, their families are often  disadvantaged with respect to their ability to access public services. The Bill  seeks to safeguard them against that. Clearly, the parties opposite oppose that  very principle. The proposed amendments are sensible, as they place the  responsibility for implementing this legislation where it should rightly lie &mdash;  in a cross-cutting measure that applies across a range of Departments and  public bodies.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is aimed at tackling disadvantage and preventing  the social exclusion of soldiers and their families, who, despite the very  dangerous nature of their work, are paid substantially less than others in  public service. It will also help to make society in Northern Ireland much more  cohesive. That is why I was particularly saddened when I listened to Mr Maskey,  who clearly has not even read the Bill. I represent many hard-pressed areas as  well, so I know that there are many deprived communities in north and west Belfast, but do not say  that many of the wards in those areas have not received investment. Millions of  pounds have been pumped into them. There is much more work to be done, but do  not say that there has not been any investment there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All too often, people hit out at measures that are seen to  have anything to do with the military, and it is plain to see the motives of  those who regard the services as being the arm of the state. That is a very  narrow, parochial and, some might say, even sectarian view that is more to do  with the conflict than with what is going on around the world today. Sinn F&eacute;in  talks about an Ireland  of equals, and we have heard that again tonight. However, it really prefers an  &lsquo;Animal Farm&rsquo; situation where some Irishmen are more equal than others,  including an increasing number from the Republic of Ireland  who serve in the Crown forces. It is particularly disappointing that the SDLP  has also been willing to buy into that mindset, given that it has preached for  years about moving beyond conflict. Its decision to support the petition of  concern is to its discredit and shame. It needs to take a leaf from the book of  their friends in America.  Even the most vociferous Democratic opponent of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would not dream of  showing anything less than full, wholehearted support for the servicemen and  servicewomen who are fighting there. As Mr Ross said, for some across the  Chamber, this is not about principle but posturing, electioneering and party  politicking. It is disgusting. If Members want to disagree with war, argue with  the politicians, because they deploy the troops. Soldiers are public servants  who obey orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly said that she had not heard from anyone about the  disadvantage that servicemen would experience if we did not support the Bill,  and I will come to that in a moment. I am genuinely saddened that the SDLP has  set its face against the Bill. I listened to some Members in the Chamber today  talking about how we should not put Northern Ireland society into  silos, and yet that is just what is being done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been argued that there is no need for legislation in  Northern Ireland to make the  nation&rsquo;s commitment to the armed forces because there is no equivalent  legislation in the rest of the United    Kingdom. Public authorities in the rest of  the country are not under duties similar to those proposed in the Bill. The Welsh  Assembly has established an official group to address the needs of the service  community, and the Scottish Government have an all-party parliamentary group  working on it. The Governments in Scotland  and Wales are working in  lockstep with Westminster  on those issues. However, Northern Ireland  has no similar high-profile commitments and is operating at arm&rsquo;s length from  the wider UK  arrangements. Indeed, as others have said, Northern Ireland is lagging far  behind the rest of the United Kingdom in implementing the priorities set out in  the White Paper &lsquo;The Nation&rsquo;s Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed  Forces, their Families and Veterans&rsquo; around, in particular, housing, education  and support for families. Unsurprisingly, those areas of work are headed by  Ministers from the parties opposing the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Taking up Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s point, I will turn to that White  Paper. Prosthetic limb provision was delivered in England  in February 2009 and in Wales  in July 2009, and delivery is ongoing in Scotland. In Northern Ireland:  nothing. Priority and affordable homes were delivered in Wales and Scotland in May 2009 and July 2008  respectively. In Northern    Ireland: nothing. Extending access to  affordable homes was delivered in England  in July 2008, in Wales in  May 2009 and in Scotland  in July 2008. High-priority adapted social housing was delivered in England in  April 2009. A revised code applies in Wales and was due to be delivered  in November 2010. I understand that that has been delivered. In Scotland, that  was delivered in June 2009. The affordable homes means test was delivered in England in July 2008, in Wales in May 2009 and in Scotland in  July 2009. In Northern    Ireland: nothing. The disabled facilities  grant means test was delivered in England  in July 2008, in Wales in  May 2009 and in Scotland  in April 2009. In Northern    Ireland: nothing. The establishment of a  local connection for social housing was delivered in England  in December 2008, in Wales  in March 2009 and was on track to be completed in Scotland by the end of last year.  In Northern Ireland:  nothing. The acceptance of certification of cessation is in place in England. A  revised code of guidance was due in Wales at the end of last year. Scotland  delivered it in February 2009. Improved school place allocation was delivered  in England in February 2009  and in Wales  in July 2009. I could go on. However, I have given ample examples of how  ex-servicemen in Northern Ireland,  who make the same commitment as their colleagues in England,  Scotland and Wales, continue  to be discriminated against. Ironically, the Department that is responsible for  most of that is the Department for Social Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The parties across the way spend their time preaching about  equality and human rights, yet they are entirely comfortable denying those same  rights to members of the armed forces and their families. They should be  ashamed in bringing the Bill down on those grounds. What message is the SDLP  sending to the Royal British Legion, to ex-servicemen&rsquo;s associations, to former  policemen of the RUC and the &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he agree that many of those who served  in the armed forces had their basic human right to life taken away, as happened  on many occasions in this Province, by people who I believe were working  against this society and against this community? Some of those people may be  sitting in here tonight.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I agree entirely with the Member and thank him for his contribution. The most  basic human right is the right to life. Too many people in Northern Ireland,  some 3,000 of them, lost that most basic of human rights.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly also mentioned that only 13 representations were  made on the Bill. The reason for that, as members of the Committee will  remember, is that so many of those ex-servicemen&rsquo;s organisations simply did not  have the capacity to make a contribution. In itself, that is very telling of  the failure of this state to support those who have given, in many cases, their  limbs and whose friends have given their life.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Mrs Kelly made an insinuation as to why there  were &ldquo;so few&rdquo; responses to the consultation. However, Members in this House,  including the SDLP, said that there was huge public outcry about another  private Member&rsquo;s Bill backed by the Member for East Belfast Dawn Purvis.  However, there were only eight responses to that public consultation. Responses  to public consultations are not a reason to oppose legislation such as this.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  The attitude of the nationalist and republican parties respectively  demonstrates precisely why the legislation is required in this area. Left to  their own devices, they will do nothing to support the armed services  community. Indeed, it demonstrates why even stronger legislation is needed.  This should serve as ample evidence to the United Kingdom Government that  nationwide action is required to ensure that servicemen and women in and from Northern Ireland  are not disadvantaged through what looks like naked sectarian decision-making.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the concept of equality and a shared future. I  commend equality of citizenship across our United Kingdom. I urge parties that  claim to seek human rights not to discriminate against our brave service  personnel but to have courage and deliver equality and fairness to the people  who have made the ultimate sacrifice when supporting their family and to those  who travel the world, particularly those in Iran,  Iraq and Afghanistan, to  support freedom and democracy. Yet, those so-called democrats deny them  equality in their own country.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: It  is difficult to follow a speech that has been so well researched,  comprehensively argued and factually detailed on the reasons why this Bill is  reasonable, necessary and proportionate to the men and women who serve in our  armed forces.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer Members to the personal testimony of one young man  from Strangford. He has a camera that his father bought for him on his head. He  knows what it is like to come under live fire. What we are asking these men and  women to do is to walk waist-deep &mdash; sometimes chest-deep &mdash; through freezing  ravines in Afghanistan,  fully tooled up and fully armed. These young men of 19 and 20 years of age and  young women walk through ravines because of the risk of improvised explosive  devices. As they walk through those ravines, they come under sustained gunfire  attack from Taliban elements. In seconds, they have to choose whether to return  fire, not wishing to inflict any form of harm &mdash; what is referred to as  collateral damage &mdash; on innocent men and women in those communities. Not  returning fire often places them at greater risk. They then have to go back  into some of the communities in Afghanistan  and help to rebuild homes, schools and infrastructure and to provide  protection. That is not their job for eight hours a day; that is their job for,  at times, 24 hours a day. That is what our men and women are being sent by a  democratic act of Parliament to achieve. It is shameful that, in many cases,  those men and women have been let down through poor equipment and inadequate  planning. Sadly &mdash; I say this with deep regret &mdash; they will be let down again by  a twisted use of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The facts are very clear. I say to the self-proclaimed  prophets and prophetesses of equality, &ldquo;If you cannot have equality of all, you  cannot have equality at all&rdquo;. The Members who will go through the Lobby tonight  and use the perversion of a petition of concern to deny equality will hereafter  lose their moral right to talk on equality again. The Equality Commission  looked at the Bill, the Equality Commission scrutinised the Bill, and the  Equality Commission said that there is no case to answer.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Committee, where were the Members who had concerns?  Where did they raise those concerns? I will give way if they will raise them or  at least explain why they failed to do their job in the OFMDFM Committee. The  silence from the prophetess of equality is deafening. She is happy to get into  bed with Sinn F&eacute;in. Moments ago, she attacked its members and referred to them  as communists. Now, she laughs about young men and women, many of whom come  from the community that she professes to represent.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should refer his remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: She  lets them down with laughter, and she lets them down by failing to do her job  in Committee. She also lets them down because, when she does not offer equality  to all, she cannot offer equality at all. There is nothing funny about the men  and women of our communities running the risks that they do. As for laughing,  she should be ashamed of herself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The vote will be lost, but the argument will be won. Never  again can those who will go through the Lobbies and deny equality have any  moral authority to speak in the House on equality. There should be a military  contract. I am not saying that everybody has to agree with conflict and wars,  whether they are in Afghanistan  or anywhere else. It is a democratic right and choice to not agree with them,  but it is not a choice for the men and women who serve and who are sent into  situations of severe conflict by a democratic act of Parliament. It is not a  choice not to support them, and it is not a choice to handicap them by not  providing the services that other people receive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Strangford colleague Mr McNarry is to be strongly  congratulated. He will win the argument and the moral authority on the issue  this evening. Historians will look back on this shameful episode. Sinn F&eacute;in may  have been trapped by its history and bias, but the reality is that the SDLP has  come in as its little helper to deny equality. Mr McNarry is to be  congratulated, because the moral authority has been won. The case has been  presented on homes, prosthetic limbs and access to services. All that the Bill  asked for was a level playing field, not an advantage in west Belfast for a home or access to a service. It  asked for a simple level playing field of the type that is so comprehensively  offered in other parts of our United    Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are those who will carry the shame because of their  fear of the electorate coming at them from elements in Sinn F&eacute;in. They are  prepared to lose the moral authority, to deny equality and to not offer those  men and women a level playing field. If that is not naked sectarianism, I do  not know what is. They still have a chance tonight. They can abstain and allow  one Member to go through. Will they take it? That is a choice for them and  their conscience, but they will be reminded at every stage in all future  debates that their self-professed commitment to equality is bogus and  hypocritical. All that was looked for was a level of co-ordination and access  to housing and healthcare on the same basis as everybody else. Many of us who  have worked in social services know about the damage that can be done to  children who are moved many times. They were offered services on the basis that  the number of times that they had to move had had a significant effect on the  quality of their education and on their development potential. It was not to  give them a hand up; it was solely to bring those children to the level that  others of the same age, stage and circumstances would have achieved without  that level of trauma as a result of so many moves. All that was being asked for  was that the children of military personnel who have suffered so much due to  the loss of a loved one should be offered services to allow them to compete on  a level playing field with children of the same age, stage and circumstances  and to achieve their developmental potential.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill has been scrutinised by the Committee for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which found nothing to  object to. It was scrutinised by the Equality Commission, which, having  subjected the matter to due legal diligence, came back formally and on the  record to say that there were no detrimental equality implications, damning  totally the argument that people are looking for a special advantage. That is  on record, so now let the vote be taken and recorded. From now on, let those  who chose to deny equality live with their conscience. You cannot support the  Equality Commission today and not support it tomorrow. You cannot cherry-pick  the bits that you want and ignore the rest. If, on a nakedly sectarian  platform, you ignore the Equality Commission tonight, you demean your argument  for equality and fail to disguise your sectarian blushes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The argument has been won, and the level playing field will  be achieved. The sectarianism, poor level of debate, lack of argument and  ignorance about the Equality Commission that we have witnessed will not  survive, and it is clear that those who refuse to support equality are doing so  simply because the Bill involves men and women of the armed forces. Naked  prejudice has been revealed tonight, and it is a shame that the election will  not cover your blushes. History will record that tonight the Equality  Commission told you that the Bill had no equality implications &mdash; none. History  will record that tonight, although young people deserve better from this  society, you chose not to allow a level playing field, and, should your choice  of Lobby reinforce inequality, history will record your shame.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. On a wider issue, does he agree that the  amendments will strengthen the Bill?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Yes, I support that argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is self-evident that history will record that, today,  every Member was afforded an opportunity to create a level playing field and  equality for the armed services and veterans, without impacting negatively on  any section 75 groups. That opportunity was not taken. Instead, the perverse  use of a petition of concern reinforced a sectarian path. I am glad that my  name will not be recorded among those who missed that opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  As many Members know, I am extremely pleased to speak to the amendments to the  Armed Forces and Veterans Bill. I declare an interest as a former member of the  armed forces with the Household Cavalry, the Black Watch and, in the  Territorial Army, with the North Irish Horse. I am very proud to have served  with them all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have heard, this Bill is to give our armed  forces, past and present, equality with their colleagues in the rest of the United Kingdom, in England,  Scotland and Wales. It is  not to give them preference but to stop them being discriminated against.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I go into the clauses, I want Members to think about  what our armed forces do for us around the world. Think of the Navy, stationed  off Somalia,  trying to prevent the pirates from kidnapping people as we have seen recently.  A few years ago the Army, including one of our Irish regiments, was trying to  keep the peace in Sierra    Leone. We have also seen the Army in Iraq, toppling  Saddam Hussein, freeing the people and stopping the persecution of the Kurds.  Just under 200 soldiers have paid the final penalty. The Army is today in Afghanistan,  with the support of the RAF and the Navy, to stop al-Qaeda purging the world  and trying to get its own way. Also, let us not forget, the Army is there to  try to stop the flow of drugs, which are very much a curse of our world,  through the eastern bloc to Europe.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those servicemen are our peacekeepers, protectors,  guardians and, to many of us, our heroes, especially those who have served  here. They go where the politicians send them. They are just doing their duty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On that slightly sombre thought, I move to the amendments,  which seem to have been forgotten about. Clause 1 of the Bill requires certain  authorities to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;have due regard to the impact the exercise of such  functions is likely to have&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">on members of the armed forces, veterans and their  families. Amendment No 1 allows the Assembly to add authorities, other than  Departments, so that such people can be looked after properly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are not just talking about the present armed forces. I  remind Members that the forces had a United Nations role in Korea, Cyprus  and many other areas, including, recently, Serbia  and Bosnia.  They were there protecting people and keeping the peace. We seem to forget  that, as some Members blacken the name of those who are wearing uniform.  Members should remember that, in many cases, the forces include servicemen from  all parts of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was sad to see members voting against the amendments as  we put them through in the Committee. It shows us that some Members of the  Assembly have not moved on and still see soldiers as imperialists, though those  days are long gone. Those Members are still anti-Royal Family and basically  anti-Army. Many of them are still probably anti-police, despite sitting on the  Policing Board. It is time they moved on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 of the Bill relates to the appointment of a  co-ordinator:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to take responsibility for identifying and addressing  matters&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">that affect members of the armed forces, veterans  and their families. Amendment No 2 lets the Department make regulations  prescribing functions of the co-ordinator, again subject to the draft approval  of the Assembly. I want Members to know that here we are talking about the  families; until now, I have concentrated on those serving. Their families have  endless postings and endless moves away from their families and established  friends into quarters, which are sometimes pretty ghastly, where they have to  live in their own small world and suffer endless separation from the things that  they know. Many of the wives and families live in fear of the awful phone call  that might come their way one day when their loved ones are serving abroad. For  all of that, there is very little pay for what they are doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very disappointed that the petition of concern is  blocking this Bill and disappointed to see that Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP have not  moved on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dare I touch on the other amendments? We agree with  amendment Nos 3 to 9, all of which are purely technical.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I thought that we were moving on here. I intend to  move on, I have moved on, and I support the concept of equality. We are all  still haunted by that ghastly phrase:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t gone away, you know.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to put that phrase behind us and obliterate it. I  was shocked &mdash; or maybe not when I think about it &mdash; when, at Committee, Martina  Anderson pointedly asked me whether I was going to declare an interest as a  soldier after I had forgotten to do so one occasion. I wondered whether she was  going to declare an interest as a member of another armed force. That should be  kept in mind throughout all of this. I want Northern Ireland to move on, and I  thought that we had moved on. Today has put us back irrevocably, and I hope  that things will change in the future. I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I offer warm thanks to all my colleagues who have stayed behind to support my  Bill. I also recognise that you, Mr Speaker, the Commission staff,  administrative staff and others remain in the Building as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party leader, Tom Elliott, the Chairperson of the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister went  to some length to outline the Committee&rsquo;s role and the work that it did to  reach its report stage. I am glad that he did, because there is something of an  additional deceit on the part of those who tabled the petition of concern. They  did not stop to think of the amount of work that goes into getting a Bill such  as mine to the stage at which it is presented here this morning. We talked  earlier about costs and how we might save money, but that really did not  happen. Somewhere down the line, there is a lesson there for us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I happen to believe that if you have something to say, get  it out and say it. I am disappointed by what has happened and by the manner in  which it has been dealt with. On the two occasions that I was in front of the  Committee, I knew exactly where Sinn F&eacute;in members stood. Even before I spoke, a  Deputy Speaker of this institution and member of that Committee, when asked by  the Chairman whether anybody had a comment to make on the Bill shouted out  &ldquo;Scrap it.&rdquo; That is not the type of democracy that we want to foster when it  comes to anybody&rsquo;s entitlement and right to sponsor a Bill. I would like to get  rid of certain things, but we have to allow the legitimate right of every  Member, as equals in the House, to present their case. &ldquo;Scrap it&rdquo; was my  introduction to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view on my Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, I do not want to think that I was stupid  in believing that Members would not say that to me in this institution, that  they would not disrespect my Britishness so much and that they would not kick  me in the crotch where it hurts when they knew damn rightly that what they were  saying was highly offensive. Maybe I will meet the same people tomorrow or the  next day. Maybe we will say hello. They remind me that certain people in the  House will not even get into a lift with them, but that was never me. I have  always asked that they share in my country as it is, but they have told me  tonight that they will not do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to Tom Elliott because, as Chairperson of the  Committee, he was, at all times, courteous. Indeed, that courtesy was afforded  to me by the Committee in general. However, I felt that one side of the table,  apart from Stephen Farry, was a cold place for me. If a unionist feels that any  part of this institution is a cold place, we have not travelled very far, but  that is where we are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Tom for his reference to equality, and I am sure  that his reference and that of other Members to the equality issue will live on  long after the debate. The debate will not be forgotten, and it certainly will  not be put to bed. I also thank him for sharing a personal insight into his  service, as did other Members subsequently. He outlined clearly the meaning of  service, particularly highlighting the distinction that I and others can see.  There is a difference between those who gave service to their country and  identified themselves by their uniform and those who, without identifying  themselves, resorted to the most horrendous violence in recent times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Jimmy Spratt for his kind words and for supporting  my Bill at Committee Stage. It is clear that Jimmy also recognised the key  element of the Bill &mdash; a word that cropped up in the contribution of nearly  every Member &mdash; as equality, which deliberately punctuates the Bill, because it  is lacking currently. I share with him his disturbance, which is a good choice  of word, at the resurrection this morning of pan-nationalism. I am not one to  subscribe to the view that it has been resurrected because of elections or  because one bit of green did not want to be less green than the other. I  challenge those parties by saying that it never went away. It has always been  there, but the Bill has brought it out and exposed it, and that saddens me very  deeply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Jimmy&rsquo;s contribution, Peter Weir, Roy Beggs and Mr  Ross intervened to ask whether, even at this stage of knowing what was on the  Floor, one of the 44 Members who signed the petition would walk through the  Lobby with us to give cross-community consent to the Bill. The heads shook to  indicate no. I thank my colleagues for at least putting that to Members across  the way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The petitioners have said nothing that challenged my  introductory comments. The spurious remarks about preferential treatment remain  on the record, and they will remain spurious. Sadly, all I could hear were lame  excuses. There was no give and no equality, only hatred, and it was not even  disguised. Let the record show that 44 petitioners signed the petition and 44  stay locked and resolved to be together as one. The reformation of the  pan-nationalist front is what you have put together here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Stephen Farry for his unusual, unique way of taking  logic to actually mean something tonight. I appreciate that. I recognise his  methodology of process and how he changed his view, and it was good of him to  say it. He changed his view after hearing evidence from the Equality  Commission. Who asked the Equality Commission to attend? I cannot speak for  Stephen, but I assumed that he wanted it there because there were challenges  coming from Sinn F&eacute;in Members in particular saying that the Bill does not build  itself up on equality issues. The Equality Commission came and confirmed what I  knew was contained in the Bill. I thank Stephen for that. I am not sure what he  is doing with amendment No 2, but I can accept it and thank him for supporting  the Bill. It has been gratifying to have that support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank George Robinson for his support for the Bill from  day one and for his clear understanding of the genuine intentions behind the  Bill. From day one, he saw where we were with it, what was required and how it  could be brought forward. We have all had a knock back. When George and I  talked about it, we never thought that it would be blocked at this stage or at  any stage along the way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank William Humphrey. He expressed his  disappointment with the Members who are blocking the Bill. He knows better than  most the extent of the needs of the wider services&rsquo; family and the  disadvantages that they need not suffer in Northern   Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom. It is almost  insufferable, as William illustrated when he read out the list of how other  people who were previously disadvantaged in the same category as this are no  longer disadvantaged. What do we say to those people? Do we say that this part  of the United Kingdom is  different from England, Scotland and Wales? I cannot say that, and I do  not know how I can find a way round a veto, because this place does not allow  me to find a way round it, unless we find that the Members who are doing this  tonight have a conscience that we could prick. Let us see if there is still  time to prick that conscience between now and when we go to the vote.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Bell took us into the life of the person that my  Bill would offer to help, should they fail to return home safely. He told us  what it was like from his experience of talking to a person in our  constituency. He also gave a very succinct and distinct message to the  petitioners. He told them that, essentially, they have lost their right to talk  about equality. So they have. I believe that that sentiment, which was  expressed by Jonathan, will be heard loudly in all families, not just unionist  families, when news of what has happened in the House breaks in our country in  the next couple of days.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Danny Kinahan declared his service record in  the armed services. He even told us how he recoiled when asked to declare it in  Committee. He was asked to do that for a very distinct reason. He gave us a  good insight into what the services do as peacekeepers. Thankfully, he talked  about scrutinising the amendments, which is what we were meant to do in the  debate. I think that we have all been knocked off a bit by what has happened. I  thank Danny for, technically, bringing us back to the amendments. He reminded  us why the amendments strengthen the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sense his will to move on and I empathise with it. I know  that we have all had that will knocked back. I sense his resolve, like mine and  that of other unionists, to move on and keep moving on to keep growing this  country of ours into what it should be and to get what we want from it, which  is a place where all men and women are equal and where there are no special  privileges for anyone. I defy anyone to tell me where in my Bill it conferred  special privileges on anyone who wore a uniform. It was putting right a wrong &mdash;  a right and a wrong that were both recognised in England,  Scotland and Wales. The  Assembly could not step up to the mark to do the same.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part of their problem is the reference to a nation. The  Bill comes from the nation&rsquo;s charter, which is a command paper. You do not  accept this as a nation, do you? That is very sad. It is also very sad that, in  the Assembly, the uniform of our armed forces cannot be recognised and  respected. The sadness will rest with you.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, I still wait to see whether my colleagues  and I have pricked just one conscience and whether one of you will follow us  and walk through the Lobby with us to enable the Bill to progress to its next  stage. Let it advance and, for goodness&rsquo; sake, turn away from disadvantaging  people who do you no harm. All that I ask is that one of you does that. Forty-four  of you signed that petition of concern. I do not know where the rest of you  are. I ask that one of you has had your conscience pricked enough to come and  walk with us to progress the Bill to its next stage. Please, think about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That amendment No 1 be made, put and agreed  to.</p>
